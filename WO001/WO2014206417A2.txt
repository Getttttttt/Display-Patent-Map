abstract
    Described is a method as well as an apparatus for removing vaporizable contaminants from a particulate material, by which method the contaminants are inhibited from escaping the compartment at the second end together with the particulate material and transporting the vaporized contaminants towards the first end together with the venting gas, said venting gas acting as a carrier gas, condensing contaminants onto said particulate material in a condensing temperature region having temperatures higher than the initial temperature but lower than the vaporizing temperature such that the contaminants are inhibited from escaping the compartment at the first end together with the venting gas such that said contaminants are continuously vaporized and condensed in an internal vaporization-condensation cycle in the compartment thereby gradually accumulating the contaminants in the compartment. The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the method and the use of such apparatus.
