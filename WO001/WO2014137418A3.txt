abstract
    A gas turbine engine is disclosed having a recuperator that in one form is powered by an electrical generator driven by the gas turbine engine. The recuperator can be disposed with a compressor discharge of the gas turbine engine and can take a variety of forms such as a vane or tube. The gas turbine engine can be configured to operate in a variety of modes at least some of which use a thermal energy from the recuperator to heat a flow stream of the gas turbine engine. An energy storage device can be used with the generator to provide power to a load as the gas turbine engine is operated in a power mode.
