abstract
    In one aspect, an integrated expander and pump assembly is disclosed that includes: a housing defining an internal chamber and a pair of parallel helical rotors disposed within the housing internal chamber. The assembly can include a first working fluid inlet and a first working fluid outlet between which the working fluid is expanded by the rotors. The assembly can also include a second working fluid inlet and a second working fluid outlet between which the working fluid is pumped by the rotors.
