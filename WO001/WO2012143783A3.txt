abstract
    Waste heat steam generator (1 ) for the cooling of hot waste gases (5) from metallurgical processes, whereat the waste heat steam generator ( 1 ) contains at least one radiation chamber ( 2 ) and in the front part ( 3 ) of the radiation chamber ( 2 ) nozzles ( 4 ) with feed lines ( 7 ) to the nozzles ( 4 ) for feeding an oxygen-containing gas ( 6 ) to the radiation chamber ( 2 ) and whereat mixing of the oxygen-containing gas ( 6 ) with the waste gas ( 5 ) occurs by means of the injected oxygen-containing gas ( 6 ) and after-reactions are initiated at constituents of the waste gas ( 5 ), and whereat the feed lines ( 7 ) of the nozzles ( 4 ) are provided with means ( 8 ), which effect a pulsating feeding of the oxygen-containing gas ( 6 ), as well as a method for operating such a waste heat steam generator (figure 1 )·
