abstract
    The electric motorcycle (M) comprises a support frame, a rear wheel (RW), a front wheel (FW), an electric propulsion motor (E), an electronic control unit (2) for driving the electric motor (E) and a wheel anti-lock system (1) operatively connected to the control unit (2), the system (1) having detection means (18) of a slippage condition (SLP) of at least one of the wheels (RW, FW) and limiting means (19) operatively connected to the detecting means (18), able to receive at input at least a maximum regeneration torque value (RTMAX) of the electric motor (E) of the electric motorcycle (M) and able to limit the maximum regeneration torque (RTMAX) in case of detection of the slippage condition (SLP), wherein the system (1) comprises verification means (20) of the friction conditions of the wheels (RW, FW) on the road surface, in order to verify the presence or not of a high friction condition (HIGH MU) or a low friction condition (LOW MU), wherein the limiting means (19) are operatively connected to the verification means (20) and, in case of detection of the slippage condition (SLP), are able to limit the maximum regeneration torque (RTMAX) according to the high friction (HIGH MU) or low friction (LOW MU) condition, and wherein the verification means (20) of the friction conditions comprise: a first detection unit (35) able to detect the high friction condition (HIGH MU) according to at least an acceleration value (AV ACC), a pressure value (PI) of a front brake of the electric motorcycle (M) and an instantaneous torque value (T IN) of the electric motor (E); a second detection unit (36) able to detect the low friction condition (LOW MU) according to at least a pressure value (PI) of a front brake of the electric motorcycle (M) and an instantaneous torque value (T IN) of the electric motor (E)-
