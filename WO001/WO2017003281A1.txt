abstract
    Enthalpy-exchanging unit comprising at least one plate along whose at least one contact side a first flowable medium and a second medium can travel while exchanging enthalpy, and which enthalpy-exchanging unit comprises at least one hygroscopic material layer, which connects to at least one contact side, in contact with the first flowable medium, of the plate, wherein the mutual orientation of the plate and the material layer is such that a liquid film of the first medium can form between the plate and the material layer, wherein the liquid film is in enthalpy-exchanging contact with both the plate and the material layer, characterized in that the material layer is fastened to the plate with a plurality of seams, which extend substantially parallel to one another and are continuous, such that a plurality of channels separated from one another by the seams are formed over the contact side of the plate, with the aim of increasing the degree of spread of the first flowable medium over the contact side of the plate, and thus, on the one hand, reducing the influence of cohesion between the liquid molecules and the accompanying surface tension and, on the other hand, increasing the influence of the adhesion between the flowable medium and the plate, wherein an more even liquid supply without the use of nozzles is secured, by on the top side a supply unit provided with a porous, absorbent bed.
