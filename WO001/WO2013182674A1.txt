abstract
    The present invention relates to a brake control system for a motor vehicle having front and rear axles. The brake control system includes a controller operable in response to a braking request signal. The controller is configured to control a front axle braking system for applying a front axle braking force and a rear axle braking system for applying a rear axle braking force. The controller is configured to increase the front axle braking force to supplement the rear axle braking force when an operational parameter relating to the rear axle braking system is greater than or equal to a pre-defined threshold. The invention also relates to a method of controlling the braking of a motor vehicle.
