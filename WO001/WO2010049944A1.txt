abstract
    A hydrogen carburetor for generating hydrogen to run an internal combustion engine and method thereof are described. In one embodiment, the system includes a heat absorber tank coupled to said engine to absorb heat energy exhausted by the engine during runtime; a water tank to supply distilled water to said heat absorber tank, wherein the distilled water is heated up using the absorbed heat energy; a steam electrolysis chamber to split hydrogen and oxygen gases from the injected heated distilled water by porous electrolysis, wherein heated distilled water is injected when the temperature in the chamber rise to a threshold value; a temperature sensing controller coupled to said chamber to sense the temperature in the chamber; a hydrogen compressor connected to a porous anode element of said chamber to collect and compress the generated hydrogen; and a fuel storage tank to store the hydrogen gas and to supply the hydrogen to the internal combustion engine through an engine carburetor or a fuel injector or a fuel air mixer. In another embodiment, the method involved thereof is described.
