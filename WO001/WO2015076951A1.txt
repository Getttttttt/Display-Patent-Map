abstract
    A heating, cooling, and power device includes a shaft and an expander coupled to the shaft to rotate the shaft. A first conduit is coupled to the expander and configured to transport a working fluid. A heater is coupled through the first conduit to the expander. A heat pump is coupled to the shaft. An electric machine is coupled to the shaft to produce electricity or mechanical shaft power. A recuperator includes a second conduit coupled between the expander and recuperator. The heat pump includes a first heat exchanger including a second conduit coupled between the expander and the first heat exchanger. An expansion device includes a third conduit coupled between the first heat exchanger and the expansion device. A second heat exchanger includes a fourth conduit coupled between the expansion device and second heat exchanger. A compressor is coupled to the shaft.
