abstract
    A method of operating a channel induction furnace to process a feed material and obtain therefrom at least one of a molten metal product, a vapor phase metal product and a slag product. The method includes applying a controlled vacuum on the headspace of the channel induction furnace to controlling the amount of ambient air that enters the furnace or adding oxygen into the channel induction furnace. The method also includes controlling the carbon concentration in the molten bath in the channel induction furnace to control the fluidity of the bath.
