abstract
    A solar energy collection system for a building enclosure with an insulated building envelope allows excess solar gains to be captured, stored and used for subsequent heating. The system controls operation of a fenestration assembly that has an adjustable R-value. The fenestration assembly can be controlled to allow additional solar gains to be captured and the captured heat and used for subsequent heating when required.
