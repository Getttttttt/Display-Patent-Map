abstract
    In a first aspect, the invention is directed to a wheel assembly for a vehicle, including a wheel, a brake, an electric motor, and optionally a gearbox, and a support structure that supports the motor, the wheel and the optional gearbox if a gearbox is provided. The brake includes a brake disk that rotates with the wheel, and a caliper, which is itself made up of first and second caliper portions. The first caliper portion is formed directly in the support structure.
