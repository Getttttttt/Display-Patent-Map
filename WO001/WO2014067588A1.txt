abstract
    Disclosed is an improved method for generating electric power from a chlorine-containing combustible stream comprising the steps of (a) plasma gasification to generate a hot chlorine-containing synthesis gas, (b) generating high pressure steam using heat from this hot synthesis gas, (c) removing chlorine from the synthesis gas to form a low-chlorine synthesis gas, (d) using this low CI synthesis gas as fuel in a gas turbine driving a first electric power generator, (e) using heat from the hot exhaust gasses from the gas turbine to superheat the high pressure steam from step (b), and (f) feeding the superheated steam to a steam turbine driving a second electric power generator.
