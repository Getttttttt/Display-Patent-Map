abstract
    A boiler or water heating system (10) includes a coiled heat exchange tube (18) having a major diameter and a minor diameter and a gap defined between adjacent turns of the tube (18), the tube (18) also having a non-circular cross-section with a dimension along a major axis (J) that is larger than a dimension along a minor axis (N), the major axis (J) of the non-circular cross-section of the heat exchange tube (18) being non-perpendicular to a coil axis (22) of the heat exchange tube (18) thereby providing a surface of the tube (18) extending between the major and minor diameters of the heat exchange tube ( 18) that promotes the gravitational migration of condensate along the surface of the heat exchange tube (18) and through the gap defined between adjacent turns of the heat exchange tube (18) in a direction toward or away from the coil axis (22).
