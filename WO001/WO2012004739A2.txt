abstract
    The present invention relates to a biomass power plant (1). This plant (1) comprises a heat generator (2) comprising a burner (3) suitable for said biomass combustion, wherein to said combustion a flame and biomass combustion fumes are associated, a thermodynamic cycle electric energy production assembly (5), a main heat-exchanger (6) in communication with the burner (3) which puts the burner (3) and the electric energy production assembly (5) in a heat-transfer relationship. The main heat-exchanger (6) comprises a first plurality of pipes (21) which develop as a helix, delimiting a heat-transfer chamber (23) in the main heat-exchanger (6), and a second plurality of pipes (22) in fluid communication with the first plurality of pipes (21) which develop as a helix, externally at least partially encircling the first plurality of pipes (21). These first (21) and second (22) pluralities of pipes are adapted to carry a working fluid and are in fluid communication with the electric energy production assembly (5) such as to transfer to it, through said working fluid, part of the heat developed in the burner (3) during the biomasses combustion for implementing said thermodynamic cycle. The burner (3) is configured and arranged in respect to the heat-transfer chamber (23) such that, during the biomasses combustion, the flame develops at least partially within said heat-transfer chamber (23), so that the working fluid in the first plurality of pipes (21) is heated by convection by the fumes and by radiation by the combustion flame.
