abstract
    This invention relates to a method of conveniently functionalizing the reducing end of a carbohydrate polymer. The method also allows for the length of the polymer to be differentially functionalized. The invention provides a method for preparing polymers with a different functional groups or functionality on the sides than on the reducing end. An advantage of the method of the invention is that the procedures are simpler, preferably requiring less time, fewer steps, reduced temperatures and less harsh chemical components than conventional procedures for differential modification, with the further advantage that the reactions can be carried out in aqueous media.
