abstract
    The device producing electricity and heat from biomass or biomass waste in the form of pellets or briquettes (1) includes one cogeneration unit (2) consisting of a gas section and a gas combustion engine (3) or a turbine with a generator (4) producing electricity for the public distribution network and an ORC device (5) producing electricity for the public distribution network. It further consists of a gas source for the cogeneration unit (2) and a heat source for the ORC device (5), and a drier (7) connected to the cogeneration unit (2) and to the ORC device (5). The gas section for the cogeneration unit (2) and the heat source for the ORC device (5) consists of a pyrolysis reactor (8) for pyrolysis combustion of pellets or briquettes (1). The pyrolysis reactor (8) is connected to the input to the gas combustion engine (3) or the turbine. The pyrolysis reactor (8) involves an oil circuit (15), connected to the input into the ORC device (5). The output of the heat (17) from the gas combustion engine (3) combustion gas leads to the circuit of the first heat exchanger (9), which is connected to the input into the ORC device (5).
