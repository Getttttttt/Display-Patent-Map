abstract
    Described is a plant for manufacturing cement, which plant comprises a preheater (1) for preheating cement raw materials suspended in gases, a bottom cyclone (11) for separating the preheated cement raw materials and the gases, said cyclone (11) having a central outlet duct (6) for separated gases, a kiln (5) for burning the calcined cement raw material into cement clinker, as well as a bypass duct (14) for removing volatile components, such as chloride, alkali and sulphur, from the cement manufacturing plant, which bypass duct (14) is located after the bottom cyclone (11) viewed in the direction of movement of the gases. The plant is peculiar in that the bypass duct (14) extends into the central area of the central outlet duct (6). It is hereby obtained, that the exhaust gases extracted through the bypass duct (14) contain a significant smaller amount of dust and also that the entrained dust constitutes the finest fraction of the dust leaving the bottom cyclone (11) with the exhaust gases. This is due to the fact that the dust concentration at the point of extraction via the bypass due to the swirling action of the exhaust gases is lowest in the central area of the central outlet duct.
