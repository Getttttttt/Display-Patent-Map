abstract
    A domestic heating system comprising a boiler (1 ) and a heat recovery module (2) arranged to preheat a thermal fluid directed to the boiler, by recovering heat from combustion fumes, said module (2) comprising at least one heat exchanger (10, 12) between said fumes and said thermal fluid, the system comprising a particulate removal system, adapted to remove particulate matter (PM) from the fumes, located upstream the heat exchanger(s) (10, 12) of the heat recovery module (2).
