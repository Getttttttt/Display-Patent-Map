abstract
    In Implosion Enabled Engine (IEE-X) is described herein. The IEE-X comprises at least one engine cylinder, and a piston movable in the engine cylinder. The engine cylinder comprises at least one inlet port provided on both sides of the piston for drawing in an inlet gas comprising a mixture of substantially pure hydrogen (H2) gas and substantially pure oxygen (O2) gas inside the engine cylinder, an igniting means provided on the cylinder wall for igniting the inlet gas in the engine cylinder, thereby producing an implosion of the inlet gas inside the engine cylinder, and at least one exhaust port provided on both sides of the piston for drawing out the exhaust gas from the engine cylinder.
