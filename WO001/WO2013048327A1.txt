abstract
    The invention is related to a method for controlling defrosting of a heat-exchanger (1). The method comprises determining a coefficient of utilization (η) of the heat-exchanger, then considering the coefficient of utilization (η), and then determine if the heat-exchanger requires defrosting. The invention is also related to a system for a heat-exchanger (1). The system for the heat-exchanger comprises measurement gear (11) at the heat-exchanger (1), wherein the measurement gear (11) is configured to collect data for the coefficient of utilization (η) of the heat-exchanger, which data is provided for use in a calculator unit (12) for calculating the coefficient of utilization (η). The calculator unit (12) is configured to send a signal (Sn) for the coefficient of utilization. The system also comprises an evaluation unit (14) configured to receive the signal (Sn) for the coefficient of utilization and determine if the heat-exchanger needs defrosting based on the coefficient of utilization (η).
