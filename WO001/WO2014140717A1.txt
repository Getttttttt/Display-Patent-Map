abstract
    The invention relates to a ventilation unit for providing supply air to an apartment or parts thereof and for removing return air from said apartment or parts thereof, said ventilation unit comprising: a supply air outlet for establishing supply air flow communication with said apartment; a return air inlet for establishing return air flow communication with said apartment; an exhaust air outlet for establishing exhaust air flow communication with the atmosphere; an outside air inlet for establishing outside air flow communication with the atmosphere; a heat exchanger having first air flow passages and second air flow passages for transferring heat energy from return air entering said first air flow passages and exhaust air leaving said first air flow passages on the one hand, to outside air entering said second air flow passages and supply air leaving said second air flow passages on the other hand; a first ventilator at a first location within the ventilation unit, for transporting air through a first air flow path starting at said return air inlet, passing through said first air flow passages in the heat exchanger and ending at said exhaust air outlet; and a second ventilator at a second location within the ventilation unit, for transporting air through a second air flow path starting at said outside air inlet, passing through said second air flow passages in the heat exchanger and ending at said supply air outlet. According to the invention, said first air flow path and said second air flow path comprise internal air flow ducts having rectangular cross sections.
