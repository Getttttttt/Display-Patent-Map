abstract
    A process for energy recovery and transfer including: warming fresh air in a heat recovery and pressure control unit; feeding waste feed and the warm fresh air into a processor; reducing a moisture content of the waste feed by breaking the waste feed into a fuel powder in the warm fresh air in the processor; filtering contaminated air through an initial filter to remove the fuel powder from the contaminated air; pre-heating the contaminated air in the heat recovery and pressure control unit; raising the temperature of the pre-heated contaminated air in a chamber; passing the chamber discharge air through the heat recovery and pressure control unit to pre-heat contaminated air passing on to the chamber and to warm fresh air passing on to the processor; and filtering terminal air through a terminal filter to remove particles from the terminal air.
