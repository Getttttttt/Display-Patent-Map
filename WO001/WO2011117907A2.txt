abstract
    The present invention relates to a fumes-air type heat exchanger configured for heating units for boilers and essentially constituted of at least one exchanging body (2) closed by a pair of guards (3) wherein the exchanging body comprises two cavities, one internal (19) for the flow of fumes and the other around the perimeter for the flow of water to be heated where the cavity for the fumes is established within the core, i.e. the innermost part, and the cavity for the water to be heated in the jacket (20), i.e. the outermost part, so as to automatically reduce heat dispersion to the outside. In particular, the jacket (20) is composed of a hollow element divided into a plurality of longitudinal channels (21) inside each of which are protuberances (22a) arranged on the inner wall (23), while internally, in the core, there is a plurality of fins (50) arranged in a reciprocally parallel and opposing fashion. The heat exchanger is of the "cross flow" type, i.e. the input on the water side corresponds with the heat exchanger fumes output, thus allowing, with this configuration, high heat exchange performance because the low water temperature guarantees a sufficient level of condensation of combustion fumes, which are also at a low temperature.
