abstract
    Systems and processes for generating steam and/or hydrogen with reduced carbon dioxide emissions are provided. Prior to steam generation by combustion of fuel, typically methane or natural gas, the fuel is decomposed into a solid carbon material and gaseous hydrogen. The hydrogen is combusted to generate steam plus combustion-product steam, which may be injected into a subterranean formation to recover hydrocarbons. The produced hydrogen may also be used in bitumen upgrading operations. The invention aims to generate less carbon dioxide emissions than conventional processes, by sequestering carbon in solid form from the fuel prior to combustion for steam generation.
