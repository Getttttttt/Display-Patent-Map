abstract
    A kinetic energy recovery device (10; 110) for a vehicle provided with at least of one wheel (4) having a hub (6), it comprises at least one elastic accumulator (11; 111), which is configured for accumulating kinetic energy in the form of elastic energy, and comprises a mobile portion (20; 120, 127, 128); and at least one driving device (12; 112), which is coupled to the mobile portion (20, 120, 127, 128) of the elastic accumulator (11; 111) and the hub (6) and is configured to convert the movement of the mobile portion (20; 120, 127, 128) of the elastic accumulator. (11; 111) into a rotary motion of the hub (6) in the direction of travel of the vehicle (1); the driving device (12; 112) is provided with a first cable (75) provided with a first head (78) coupled to the mobile portion (20, 120, 127, 128) of the elastic accumulator (11; 111); and a free-wheeling element (76), which is coupled to a second head (79) of the first cable (75) and is configured in such a way that winding the first cable in a first sense (Ml) without transmitting a rotary motion to the hub (6) and to unwind the first cable (75) in a second sense (M2) opposite the first sense (Ml) and to transmit a rotary motion to the hub ( 6).
