abstract
    A vehicle drive system comprising three motor/generators, an engine and an electrical energy storage device. The system is arranged so that two axles can be driven at the same time. Each axle can be driven using power generated by the engine or provided by the electrical energy storage device. The system can also be configured to drive one of axles using mechanical power from the engine.
