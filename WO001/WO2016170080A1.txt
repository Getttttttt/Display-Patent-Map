abstract
    The present invention provides a boiler system, for example for use in heating a domestic hot water supply, and which is significantly more fuel efficient than existing boilers, the boiler system comprising a first reservoir and a second reservoir which together define a combustion enclosure, a storage tank positioned to define an upper wall or roof of the enclosure and being in fluid communication with the first water reservoir, a heat exchange tube located in the storage tank and being in fluid communication with the second water reservoir; and a burner arranged to directly heat atmospheric gases within the enclosure in order to indirectly heat the walls of the enclosure.
