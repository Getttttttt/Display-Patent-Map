abstract
    An energy supply system for a vehicle (2) includes electric (2) and hydraulic (40) supply systems. Monitoring means (12, 3, 14) detect a predetermined overload condition in the electric supply system, and control means (3, 70, 71) controllably dissipate or store energy in the hydraulic supply system in response to detection of an overload condition by the monitoring means.
