abstract
    Methods and associated apparatus for automatically growing agricultural crops vertically and/or in a continuous fashion throughout each year (Vertical Farm) in combination with contiguous and co-located production of biofuel, food, biomass for the purpose of carbon sequestering (carbon credits), and biomass electric power generation. A process that incorporates vast arrays of continuous-loop conveyors, towering upon vertical framework, which allow potted perennial plants to be transported throughout all stages of maturity in a manner which substantially multiplies yield per acre, allows production to proceed in both natural and artificial light, allows production and harvesting to be automated, and allows production to proceed in conditions which are highly favorable to plants but unfavorable to humans. The entire apparatus can be constructed of lightweight, cost-effective materials which afford mass-production and mass- array into vast automatic growing operations.
