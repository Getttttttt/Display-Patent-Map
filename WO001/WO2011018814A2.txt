abstract
    The invention concerns a method and a system for locally pressurizing a first circuit in which a vector fluid flows with an initial pressure coming from a heater and provided for the heat Exchange in a heat Exchange group with a second fluid flowing in another circuit with a second pressure higher than the first. On the outward line of the first circuit is inserted at least a pressurization means (31 ) to increase the vector fluid pressure upstream of the input in the heat exchange group up to a pressure corresponding to that of the second fluid. On the return line of the first circuit is inserted a means (32) for reducing the pressure for lowering the pressure of the vector fluid downstream of the exit of the heat exchanger group towards the heater.
