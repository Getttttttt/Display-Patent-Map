abstract
    A water extraction method and moisture extraction system are disclosed. Water is removed from the water vapor laden exhaust of a gas turbine electrical generator by first increasing the concentration of water vapor in that exhaust stream while passing it through a desiccant means to regenerate the desiccant and remove water from the desiccant. The exhaust stream exits the desiccant at a lower temperature and higher vapor content level, and is then passed through one or more heat exchangers to further lower the temperature of the exhaust stream and condense water vapor out of the stream. The condensed water from the heat exchanger is collected and used for other purposes. The turbine exhaust leaving the heat exchanger is then passed through the adsorption region of the desiccant device to transfer water vapor remaining therein to the desiccant to dry the exhaust air stream before exhausting it to the atmosphere.
