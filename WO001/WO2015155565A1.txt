abstract
    The invention pertains to a method: for regulating, the electrical power output of an incineration plant- the method -comprising the steps of: feeding fuel (e.g. refuse) into a combustion chamber of the incineration plant, generating heal by Incinerating the mi within the combustion chamber, generating steam from the heat for driving a steam turbine, which is configured for providing: electrical power, and regulating the electrical power output generated by the steam turbine in dependence of an estimate of inderterministic variations In the- price of electricity in addition to an estimation of empirical/deterministic variations in the price of electricity. The invention also pertains to art incineration plant for executing the method.
