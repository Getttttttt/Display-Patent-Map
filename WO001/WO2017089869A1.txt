abstract
    The purpose of the invention is to improve the efficiency of stoves, boilers, burners, fireplaces and internal combustion engines regarding heat recovery, and by doing so, clean the exhaust fumes. Complicated processes exist in industry but there is nothing simple for domestic use or applications requiring a temperature lower than 100°C. The invention is to accomplish, in only one step, the heat recovery and smoke cleaning. The one step wet scrubber can reduce the heat source temperature from 2000°C to less then 30°C, according to the application. As regulations evolve and global warming increases, solutions should be found at a reasonable cost. As the solution is simple, the cost is low and so the technology can be widely spread. The heat exchanger washing tower works by condensing most of the water of the exhaust fumes, allowing the system no necessity for water addition during the operation and the possibility to get an efficiency close to 100% (HHV) for a heating application. To give an example, such a technique allows the recovery of heat from a biomass burner with an efficiency of around 106% (Lower Heating Value, LHV, commonly used in Europe) or near 96% (Higher Heating Value, HHV, commonly used in North America). The different norms regarding the recovery of latent heat from water condensation, explain the value gap. That efficiency should be compared to the usual 70% HHV efficiency of a standard wood appliance. By improving a stove or boiler's efficiency considerably, the invention also allows the smoke treatment, which is never done for domestic applications.
