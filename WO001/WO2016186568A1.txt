abstract
    The present invention relates to a heat exchange device for heat transfer between a first fluid and a second fluid, wherein the heat exchange device comprises a cover with an inlet and an outlet and a flow direction between them, a plurality of plate elements, wherein each plate element comprises at least two ridges and wherein a plurality of plate elements are arranged in a stack inside the cover, so that the ridges run in the flow direction and so that the ridges of one plate element abut against corresponding ridges in adjacent plate elements, wherein the ridges define the walls of at least three fluid chambers, so that each fluid chamber is defined either by two ridges or by one ridge and one outer edge of the plate element, wherein each fluid chamber is arranged to be a first fluid chamber holding the flow of a first fluid or a second fluid chamber holding the flow of a second fluid, and wherein each first fluid chamber is adjacent to at least one second fluid chamber, and vice versa, and wherein the device is characterised by each fluid chamber being traversed by a plurality of plate elements.
