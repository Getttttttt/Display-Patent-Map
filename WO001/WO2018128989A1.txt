abstract
    An electrically powered vehicle is disclosed, having a resistor to facilitate dynamic breaking when the electrically powered vehicle is moving downhill or under other external motive force. The electrically powered vehicle includes one or more electrical motors configured to provide motive force to a powered wheel of the electrically powered vehicle. The one or more electrical motors can be configured to generate electricity when the electrically powered vehicle is moved by a force external to the electrically powered vehicle.
