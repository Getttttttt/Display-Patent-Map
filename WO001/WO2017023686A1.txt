abstract
    A number of variations may include a system which may include an Organic Rankine Cycle that may include at least a first boiler operatively connected to a vehicle engine system to recover waste heat therefrom. The Organic Rankine Cycle may include an organic working fluid. The Organic Rankine Cycle may be operatively connected to a turbocharger system to provide turbocharger assist using energy from the working fluid.
