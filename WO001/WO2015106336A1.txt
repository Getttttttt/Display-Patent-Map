abstract
    The system comprises an onboard controller that receives data from at least one vehicle motion sensor and signals an electrical charger to charge an onboard battery pack when a vehicle motion parameter in the data indicates the vehicle is in a condition for efficient electrical charging. The controller receives data from a vehicle speed sensor, and signals an electrical charger to charge an onboard battery pack when a vehicle speed parameter in the data indicates the vehicle is moving below a threshold speed for efficient electrical charging, for example when there is no electrical drain load on the battery pack from the drivetrain, and preferably not from electrically powered accessories on the vehicle as well. The charging would be deactivated when the state-of-charge of the battery pack was already such that commencement of or continuation of charging would be superfluous or detrimental to the battery pack.
