abstract
    A water distribution systems for heat and mass exchangers(l) is designed to improve the cooling efficiency of indirect evaporative coolers and may be applied in the different units which use basic cycles or advanced cycles for indirect evaporative air cooling. The improvement to the evaporating water distribution is by water pipes(6) with holes(8) inside wet channel(A-A). This solution guarantees that all of the evaporative layers will get adequate wetting, and the evaporation will be not limited by the water buildup. By an unique water distribution structure in the wet channels(A-A), uniform water film is created on the surfaces of evaporative media. This enlarges the wetting area of wet channels(A-A) with minimum water flow and allows the performance of the heat and mass transfer to be increased. The proposed water distribution system consumes very little energy for its operation, only a small pump, due to the lack of water nozzles which require high water pressure for operation. The energy efficiency of the system will therefore be extremely high.
