abstract
    A method of heat recovery from bulk solids includes introducing the bulk solids into an inlet of a heat exchanger for indirect heat exchange with water as the bulk solids flow, by gravity, from the inlet to an outlet of the heat exchanger, pumping the water into subcritical heating heat transfer elements within the heat exchanger for indirect heat exchange with the bulk solids to heat the water and thereby provide heated, pressurized water, and flashing off steam from the heated, pressurized water.
