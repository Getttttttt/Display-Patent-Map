abstract
    An exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and method. Embodiments EGR system include a source of coolant such as ORC working fluid, an EGR cooler, a mechanically actuated valve, and a thermal actuator such as a wax motor. The EGR cooler includes a recirculated exhaust gas chamber having an input to receive exhaust gas and an output to couple the exhaust gas to an engine, and a coolant chamber having an input. The coolant chamber is thermally coupled to the exhaust gas chamber. The mechanically-actuated valve is coupled between the source of coolant and the coolant chamber input. The thermal actuator actuates the valve, and includes a body positioned to be thermally coupled to exhaust gas flowing from the exhaust gas chamber.
