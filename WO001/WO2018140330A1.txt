abstract
    An air processing system is provided that is configured to monitor and control the quality and temperature of air within a building. The air processing system includes at least one temperature adjustment assembly (e.g., a heating/cooling system) used to heat or cool the air within the building and at least one dedicated outdoor air system ventilator used to circulate fresh air within the building wherein the air processing system is separate from the temperature adjustment assembly. The air processing system also includes an intelligent gateway formed as part of the ventilator and connected to the temperature adjustment assembly and the ventilator so as to monitor and control their operating conditions. The intelligent gateway may send the operating conditions and any sensor measurements to a cloud computing server that a user or technician can use to interface with the air processing system.
