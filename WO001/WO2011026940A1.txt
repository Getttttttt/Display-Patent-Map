abstract
    A TRT process and system for recovering energy from blast furnace top gas in an expansion turbine are disclosed. The over-pressurized blast furnace top gas stream released by a blast furnace (10) is subsequently passed through a top gas cleaning plant (12), a preheating unit (22) and an expansion turbine (24) coupled to a load (30). The top gas stream is warmed-up in a heat-exchanger (20) located in-between the top gas cleaning plant (12) and the pre-heating unit (22). The top gas flow, after expansion in the turbine (24), is fed through the heat-giving side of the heat-exchanger (20).
