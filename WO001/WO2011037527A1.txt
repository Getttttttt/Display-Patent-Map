abstract
    The invention relates to a thermal electric generator system (TEG system) (1) for extracting electricity from a waste heat medium (2) in a waste heat line (3) in a vehicle, which system (1) comprises a TEG unit (4) comprising: one or more thermal electric generator layers (TEG layers) (6) adapted to converting thermal energy to electricity and situated directly against the waste heat line (3), and an energy storage module (5) adapted to storing thermal energy and situated upstream of the TEG layer directly against the waste heat line (3), whereby thermal energy from the waste heat medium (2) is stored in the energy storage module (5). The TEG system (1) further comprises a bypass unit (8) comprising a bypass line (9) connected to the waste heat line (3) via an adjustable valve device (10) so that all or parts of the waste heat medium (2) can be led past the TEG unit (4) in the bypass line (9); and a valve control unit adapted to adjusting the valve device (10) when predetermined conditions are fulfilled, which valve control unit is adapted to adjusting the valve device (10) when vehicle signals such as, for example, brake signals or acceleration control signals indicate that the vehicle is being braked or accelerated.
