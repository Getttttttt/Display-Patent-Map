abstract
    An air conditioning system (10) using a refrigerant fluid (102) and a cooling liquid, the air conditioning system (10) comprising: a first compartment (22) defining a first air inlet (31) and a first air outlet (33) and a first ventilator (28) for creating a first air flow (35) through the first compartment (22) from the first air inlet (31) to the first air outlet (33); a first heat exchange unit (16) provided in the first compartment (22) for allowing heat exchange between the refrigerant fluid (102) and the first air flow (35) when the refrigerant fluid (102) is circulated through the first heat exchange unit (16); a second heat exchange unit (14) also provided in the first compartment (22) for allowing heat exchange between the refrigerant fluid (102) and the first air flow (35) when the refrigerant fluid (102) is circulated through the second heat exchange unit (14), the second heat exchange unit (14) being provided downstream from the first heat exchange unit (16) relatively to the first air flow (35), the second heat exchange unit (14) being in fluid communication with the first heat exchange unit (16) for allowing circulation of the refrigerant fluid (102) from the second heat exchange unit (14) to the first heat exchange unit (16). The second heat exchange unit (14) is a desuperheater in which the refrigerant fluid (102) is cooled down by the first air flow (35) while remaining gaseous and the first heat exchange unit (16) is a condenser in which the refrigerant fluid (102) condenses when cooled by the first air flow (35).
