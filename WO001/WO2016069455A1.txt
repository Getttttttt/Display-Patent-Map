abstract
    A waste heat recovery system comprising a pump fluidically coupled to an engine and configured to pump a coolant through the engine. A cooling circuit includes a radiator structured to cool the coolant, and a coolant boiler. The coolant boiler is fluidically coupled to the engine and the radiator and configured to extract heat from the coolant to heat a working fluid. A thermostat is fluidically coupled to the engine and the pump. The thermostat is configured to direct the coolant towards the cooling circuit (radiator and coolant boiler) when the engine reaches a predetermined temperature. The waste heat recovery system also includes a coolant control valve. The coolant control valve is in fluidic communication with the engine, the radiator and the coolant boiler. The coolant control valve is structured to selectively redirect heated coolant received from the engine towards the radiator or the coolant boiler.
