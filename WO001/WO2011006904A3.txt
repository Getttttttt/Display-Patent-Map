abstract
    The invention relates to the use of a rankine cycle apparatus, which transfers heat of the (relatively) hot waste streams (like off-gas or hot cooling water) into mechanical energy in a turbine to exert its mechanical forces for powering of the propellers or other propulsion means. Preferably, the mechanical energy is directly transferred to the shaft of a propeller, optionally with aid of gear-box. Alternatively, the energy from the turbine is used to power a generator, which transfers the mechanical energy into electricity, which electricity is used to generate mechanical energy for propulsion of the vessel, or to power apparatus on a vessel, which vessel is a high energy consumer, like cruise ship or cooling vessel.
