abstract
    The present invention refers to a heat exchanger (1) for the rapid cooling of flue gas of ironwork plants, comprising a support structure (2) of at least one module (100) which in turn comprises an inlet manifold (3) of the flue gas and an outlet manifold (4) of the flue gas which are mutually opposed and aligned, a plurality of panels (5) that extend between the inlet manifold (3) and the outlet manifold (4) and which are mutually superimposed at a defined distance, wherein pairs of adjacent panels (5) define flow channels (6) of the flue gas which are closed laterally by shoulders (7) and which have at opposite ends respectively an inlet aperture (8) in communication with the inlet manifold (3) and an outlet aperture (9) in communication with the outlet manifold (4), and circulation ducts (10) of a cooling fluid associated with the panels (5), first selective closing means (14) of the inlet apertures (8) of one or more of said channels (6) and second selective closing means (15) of the outlet apertures (9) of one or more said channels (6), wherein each of said channels (6) is laterally closed by a respective pair of shoulders (7) of which at least one is of the removable type.
