abstract
    A system for use in a motor vehicle having an internal combustion engine may include a generator configured to provide electric power to the motor vehicle and a pump configured to inject air into an exhaust stream of the internal combustion engine during an engine cold start and warm-up period and provide cooling air to the generator following the engine warm-up. The system may include a means for preventing the generator from overheating during the engine cold start and warm-up period. A method for providing cooling air to a generator on a motor vehicle having an internal combustion engine may include configuring a generator to provide electric power to the motor vehicle, and providing a pump configured to inject air into an exhaust stream of the internal combustion engine during an engine cold start and warm-up period and provide cooling air to the generator following the engine warm- up.
