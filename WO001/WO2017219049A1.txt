abstract
    The invention relates to method for producing nano carbon C60 - C70 comprises following steps: a) carbonizing organic carbonaceous materials to obtain activated carbon; b) purifying the activated carbon to obtain purified activated carbon; c) syntherizing C60 - C70 from the purified activated carbon; and d) grinding the C60 - C70 obtained in the previous step into powder of desired particle size. The invention also relates to system for producing nano carbon C60 - C70.
