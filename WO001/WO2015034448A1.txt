abstract
    The invention is essentially a combustion system with a heat recovery unit (1) wherein whole exhaust gas temperature is enabled to increase by coating piston (6), cylinder block and the cylinder head (5) with a special coating and potentially discharged energy is utilized by using a waste heat recovery unit (10) instead of discharging this increase.
