abstract
    According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a combined cycle power generating system (100) may comprise at least one genset (130A, 130B) for generating power having at least two waste heat sources; a direct organic Rankine cycle system (200) with a working medium, the direct organic Rankine cycle system comprising a modular heat rejection system (230) and an organic rankine turbine module (210, 240); wherein the modular heat rejection system comprises a common vapor separator and a boiler sub-system (234) associated to each of the at least two waste heat sources, and each boiler sub- system is configured to transfer heat of the respective waste heat source to the working medium, and the vapor separator is configured to derive a working medium gaseous phase from the working medium exiting each of the boiler sub-systems an provide the working medium gaseous phase to the organic Rankine turbine module for power generation.
