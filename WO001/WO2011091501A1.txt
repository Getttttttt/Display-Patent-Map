abstract
    An internal combustion engine powers a head pump to pump bitumen slurry from a well borehold. A storage tank stores the bitumen slurry at a location adjacent to a CHOPS site. Hot exhaust from the engine flows along an exhaust conduit and into an exhaust-to-glycol heat exchanger. The glycol is pumped in a recirculating circuit from the exhaust-to-glycol heat exchanger into and through a glycol-to-bitumen slurry heat exchanger to thereby heat the bitumen slurry in the storage tank. Cooled glycol is recirculated back through the exhaust-to-glycol heat exchanger. Engine coolant may be inter-mingled with the glycol flowing into the glycol-to-bitumen slurry heat exchanger. Alternatively, engine coolant is pumped through a second heat exchanger, an engine coolant-to-glycol in series with the exhaust-to-glycol heat exchanger, to boost the temperature of the glycol entering the slurry heat exchanger.
