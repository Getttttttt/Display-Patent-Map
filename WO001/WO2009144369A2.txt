abstract
    An oxyfuel combustion system for generating power that includes a furnace (14) for combusting carbonaceous fueland substantially pure oxygen to produce exhaust gas including mainly carbon dioxide and water. An exhaust gas channel system discharges the exhaust gas from the furnace. The exhaust gas channel system(20) has an upstream channel (54), an outlet channel (58) and a gas recycling channel (28). The upstream channel recycles a recycling portion of the exhaust gas through the recycling channel to the furnace, and conveys an end portion of the exhaust gas through the outlet channel for final processing. The upstream channel is divided between a first divider piece (46) and a connecting piece (48) into a first exhaust gas channel portion (42) and a second exhaust gas channel portion (44). A gas-gas heat exchanger (36) arranged in the first exhaust gas channel portion (42) transfers heat from exhaust gas in the first exhaust gas channel portion to gas in the gas recycling channel. A first economizer (38)arranged in the second exhaust gas channel portion(44) transfers heat from exhaust gas in the second exhaust gas channel portion (44) to a flow of feedwater in a feedwater line(40), and a second economizer (52) arranged in the exhaust gas channel system downstream of the connecting piece transfers heat from gas in the exhaust gas channel system to the flow of feedwater in the feedwater line.
