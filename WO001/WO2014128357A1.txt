abstract
    The invention relates to a method for combustion of sludge. According to the invention, wet sludge (104) is dried in a circulating mass dryer (100), dried sludge (106), is combusted in a circulating mass reactor (101), and flue gas (103) is conveyed from the circulating mass reactor to the circulating mass dryer as a heat exchange material in order to transfer heat to the sludge to be dried. In addition, the invention relates to a corresponding apparatus.
