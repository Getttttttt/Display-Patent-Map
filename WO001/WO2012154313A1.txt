abstract
    The present invention relates to systems and methods for controlling the flow of steam provided to a gas recovery unit 130 based on changes to steam flow to and/or power generated by a power generation unit 119. The gas recovery unit 130 may be part of a thermal power generation unit and may be an amine based CO2 recovery unit including two or more regenerator columns 153.
