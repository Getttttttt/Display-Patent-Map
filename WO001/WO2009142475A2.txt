abstract
    Heat recovery installation using solar energy, comprising a three- channel plate, in which the first channel layer, viewed from the outside, alternately discharges used air and supplies fresh air. The third channel layer, viewed from the outside, ensures the supply of used air and the discharge of fresh air, while in the second channel layer, viewed from the outside, the heat exchange between the used and fresh air takes place in counterflow. Small apertures are provided in the second and third plates, viewed from the outside, of the three-channel plate, as a result of which the flow in the channel layer, viewed from the outside, is at right angles to the channel plate. By making the airflow quicker than the heat flow (Pe»l), no heat can flow from the inside to the outside, except for a small loss flow through the partitions and through radiation.
