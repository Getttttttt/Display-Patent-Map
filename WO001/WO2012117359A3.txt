abstract
    The present invention relates to a device and a method for the abatement of fines, of the type PM10 and of the type PM2.5 for example, which device and method are based on the use of a fluidized bed and the slowing down of the flow velocity of a gas exhaust, exploiting the inertial characteristics of the fines in suspension.
