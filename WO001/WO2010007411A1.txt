abstract
    According to the invention there is provided a trailer with a compressor regenerative braking system including: a) a trailer (1) having wheels (2) and air brakes (5) for the wheels (2), the air brakes (5) for the wheels (2) being coupleable to an airbrake system in a lorry cab pulling the trailer, b)a compressor (6) connectable to the wheels (2) to apply a braking force to the wheels and generate compressed air, c) storage tank (10) for the compressed air, and d) a compressed air motor (11) connectable to the wheels (2) to drive the wheels (2) using air from the storage tank (10).
