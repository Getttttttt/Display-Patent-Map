abstract
    Cogeneration plant and method to operate a cogeneration plant The present invention is related to a cogeneration plant (1) comprising a gas turbine engine (10), a heat recovery steam generator (17) and a division module (21) forming a semi-closed carbon dioxide cycle (22) of the cogeneration plant (1), the cogeneration plant (1) burning a mixture of fuel (40), oxygen (41) and a recirculated first flow of combustion gas (45) in a combustor (11) of the gas turbine engine (10), the heat recovery steam generator (17) arranged downstream of the gas turbine engine (10) receiving combustion gas (44) of the gas turbine engine (10) and the division module (21) arranged downstream of the heat recovery steam generator (17) dividing the combustion gas (44) into the first flow of combustion gas (45) recirculated to the gas turbine engine (10) and a second flow of combustion gas (46) for a generation (23) of carbon dioxide (42). Further, the invention is related to a method to operate a cogeneration plant (1).
