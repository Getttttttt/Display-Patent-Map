abstract
    The invention refers to a plant and a procedure for heat and electricity production by using energy from sewerage water, especially the one resulting from industrial or housekeeping activities. The problem is solved by inventions from a group of inventions and consists in wastewater treatment simultaneously with obtaining heat and electricity. According to the invention, the installation removes the aforementioned disadvantages, because the steam from some reactor chambers is discharged through some pipelines with electric valves mounted on the inside, connected to a short collector connected with a turbine which operates a power generator, to the turbine there is connected a pipeline held in connection with a heat exchanger to which a pipeline is connected, through which the recirculation water from the first reactor chamber is introduced from a pipeline connected to the first reactor and passed through a cooler from which it is sucked by a pump and pushed through a pipe into the supply pipeline for sewerage water, to the last reactor there is connected another pipeline for the recirculation of water through another cooler from which water is pushed by another pump through another supply pipeline for the sewerage water of this reactor chamber, the boiler being connected through a pipeline to a turbine which operates a power generator, to the turbine there is connected a pipe which connects it to a heat exchanger, onto which a pipeline in communication with the boiler is mounted.
