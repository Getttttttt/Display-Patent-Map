abstract
    The present invention describes a method for treating a Zn contaminated material in a blast furnace installation comprising a blast furnace charged with a traditional burden of iron ore and coke, a gas cleaning unit, and lateral top gas extraction uptakes connected between an upper top cone of said blast furnace and said gas cleaning unit, said method comprising the following steps: a. Providing Zn contaminated material, b. Charging said Zn contaminated material in a central area of a raw material feeding zone of a blast furnace in addition to the traditional burden of iron ore and coke, c. Reducing the Zn contaminated material in the blast furnace so as to obtain a Zn enriched gas, d. Extracting a Zn enriched gas from the blast furnace, e. Treating said extracted Zn enriched gas in the gas cleaning unit.
