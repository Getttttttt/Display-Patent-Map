abstract
    A vehicle having wheels for riding the vehicle over a carrier such as a road or rails, said vehicle having a battery and a generator connected thereto, said generator being arranged to generate electrical power for charging said battery, said generator being further mechanically connected to at least one of said wheels such that said wheel drives the rotor of said generator, characterized in that said generator is an asynchronous generator or a permanent magnet generator, wherein an AC/DC inverter/charger is connected between said generator and said battery for regulating the current and the voltage of the charging power to said battery.
