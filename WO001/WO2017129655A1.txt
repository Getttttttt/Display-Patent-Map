abstract
    The present invention relates to a system for the exploitation of a bitumen produced in a hydroconversion process of heavy hydrocarbon residues, which comprises one or more boilers for burning the bitumen; one or more denitrification units for the abatement of the nitrogen oxides (DeNOx) and carbon monoxide; one or more electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) for reducing solid particulate from the denitrified gases; one or more flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units for reducing sulfur dioxide; one or more units for recovering the metals contained in the solid residues and ashes.
