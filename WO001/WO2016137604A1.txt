abstract
    High surge currents associated with heavy braking and rapid acceleration of electric and hybrid electric vehicles result in reduced battery life and excessive heating of motors, generators and electronics. These can be reduced in two ways. 1. By the use of a speed changing transmission such that the motors and generators operate at higher speeds and therefore lower currents for the same power. 2. By providing an auxiliary regenerative braking means that can handle high power levels thereby reducing the load on the electric system. This invention describes a hydraulic device that can function as a speed changing transmission and/or a regenerative braking system that can handle very high power levels. It is implemented using fixed displacement pumps and motors to achieve low cost and high reliability.
