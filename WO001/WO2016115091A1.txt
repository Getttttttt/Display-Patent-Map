abstract
    A system to generate pressurized air for hydro-excavation includes an exhaust silencer configured to hold water and an exhaust manifold disposed through the silencer, where the exhaust manifold is configured to be in fluid communication with an internal combustion engine in order to receive exhaust gases to heat the exhaust silencer. In addition, the system includes a steam turbine configured to be driven by steam generated in the exhaust silencer, a primary steam line secured proximate to an upper end of the silencer to connect to the steam turbine, and an air compressor driven by the steam turbine to generate pressurized air. A secondary steam line is in fluid communication with the primary steam line and the air compressor to generate a mixture of the steam and pressurized air for use in hydro-excavation.
