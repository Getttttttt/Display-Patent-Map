abstract
    An energy recovery apparatus (100) for an internal combustion engine (102) which comprises an exhaust outlet (110). The energy recovery apparatus (100) comprises a fluid supply means (114) arranged to supply a fluid and a piston-less rotary expander mechanism (118). The piston-less rotary expander mechanism (118) is arranged to receive exhaust gases from the exhaust outlet (110) and fluid from the fluid supply means (114). The piston-less rotary expander mechanism (118) is powered by the fluid and the exhaust gases. The fluid supplied by the fluid supply means (114) is heated by a heat source comprising at least part of the internal combustion engine (102). An internal combustion engine comprising the energy recovery apparatus is also disclosed.
