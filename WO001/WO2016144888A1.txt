abstract
    A method and system is disclosed in which an air to air heat exchanger keeps two air streams separate through the use of metal fins. Edges of alternating fins are folded so that the end is in the proximity of the adjacent fin and the remaining gap is sealed. The fin stack is held together by interlocking features or through the use of a tube, in which case the fin stacks may be stamped and stacked on alignment stakes during production using the same holes as the tubes. The heat exchanger may have extended use in removing moisture and heat from a hot humid air stream. The heat exchanger has utility in heat recovery ventilation systems, clothes dryer heat recovery or other air to air heat exchanger processes where the pressure difference between the airstreams is less than approximately 5000 Pa.
