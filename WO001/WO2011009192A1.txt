abstract
    In a conventional power generation cycle steam cannot be recycled without a condensing process and active steam momentum cannot be reused continuously. A first and any further number of pipe steamer devices (20, 22, 24, 26) are provided. Each pipe steamer device (20, 22, 24, 26) may include a ring (80, 82, 84, 86) which has a steam pipe connection opening (80a), a steam pipe (62), a water pipe (72), and a heating element (74). Each steam pipe (62) may have a proximal end which is connected to the appropriate steam pipe connection opening (80a) and a distal end which is connected to a proximal end of the appropriate water pipe (74). Each water pipe may have a distal end which is located closer to the appropriate heating element (74) than its proximal end. Each of the first steam pipe (62) and the first water pipe (72) may have a spiral shape. The apparatus also includes a fist power reinforcer device (30) which may include a first sack (30a) and a second sack (30b). The first power reinforcer device (30) may be connected to a first pipe steamer device (20) and a second pipe steamer device (22), such that steam from the first pipe steamer device (20) flows into the first sack (30a) and flows out of the first sack (30a) into the first pipe steamer device (20), and steam from the second pipe steamer device (22) flows into the second sack (30b) and out of the second sack (30b) into the second pipe steamer (22).
