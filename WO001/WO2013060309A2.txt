abstract
    The essence of the solution resides in that an internal combustion engine with rocking pistons is constituted by a shared working space in a shared housing (1) of the motor and a compressor in the central portion of which there are formed in a mirrored fashion combustion chambers (2, 2.1) containing rocking blades (3, 3.1) of the motor that are rigidly radially supported on a turnable central shaft (4) and in a carrier ring (4.1) and wherein the rocking blades (3, 3.1) are to advantage mutually angled with respect to each other and wherein the combustion chambers (2, 2.1) are delimited on the one side by delimiting partitions (5, 5.1) radially disposed at the inner circumferential surface of the shared housing (1) of the motor and the compressor and separating the combustion chambers (2, 2.1) from primary compressor chambers (6, 6.1) of the primary compressor part, and on the opposite side by a pair of rocking blades (3, 3.1) at the locations of their lower dead centers, and wherein on the opposite side of the pair of rocking blades (3, 3.1) there are formed secondary compressor chambers (7., 7.1) of a secondary compressor part delimited by end parts of a guiding segment (18) provided with secondary suction and outlet channels (19, 19.1) of a secondary compressor and wherein the turnable central shaft (4) extends with its end portions into external housings (1.1, 1.2) of a crankshaft mechanism that are connected in a mirror fashion to the shared housing (1) of the motor and the compressor, where the turnable central shaft (4) is provided with an oscillating yoke (8) having arms that are connected by means of a pair of piston rods (9, 9.1) with a pair of crankshafts (10, 10.1) on the outer ends of which there is supported a pair of flywheels (11, 11.1) that are provided on their peripheries with coils (12, 12.1) of a stator winding. A pressurized mixing chamber (17) that is connected to the outlet (28) of the exhaust gases from the rocking motor and to the outlet (29) of the pressurized air from the compressor part is provided with a main outlet (22) for the energy medium that is connected to the working expansion machine (23) that is connected with a working generator (25) of electric current, and the collection mixing chamber (17) is connected by a relief outlet (18) for the energy medium to an inlet (19) of a relief expansion machine (20) that is connected to a relief generator (21) of electric current that is electrically connected with coils (12, 12.1) of a stator winding. The combined driving system can be used primarily for the driving of generators of electric current, but its use is not limited to the driving of mobile machines and other apparatuses requiring rotary motion for their operation.
