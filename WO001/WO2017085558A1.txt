abstract
    The present invention relates to a method to initiate and manage a braking effect of a vehicle comprising an accelerator pedal, an energy providing unit, and at least one device able to provide a braking effect. The method comprises the steps of : a) detecting the foot of the driver on or above the surface of the accelerator pedal, b) determining the distance between the driver's foot and the surface of the accelerator pedal, c) following step b), generating a braking effect whose intensity depends on the distance between the driver's foot and the surface of the accelerator pedal, wherein the intensity of the braking effect is increased with an increase of the distance between the surface of the accelerator pedal and the driver's foot.
