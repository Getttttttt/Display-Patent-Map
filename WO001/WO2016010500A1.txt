abstract
    The combi boiler with heat exchanger of the present invention is mounted by two methods including O-ring and seam-welding. 1. The heat exchangers are interconnected by means of O-ring 5 gasket. 2. Two heat exchanger segments are welded from outer edges and combustion chamber edges, thereby forming a single water wall. O-ring gasket is put between each water wall segment and the number of segments is increased. Thus, combi boiler water walls and heat walls integrating with combustion chamber 10 are formed at desired values. Heat resistant O-rings provide water and gas tightness. On the other hand, water tightness is provided by seam-welding. O-ring is used for gas tightness in both methods. The heat exchanger plates are interconnected, thereby forming a water wall on one surface of the plates and heat wall on 15 the other surface. Bruner combustion chamber is formed after interconnecting the heat exchanger plates. The interconnection process is performed in such manner that heat exchanger plates placed between the heat exchanger rear integral cover and heat exchanger front integral cover are tightened with ball screw. 20 Combi boiler with heat exchanger is formed by connecting the heat exchangers. As the heat exchanger system is advanced and heat exchanger is extended, the calorific value is increased. Gas is formed by means of the combustion chamber in the middle of the heat exchanger. Thanks to the pressure applied to the heat 25 exchanger, surfaces directing the heat and water are formed. Walls are formed after the connection of the heat exchangers. Said walls consist of heat walls with one surface integrating with water and the other surface integrating with combustion chamber. Heat resistant O-rings which provide tightness of said water and heat 30 walls are used.
