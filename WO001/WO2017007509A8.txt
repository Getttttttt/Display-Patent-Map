abstract
    This invention relates to a kinetic energy recovery system under braking designed for use in any type of motor vehicle or towed vehicle to partially eliminate the need for a conventional hydraulic, pneumatic or electric conventional braking system and to recover the kinetic energy under braking for use in acceleration of the vehicle. The system includes motor hydro-pumps (A), connected to a hydraulic distributor (B), through solenoid valves (1) and a connector (210) and connected to a pneumohydraulic tank (D) by the same solenoid valves (1 ) and a connector (202). The tank (D) is connected with the distributor (B) by a connector (217), and with the pneumohydraulic cylinders (E and F), by the connectors (214, respectively 218). The distributor (B) communicates with the cylinder (E) by connector (213) and is also connected to the cylinder (F) by connector (216). A fluid-type equilibrator (G) is linked to the motor hydro-pumps (A) by connectors (204) and hydraulic accumulators ?(H), mounted on the motor hydro-pumps (A).
