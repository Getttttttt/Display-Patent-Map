abstract
    A description is given of method as well as a plant for simultaneous production of separate flows of cement clinker and supplementary cementitious material (SCM), respectively, where cement raw materials are preheated in a preheater (5), calcined in a calciner (7), burned into cement clinker in a kiln (9) and cooled in a clinker cooler (1 1 ), and where SCM raw materials are heated to a temperature of at least 500 °C subject to heat exchange with hot gases and subsequently separated from the hot gases. The method and plant are peculiar in that the hot gases separated from the heated SCM raw materials are directed into the calciner (7). It is hereby obtained that the environmental harmful gaseous species released from the SCM production process are effectively immobilised and/or destroyed in the calciner, thus eliminating the need of costly cleaning equipment. This is due to the fact that the combustible emission compounds, being organic compounds, carbon monoxide, ammonia, etc., are effectively combusted in the calciner and the acidic emission compounds, being SO2/SO3, HCI, H2S, are effectively scrubbed by reacting with the alkaline dust present in the calciner. Also, ammonium compounds and to some extent NO will be destroyed in the calciner. Furthermore, the heat of reaction released by the combustion of the emission compounds is released in the calciner and therefore fully utilised to lower the overall fuel consumption. Thus, by combining the two per se known production processes of cement clinker and SCM, respectively, in the described way, a both energy efficient and low emission process is obtained for the simultaneous production of a high quality SCM product and cement clinker.
