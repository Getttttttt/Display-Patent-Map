abstract
    The invention is related to the field of sewage sludge recovery- recycling. A metal vessel (1) is designated for loading sewage sludge, while a screw conveyor (4) is mounted for delivering it to an incineration boiler (3) in the first combustion chamber (2). A collector (9) is designated for collecting produced biogas and is connected to a supply line that supplies biogas as fuel to an internal combustion engine connected to an electricity generator (10). For the combustion of the evolved combustible gas, the main gas burner (11) is installed in the second combustion chamber (6) and an additional plasma- gas burner (13) connected with a plasma source and gas tank (14) is mounted. The combustion air is preheated.
