abstract
    The invention relates to a method for recovering heat from flue gas generated at a power plant or biomass-based plant, such as a pulp mill, and for concentrating a liquid at a multiple-effect evaporation plant having a plurality of evaporation effects, in which the heating medium and liquid flow counter-currently. Flue gas from a combustion device is directed through a channel into an indirect contact with a liquid to be concentrated, wherein the liquid is heated with heat from the flue gas in a flue gas cooler having at least one indirect heat exchange stage. The heated liquid is extracted from the flue gas cooler and flashed in at least one flashing stage so as to produce flash cooled liquid and flash vapor. The vapor is used as a heating medium in an evaporation stage or stages of the multiple-effect evaporation plant. The flash cooled liquid is circulated into the flue gas cooler.
