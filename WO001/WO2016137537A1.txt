abstract
    A waste heat recovery system may include a pump, first and second heat exchangers, an expander, and a valve. The first heat exchanger receives working fluid from the pump. The expander receives working fluid from the first heat exchanger and includes an output shaft that is powered by the flow of working fluid through the expander. The second heat exchanger may include a first fluid path and a second fluid path that is shorter than the first fluid path. The valve controls fluid flow through the first and second fluid paths. A sensor may measure a parameter of the working fluid that indicates whether the working fluid is in a gaseous state, a liquid state or a mixture of gas and liquid. A control module in communication with the sensor may control a position of the valve based on a value of the parameter measured by the sensor.
