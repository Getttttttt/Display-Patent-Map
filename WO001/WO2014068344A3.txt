abstract
    The present invention relates to the method and structural configuration for environmentally safe waste and biomass processing to increase the efficiency of energy and heat generation. In the structural configuration of the invention solid municipal and industrial waste as well as biomass are loaded and milled and afterwards they are subject to pyrolysis and gasification. The produced pyrolysis gas is cooled, cleaned and carbon dioxide is captured from it, pyrolysis gas is compressed and accumulated together with syngas and they are used for electric power and heat generation and this generated electric power and heat is supplied to external consumers. During pyrolysis and gasification, melting occurs and basalt-like slag is produced which is processed and used for production of a heat- insulation material or granulated slag, additional electric power is further generated from the heat occurred as a result of pyrolysis gas cooling. Carbon dioxide captured from exhaust gases occurred as a result of electric power and heat generation, is compressed and accumulated together with carbon dioxide recovered from pyrolysis gas, and after distribution and dosing, first, it is sent to plasma torches as plasma-forming gas, second, it is used for production of marketable products using carbon dioxide for external consumers, third, it is fed as a nutrient to cultivate algae; herewith, seed material is loaded and algae is cultivated using heat source and carbon dioxide and thus algae biodiesel and biomass production is provided. Produced biodiesel is cleaned, accumulated and used for generation of electric power and heat. Biomass extraction is returned to the beginning of the process, algae biomass and oil received as a result of liquid biofuel production are supplied to external consumers as marketable products. In addition, for the purpose of processing waste range expansion, coal dust is loaded simultaneously at the beginning of the process afterwards syngas is generated using heat then it is compressed and together with pyrolysis gas it is accumulated and used for generation of electric power and heat.
