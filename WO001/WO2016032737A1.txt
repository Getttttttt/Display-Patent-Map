abstract
    A multi-stage expansion device having bypass capabilities and a variable speed drive is disclosed. In one example, the multi-stage expansion device has a housing within which a first stage, a second stage, and a third stage are housed. The housing may also be configured with internal working fluid passageways to direct a working fluid from the first stage to the second stage and/or from the second stage to the third stage. Each of the stages may include a pair of non-contacting rotors that are mechanically connected to each other and to a power output device such that energy extracted from the working fluid is converted to mechanical work at the output device. In one example, a bypass line is provided to bypass working fluid around the first stage and a bypass line is provided to bypass working fluid around the second stage.
