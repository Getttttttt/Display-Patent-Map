abstract
    A method to increase the efficiency of a combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system includes using an organic Rankine cycle generator to exploit CCHP and cooling system waste heat. The CCHP engine waste heat is transferred to the Rankine cycle via a heat exchanger, allowing sensible heat transfer from the engine to working fluid of the Rankine cycle via either convection of combustion exhaust gas internal energy and/or conduction of heat through engine support hardware via a first heat exchanger device. The cooling subsystem of said CCHP system is a vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) cycle. The waste heat from the VCR cycle is transferred from the working fluid of the VCR cycle to the working fluid of the Rankine cycle via convection through a second heat exchanger device.
