abstract
    The present invention relates to a CHP (combined heat and power) system (1) for co-generation of heat and power from animal waste by organic Rankine Cycle comprising: a boiler (10) for combustion of animal waste, a vector fluid circuit (2), whereby the heat produced by said boiler (10) is transferred to an evaporator (20) of a work fluid circuit (3), said work fluid circuit (3) operating under organic Rankine Cycle principals, at least one induced draft fan (14) for removing flue gases of combustion from boiler (10), wherein said system (1) comprises a dryer (12) for drying of animal waste and a pelletizer (13) for homogenization of said dried animal waste wherein said dryer (12) and said pelletizer (13) are positioned in series on the path of animal waste feed and wherein said dryer (12) utilizes flue gases from boiler (10) removed by said at least one induced draft fan (14) for drying operations.
