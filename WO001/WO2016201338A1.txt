abstract
    Expander and engine start-up and shut-down control methods are disclosed. In one example, a method includes the steps of: providing an internal combustion engine which generates and exhaust flow stream and an expander which receives the exhaust flow stream to generate useful work; detecting that the internal combustion engine has been started; supplying power to a motor/generator to cause rotors within the expander to be in a static fixed position; sensing a temperature of a housing of the expander; discontinuing power to the motor/generator once the expander housing temperature sensor indicates that the housing has reached a predetermined temperature.
