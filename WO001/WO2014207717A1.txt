abstract
    This invention relates to a preheating apparatus (10) which is suitable for preheating material before it enters a furnace. The apparatus defines a cavity (12) therein for receiving the material to be preheated, which cavity (12) is defined by two opposing permeable side walls, a first permeable side wall (14) and a second permeable side wall (16) through which gas can pass from a gas inlet (18), through the material in the cavity (12) and out of the apparatus (10) via a gas outlet (20). The arrangement is such that the gas flows from the gas inlet (18) at a first inlet side (30) of the apparatus, through the first permeable wall (14), through the cavity (12), which is filled with material, through the second permeable wall (16) and out of the apparatus (10) via the gas outlet (20) at the second side (32).
