abstract
    A vehicle has a electrical machine which functions as a generator during regenerative braking or as a traction motor. Traction batteries both receive power from and supply power to the electrical machine. The vehicle has brakes which supplement braking capacity of the machine. The power source for the brakes is pneumatic which operates as an accessory using a compressor motor. Power for the compressor motor comes from the batteries or from the electrical machine. The compressor motor can operate as a power sink allowing the machine to provide braking beyond capacity of the traction batteries to absorb power by allowing the pneumatic system to discharge air to atmosphere during braking. Controls allow operation of purge valve in response to moisture conditions in air tanks and operation of compressor to charge tanks in response to compressed air usage rates or pressure levels.
