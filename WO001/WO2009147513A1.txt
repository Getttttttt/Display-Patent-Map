abstract
    The invention related to a method to produce electricity in a cement clinker production utilizing a kiln and/or a precalciner as combustion chambers to generate electricity, the method comprising: a. supplying fuel (31, 30) to the precalciner (3) and/or the kiln (5) in a quantity corresponding to at least 110% of a heat value requirement for clinker production operation of the precalciner (3) and/or the rotary kiln (5) per unit weight of clinker, respectively; b. Bypassing a portion of hot flue gases (50, 51, 52) from at least one of (i) the kiln (5) and/or (ii) the precalciner (3); c. Leading the said bypassed portion of hot flue gases to a heat recovery steam generator (7) producing steam; d. Producing electricity with a power island comprising a steam turbine equipped with an electrical generator.
