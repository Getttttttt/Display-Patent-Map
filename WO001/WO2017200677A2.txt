abstract
    The present application provides a heat exchange assembly for exchanging heat between a coolant and a gaseous medium. The heat exchange assembly may include an outer jacket, a number of gas tubes positioned within the outer jacket, and a self-cleaning system positioned about the gas tubes. The self-cleaning system may include a number of chains extending through the gas tubes.
