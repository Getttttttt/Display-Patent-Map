abstract
    An apparatus for the refrigeration of a process fluid comprising a circuit for the process fluid along which there are disposed in succession a compressor (1), a condenser (2), a first throttling device (3) and an evaporator (4) able to perform a heat exchange with a fluid to be treated, further comprises a second throttling device (5) disposed along a portion of the circulation path which connects the evaporator (4) and the compressor (1), the process fluid being selectively subjected to throttling by means of said second throttling device (5) depending on temperature values detected in two different positions (61, 62).
