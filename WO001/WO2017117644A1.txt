abstract
    Systems and methods for controlling conditions in an enclosed space can include an integral make-up air system that can be arranged in the interior of the housing for an air conditioning system that uses scavenger air in an air-to-air heat exchanger (AAHX) to condition process air from an enclosed space. The make-up air system can take replenishment air from outside the air conditioning system and deliver it into the process air stream. The make-up air system can include at least one heating or cooling device to condition the replenishment air before the replenishment air mixes with the process air. In an example, the make-up air system can include a DX coil to selectively cool and dehumidify the replenishment air. The make-up air system can include a humidifier arranged in the flow path of process air between the process air inlet and the AAHX to selectively add humidity to the process air.
