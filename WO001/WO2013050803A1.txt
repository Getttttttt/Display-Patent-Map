abstract
    A plant for co - generation of electricity and heating of water. Said plant comprises a combustion chamber (10) for combustion of biomass or of some other fuel. This plant comprises a circulating line (11) for the flue gases produced in said combustion chamber. The plant also comprises an operational circuit in which an organic fluid circulates, operating according to a Rankine cycle. The plant according to the invention further comprises a heat exchange group comprising at least one heat exchanger unit which comprises in its turn at least one first casing (31 ) that can be traversed by said combustion flue gases and at least one second casing (41), physically separate from said first casing (31 ), that can be traversed by said organic fluid. Said unit comprises a plurality of heat pipes (151, 15", 15'"), separated from one another, arranged in such a way that for each of said heat pipes (15 ', 15", 15"') a first portion (16 ') and a second portion (16") are housed respectively in said first casing (31) and in said second casing (31).
