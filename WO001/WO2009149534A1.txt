abstract
    A mobile distillation system comprising a first carriage movable through an environment, a second carriage mechanically connected to the first carriage and being mobile therewith, and a kinetic energy converter operatively connected to the mobile distillation system and being transported therewith to convert at least some of the kinetic energy of the moving distillation system into heating energy for a heater of the distillation system to thereby heat a distillable product.
