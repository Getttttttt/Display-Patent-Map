abstract
    The present invention relates to an apparatus for decarbonization of calcium carbonate into carbon dioxide rich exhaust gas comprising: • a reactor (30) for releasing the C02 by decarbonization of CaC03; • a duct (33) for forwarding the CO2 rich exhaust gas generated in the reactor for further processing; a system for recirculation of at least a portion of the CO2 rich exhaust gas generated in the reactor back into the reactor; • a firing system (10) for indirect heating of the reactor; and means for indirect heating (11). Also a system for capturing CO2 from an exhaust gas comprising a first reactor (120) wherein the carbon dioxide present in the flue gas is captured from the flue gases by carbonization; a second reactor (130) to which the solid material contained in the flue gases output from the first reactor are transferred, wherein the said solid material are subject for heat treatment in order to extract carbon dioxide therefrom by decarbonization; means (111) for indirect heating of the second reactor (130); means (150) for transferring the exhaust gas generated by the means for indirect heating of the second reactor, to the first reactor; means (133) for transporting the captured carbon dioxide for further processing.
