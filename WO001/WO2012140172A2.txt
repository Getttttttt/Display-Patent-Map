abstract
    An expander (201) is provided for converting waste energy into useful work and has a housing (202) having a pair of components (241, 242) having a fluid passageway (203) and a piston (204) continuously moving along the fluid passageway (203). The fluid passageway (203) has a periodically open inlet (205) for periodically communicating a working fluid into the fluid passageway (203) behind a portion of the piston (204). The fluid passageway (203) has an exhaust outlet (206) for communicating the spent working fluid out of the fluid passageway (203) in front of a portion of the piston (204). The expander (201) has a gate (207) disposed in the fluid passageway (203) between the exhaust outlet (206) and the periodically open inlet (205) for sealing the fluid passageway there between. The gate (207) and the piston (204) are adapted for allowing a portion of the piston (204) to pass through the gate (207).
