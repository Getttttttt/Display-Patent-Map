abstract
    A firing kiln for ceramic products, and the like, comprising at least a first channel (2) and at least a second channel (3) defined between kiln walls (1), their respective first feeding means (4a) of the products in at least said first channel (2) and second feeding means (4b) of the products in at least said second channel (3), respective firing means (5) of the same products, means of exchange (6) of hot air for sending pre-determined air flows between respective areas of the first channel (2) with areas of the second channel (3). The means of exchange (6) comprise a distribution of damper valves (22), provided with respective ports (23), designed to collect and adjust in a unidirectional manner the flow of hot air from the first end cooling area (10) to the second preheating area (13), and from the second end cooling area (15) to the first preheating area (8).
