abstract
    The present technology provides embodiments of recirculating noble gas combustion power cycles and systems including engines utilizing these power cycles. Embodiments of the cycles may include a combination of a high intake/exhaust pressure, very late or early intake valve closure, late exhaust valve opening, intake preheating using exhaust gases, sensible heat recovery, direct injection of fuel and/or oxidizer, and a condenser to remove combustion products and dissolved trace contaminant gases. An engine operating on these principles could provide motive force for electrical production, for example at power plants, or for transit, for example for ship engines. An engine operating with the cycles disclosed herein has high thermal efficiency and low cost. For example an argon power cycle using natural gas feedstock and cryogenic oxygen air separation could exceed 60% overall efficiency.
