abstract
    An energy recovery system including a device that produces a magnetic field adapted for mounting to a vehicle and a stationary conductor adapted for placing in or adjacent the path of the vehicle wherein the magnetic field induces current to flow through the conductor when the vehicle moves past the conductor. The vehicle may be an automobile, a truck, a train, or other type of vehicle. When used in conjunction with a train, the energy recovery system may be designed to recover energy from non-locomotive train cars in addition to, or in lieu of, the train locomotive. Kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost to heat energy through the application of brakes to the non-locomotive cars can thereby be recovered and re-used.
