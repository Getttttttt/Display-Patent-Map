abstract
    A passive ventilation and/ or humidity control unit for an enclosure, the unit comprising: at least one extract circuit through which extract air can be drawn from said enclosure to an extract outlet; at least one supply circuit through which supply air can be drawn into the enclosure from a supply inlet to a supply outlet; and a roof mounting component, wherein the extract outlet is adapted to facilitate a Venturi effect on said extract circuit, and wherein the (or each) supply outlet is arranged relative to said roof mounting component to dispense a supply air stream proximal to a ceiling of the enclosure to create a Coanda effect with said ceiling of said enclosure.
