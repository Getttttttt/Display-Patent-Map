abstract
    Some implementations include a magnetic energy conversion system comprising a magnet rotor assembly having one or more magnets radially spaced apart, wherein the magnet rotor assembly is configured to be attached to a driveshaft of a vehicle, and a stator assembly having one or more electrical coils, wherein the stator assembly includes a housing and one or more electrical coils, wherein the housing is configured to be placed around the driveshaft of the vehicle and around the magnet rotor assembly attached to the driveshaft so that the one or more electrical coils are in the field of the one or more magnets at least temporarily when the magnet rotor assembly rotates when the driveshaft of the vehicle turns.
