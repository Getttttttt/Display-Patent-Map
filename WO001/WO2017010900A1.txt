abstract
    The brake kinetic energy recovery system, according to the invention, consists of the motor hydraulic pumps (A and A1) which are mounted on the wheels of the vehicle, a distributor (B), of the hydraulic tanks (C and D) in connection with the air tanks (40 and 46), a pneumohydraulic cylinder (E), an oil tank (24) connected to an air tank (26), the control thereof being performed by means of the distributors (3, 3') provided with the double circuit solenoid valves (18, 19) and of the solenoid valves (28 and 29), assemblies that are connected to each other by means of the lines (16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 36 37, 39, 41, 42, 45, 48, 50, 51, 53, 54 and 55). The motor hydraulic pumps (A and A1) consist of the rotors (1), the stators (2) and the distributors (3 and 3'), the latter being coupled together, the hydraulic connection between the distributors (3 and 3') and the stators (2) being performed by the lines (16 and 17). The stator (2) and the flange (13) are provided with the circular channels (g) in connection with some radial channels (h) which are coupled with a cross channel (i), whereas any leakage of oil between the stator (2) and the rotor (1) can be disposed through the exit channel (j).
