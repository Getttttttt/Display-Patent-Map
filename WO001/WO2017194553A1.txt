abstract
    A system for regulating the viscosity of a fluid prior to atomization includes a temperature controller (14) configured to adjust a temperature of a fluid flowing in a conduit prior to atomization of the fluid by an atomizer fluidly connected to the conduit (16) and a sensor (12) in communication with the temperature controller such that the sensor can provide an indicator to the temperature controller of a viscosity of the fluid flowing in the conduit prior to atomization. An adjustment to the temperature of the fluid by the temperature controller is based at least in part on the measured viscosity indicator of the fluid, a target atomization-viscosity of the fluid, and a coking temperature of the fluid.
