abstract
    A system for ventilating at least one room in a building, comprising a first re- generative heat exchanger unit (10, 10a) and a second regenerative heat exchanger unit (10, 10b), wherein the heat exchanger units, respectively, comprises a thermal storage medium (11) and an air moving device (12) for intermittently providing, in a first direction, an exhaust airflow (13) from the at least one room to an air supply through the thermal storage medium (11), and intermittently providing, in an opposite second direction, a supply airflow (14) from the air supply to the at least one room through the thermal storage medium (11). The heat exchanger units, respectively, comprises an electronic airflow control device (15) for controlling direction of the airflow, the airflow control devices (15) being connected to a wireless network for coordinating the operation of the first and second regenerative heat exchanger units.
