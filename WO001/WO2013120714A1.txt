abstract
    A cooling system is described for the continuous cooling of sheet metal strip. The cooling system is installed downstream of a continuous oven which is drying a coating applied to the sheet metal. The cooling system is provided with means for blowing cooling air onto the sheet metal strip. The cooling system comprises -for at least part of the means for blowing cooling air onto the sheet metal strip - means for increasing the temperature of the cooling air prior to blowing the cooling air onto the sheet metal. A method is disclosed for using such cooling systems, e.g. for cooling coatings comprising magnesium oxide that are applied on grain-oriented electrical steel.
