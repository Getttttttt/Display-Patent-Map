abstract
    A fired heat exchanger module having at least one set of heat exchange elements, at least one fluid inlet stub pipe, and at least one fluid outlet stub pipe, characterised in that at its top there is a segment of the combustion chamber (2) encased in a segment of the water jacket (3) fitted with at least one fluid outlet stub pipe (4), wherein, connected to the segment of the combustion chamber (2) is at least one set (5) of the elements for the exchange of heat between the combustion gases and the fluid, at the bottom fitted with at least one fluid inlet stub pipe (6), where the chamber through which the fluid flows in each set (5) of heat exchange elements is connected to a segment of the water jacket (3). The module (1) connected to each other form a heat exchanger with a single combustion chamber, heated with a single burner.
