abstract
    A combined internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system and method for facilitating driving engagement between the internal combustion engine and the waste heat recovery system is provided. The waste heat recovery system comprises a condenser, a pump, a heat exchanger, an expansion device, a generator, and an electrical load. The heat exchanger is in fluid communication with the pump and thermal communication with an exhaust of the internal combustion engine. The expansion device is in fluid communication with the heat exchanger and the condenser. The generator is in driving engagement with the expansion device. The electrical load is in electrical communication with the generator. In response to rotation of the expansion device, an electrical current generated by the generator is applied to the electrical load to increase an efficiency of the combined internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system.
