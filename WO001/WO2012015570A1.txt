abstract
    A hydraulic system is provided with a prime mover connected to a first fixed displacement pump having a maximum flow A, a hydraulic loop connected to a system of valves and actuators, a second fixed displacement pump having a maximum flow B in fluid communication with the loop, an electric machine operable as one of a motor and a generator connected to the second pump and electrically coupled to a battery, and a controller connected to the prime mover and the electric machine. The hydraulic loop is in fluid communication with the first pump with a first check valve. The second pump is arranged in parallel with the first pump.
