abstract
    A system for controlling emissions of gas and dust during transfer of a hot feed material from a movable transfer container to a stationary feed bin of a furnace. The system includes an upper duct section which is associated with the movable transfer container, and a lower duct section associated with the feed bin. The lower duct section is attached to a main collection duct with a dust collection fan. The two duct sections are brought into close proximity with one another when the transfer container is brought into position for discharge to the feed bin, so as to form a continuous gas passage throughout the duct sections. The upper duct section includes a dust collection fitting for collecting dust and fumes in the area of the discharge opening of the transfer container, and may optionally include a dust collection fitting in the form of a pivoting hood for collecting dust and fumes in the area of the top opening of the transfer container.
