abstract
    A convection section assembly including a decliner comprising a refractory material and attached to an inner wall of the convection section assembly at an angle of 0º-90º is disclosed. The decliner is oriented to deflect hot process fluids such as flue gas away from components of the convection section such as a baffle plate, superheating lines and a superheating coil thus reducing or preventing localized overheating, deformation and/or rupture. A system and method for producing superheated steam employing the convection section are also disclosed.
