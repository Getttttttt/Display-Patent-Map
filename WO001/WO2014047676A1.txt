abstract
    A method of cooling exhaust gas of a power generation system, including the steps of: removing heat from the exhaust gas by evaporating a refrigerant of a vapour- compression refrigeration cycle system in a condenser or heat exchanger; passing the refrigerant through the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle system to remove heat from the refrigerant; and returning the cooled refrigerant to the condenser or heat exchanger, to cool the exhaust gas continuously.
