abstract
    A chassis mounted energy extraction and delivery system. In one embodiment, a gravity-referenced, external tire inflation facility is integrated into an aerodynamic fairing mounted on the chassis of a vehicle. In one other embodiment, a torsion bar coupled between a hub-mounted energy extraction or delivery facility and a selected portion of the chassis provides a cross-referenced fixed point of reference. In a dual-axle embodiment, a first end of the torsion bar is coupled to the hub of one axle and a second end of the torsion bar is coupled to the hub of the other axle. In a single-axle embodiment, the second end of the torsion bar is coupled to the chassis.
