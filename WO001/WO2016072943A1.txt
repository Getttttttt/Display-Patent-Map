abstract
    The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine (1), which basically comprises a combustion chamber (3), at least one exhaust passage (6) which enables discharge of the exhaust gas resulting in the combustion chamber (3) from the engine (1), at least one water jacket (8) which surrounds the combustion chamber (3) and through which the coolant is passed, at least one exhaust manifold (9), which is located at the end of the exhaust passage (6), and which transmits the exhaust gas to the vehicle exhaust pipe or turbocharger; and which provides saving in fuel consumption by enabling waste heat recovery by means of a gap layer (10) surrounding the exhaust manifold (9) and a nozzle (11) spraying water in the gap layer (10), and which enables to downsize both the radiator and the water circulation pump.
