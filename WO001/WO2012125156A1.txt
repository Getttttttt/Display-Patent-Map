abstract
    A cooling system for an exhaust gas recirculation assembly comprises a first exhaust gas recirculation cooler, a second exhaust gas recirculation cooler, a heat recovery turbine, a first coolant pump, a second coolant pump and a pressure regulator. The second exhaust gas recirculation cooler is upstream in the exhaust system of the first exhaust gas recirculation cooler, and receives the coolant from the first exhaust gas recirculation cooler. The heat recovery turbine is in fluid communication with coolant from the second exhaust gas recirculation cooler. The first coolant pump controls flow through the first exhaust gas recirculation cooler. The second coolant pump controls flow through the second exhaust gas recirculation cooler and the heat recovery turbine. The pressure regulator is disposed downstream of the first cooler and upstream of the second coolant pump. A portion of the coolant supplied to the second coolant pump passes through the first coolant pump.
