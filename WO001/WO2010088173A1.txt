abstract
    The disclosed system includes heat exchangers to recover and redistribute heat from and within a building heating and ventilation system and/or a steam system. Certain implementations of the system enable hybrid heating systems that merge existing combustion-based heating systems with systems that produce heat with electricity from renewable energy sources. Implementations of the disclosed system enable the conversation of energy and use of environmentally clean energy sources. In one illustrative implementation, heat is removed from an air conditioning system and redistributed into a steam generation system.
