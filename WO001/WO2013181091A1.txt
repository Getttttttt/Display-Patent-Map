abstract
    A method and system for energy recovery in a hydrogen or natural gas hybrid electric vehicle includes a turbine (20) positioned between a compressed hydrogen or natural gas storage cylinder (24) and an internal combustion engine (16). The turbine (20) receives the compressed gas from the storage cylinder (24), reduces the pressure of the compressed gas, and supplies the compressed gas at a reduced pressure to the internal combustion engine (16). The turbine is connected to a generator (22) and uses energy extracted from the pressure reduction of the compressed gas to drive the generator. The generator is further connected to a battery (14) of the hybrid electric vehicle and acts as a power source for the battery.
