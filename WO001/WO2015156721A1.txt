abstract
    The present invention relates to an arrangement in a vehicle. The arrangement comprises a hydrodynamic retarder system comprising a retarder (21) in the form of a rotor unit (21a) and a stator unit (21b), a line circuit adapted to leading a medium to and from the retarder (21) when the latter is activated, and a WHR system which comprises a line circuit, a pump (30) which pressurises and circulates a medium in the line circuit, at least one evaporator (32) in which the medium is warmed so that it becomes vaporised, a turbine (21, 36) in which the vaporised medium expands, and a condenser (34) in which the medium is cooled so that it condenses. The retarder (21) of the retarder system and the turbine (21, 36) of the WHR system are connected rotatably to a powertrain (4) of the vehicle (2) via a common motion-transmitting mechanism (22).
