abstract
    This device is an improvement on an internal combustion engine (ICE) in that the device is a hybrid of an ICE directly linked to a heat engine (HE) via an adjustable transmission to drive the power shaft for the transmission for the car, boat, generator or other equipment. The improvement provides a means of directly receiving the heat from the exhaust of the ICE and using it to power the HE which is linked via an adjustable transmission, such as a continuous variable transmission (CVT). This linkage allows the HE to use the power of the ICE to start turning until the HE has warmed up enough that it can contribute power to the ICE crank shaft, and subsequent final common power shaft for the two engines, such that it acts as a unified, hybrid motor that powers the transmission of a truck, generator or other equipment.
