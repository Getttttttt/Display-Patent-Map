abstract
    A hydraulic regenerative braking system for passenger stock and freight wagons is conceived and described. This invention provides a precisely controlled hydraulic regenerative braking system for a railway vehicle, which utilizes the current pneumatic control system in the locomotive to control the hydraulic energy regenerating system. The pressure from the triple valve of the rolling stocks is controlled by the loco pilot. The operation of pressure control and flow control valves in the control valve block is so that the hydraulic pump in the regenerative system generates the pressure in the hydraulic system thereby reducing the kinetic energy of the train. The torque required to pressurize the system acts as the braking torque. The pressurized fluid is stored in accumulators. This stored energy is used when the train starts and initial torque to be generated by the locomotive is minimized. All the axles are given the feed from the hydraulic pump operated by the pressurized fluid from the accumulators.
