abstract
    The vehicle (1) comprises: - a chassis (2) having an average plane (P) which is substantially horizontal when the vehicle is on a substantially horizontal ground; - an internal combustion engine (4) and an exhaust line (12) collecting exhaust gases from said engine; - a Rankine system (13), comprising a tank (15) for a working fluid, said working fluid flowing in a loop and being successively evaporated in a heat exchanger (16) by heat exchange with the exhaust gases, expanded in an expander (17), condensed in a condenser (18) and compressed in a pump (19). With respect to a direction (Z) that is substantially orthogonal to the chassis average plane (P), the condenser (18) is installed higher than the tank (15), and the tank (15) is installed higher than the pump (19).
