abstract
    A power generation system (2) having a first heat exchanger (18), a second heat exchanger (20), a third heat exchanger (22) and a fourth heat exchanger (24) for transferring or receiving heat to an ambient air (8) entering a gas turbine system (4) according to climate conditions. The first heat exchanger (18) is included to transfer heat from a working fluid (26) to said ambient air (8) entering said gas turbine inlet (6). The second heat exchanger (20) is included for transferring heat to the working fluid (26) from a fluid (28) received downstream of said heat recovery steam generator unit (10), said second heat exchanger (20) being connected to the first heat exchanger (18) by a first flow path (30) of the working fluid (26). The third exchanger (22) is included for transferring heat to the working fluid (26) from said process cooling fluid (14), said third heat exchanger (22) being connected to said second heat exchanger (20) by a second flow path (32) of the working fluid (26) and further connected to the first heat exchanger (18) by a third flow path (34) of the working fluid (26), wherein said first (30), second (32) and third (34) flow paths define a first circulation path (38) of the working fluid (26). The fourth heat exchanger (24) is included to connect to said first heat exchanger (18) through a fourth flow path (36) and to connect to said third flow path (34) to define a second circulation path (56) in parallel to said first circulation path (38), and to cool said working fluid (26) by transferring heat from said working fluid (26) to a exchanger cooling fluid (46) received from one of an absorption chiller (48) that is fed with a steam output (50) from the steam turbine (44), or a forwarding district cooling line (52) that is supplied with a cool fluid (54) cooled by said absorption chiller (48).
