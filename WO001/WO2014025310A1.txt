abstract
    The present invention provides a cooling system for cooling an airflow using a cooling device, a method for cooling the airflow using the cooling system and a method for cooling the airflow using the cooling device, the cooling system having a dehydrating section for dehydrating the airflow, a hydrating section for hydrating another airflow, and the cooling device for cooling the airflow, the cooling device is in fluid communication with the hydrating section and dehydrating section such that at least a portion of the airflow is channeled into the cooling device and the cooled airflow is channeled into the hydrating section thus forming a fluid loop, the cooled portion is used to cool the airflow in the hydrating section, the cooling device having a dehumidifying section for receiving and dehumidifying the airflow, a plurality of humidifying cells having a moisture content whereby each humidifying cell is in fluid and thermal communication with the dehumidifying section and designed to cool the airflow when the airflow is flowing through the plurality of humidifying cells, each humidifying cell designed to receive at least a portion of the airflow and humidify the portion of airflow when the moisture vaporizes into the airflow and each humidifying cell being thermally insulated from each other such that the plurality of humidifying cells are cooled during the humidification of the portions of airflow and thereby cooling the airflow in the dehumidifying section prior to entering the plurality of humidifying cells.
