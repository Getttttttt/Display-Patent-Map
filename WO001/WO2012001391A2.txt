abstract
    A steam turbine system is described comprising fluidly in series: at least one high pressure turbine and/ or at least one intermediate pressure turbine and at least one low pressure turbine; and further comprising steam outlet means to enable extraction of auxiliary process steam from a location upstream of the low pressure turbine and for example between the intermediate pressure turbine and the low pressure turbine; and at least one flow restrictor in a steam extraction conduit from the or each low pressure turbine. The system is described as part of a steam generator fuelled by carbonaceous fuel combustion with post combustion carbon capture capability.
