abstract
    A heat exchange unit for hot gas heat recovery comprising: a heat exchange duct housing a heat exchange array; a bypass duct; an arrangement configured to cause variable amounts of hot gas to flow through the bypass duct and the heat exchange duct; and a barrier intermediate the heat exchange duct and bypass duct and including a cavity through which a fluid may be introduced so as to extract heat that would otherwise transfer from the bypass duct to the heat exchange duct and/or vice versa.
