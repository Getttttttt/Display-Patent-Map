abstract
    A regenerative braking system for a vehicle (10) includes a control module (12) that receives one or more signals based on a vehicle environment and that generates a set speed and a control signal based on the one or more signals. The control signal represents a motoring mode and a generating mode. A motor control module (20) controls bidirectional current flow between an electric motor (14) and a battery (22) based on the control signal. The motor control (20) module controls the direction and magnitude of the current flow based on the control signal and the electric motor (14) provides a decelerating load that slows an actual speed of the vehicle (10) to the set speed.
