abstract
    The system (100) is associated to an engine (M), in which, in predetermined use conditions, at least a cylinder (C2) functions permanently in a combustion regime, while at least a remaining bivalent cylinder (C1) is converted to a steam functioning cycle, preventing both air and fuel from inflow, and injecting steam produced by a plant (3) in phase relation with the compression run of the relative piston (11). The system is managed by electronic organs (60) which interface with the electronic control boards of the engine (M) and provides both for activation and for automatic exclusion of the system (100), respectively when the following above predetermined use conditions occur, or not; in the mentioned conditions, the use of the system (100) reduces the consumption and pollutant emissions of the engine.
