abstract
    A method of operating a drive train (210) for a hybrid electric vehicle, in which the drive train (210) comprises an internal combustion engine (220), an electrical machine (230) and electrical energy storage means (250). The electrical machine (230) is connected to supply electrical energy to and receive electrical energy from the electrical energy storage means (250). The internal combustion engine (220) is drivingly coupled to a first one of the sun, planet and annulus gears of an epicyclic gear arrangement (225). The electrical machine (230) is drivingly coupled to a second one of the sun, planet and annulus gears. The third one of the sun, planet and annulus gears driving coupled for driving wheels (280) of a hybrid electric vehicle. The method comprises the steps of sensing a parameter indicative of the voltage across the electrical energy storage means (250) and, in response to this sensed parameter, controlling the internal combustion engine (220) and/or the electrical machine (230) such that the first electrical machine (230) operates to give rise to a voltage output of the first electrical machine (230) such that the electrical energy storage means (250) is charged without the need for power electronics.
