abstract
    A fine dust removal system for a rotary lime kiln includes a preheater adjacent the charging end of the kiln and a housing adjacent to and communicating with kiln charging end, such that a major portion of not off-gases containing solid particulates are diverted to the preheater and a minor portion thereof directed into the housing. At least a portion of the solid particulates is separated from the hot off-gases in the housing, while the hot off-gases leaving the housing, after solid particulate removal, are directed into the preheater.
