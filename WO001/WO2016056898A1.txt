abstract
    The air-conditioning system comprises a dehumidification module and a regeneration module, that are arranged such that a first flow of liquid desiccant material may run in a cycle between those. The system also comprises a first container for the liquid desiccant material for supply into the dehumidifier module. Furthermore, the system is provided with a second regeneration module for generation of a second flow of liquid desiccant material and a second container for storage of desiccant material with an entry for the dehumidified second flow. It further comprises mixing means for mixing desiccant material from the second container into the first container and/or with the first flow upstream of the dehumidifier module. Particularly, the second flow is heated prior to regeneration by means of a heat-exchanger drawing heat â€“ directly or indirectly - from a cooling liquid of a fuel-driven generator
