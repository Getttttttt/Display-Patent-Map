abstract
    A transmission for a motor vehicle is provided. The transmission is a plurality of switches that reconfigurably interconnects constrained energy sources through switch settings. In one embodiment, the energy sources are batteries or fuel cells for an electric or hybrid motor vehicle. The transmission is in communication with a controller that receives energy from the plurality of energy sources and regulates output energy. In one embodiment the controller is a pulse width modulation controller and may also be an inverter and/or converter. A device for converting the output energy of the controller into one of a force or a rate is provided. In one embodiment the device is an electric motor.
