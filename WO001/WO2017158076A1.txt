abstract
    The present invention relates to a cement kiln tertiary air duct damper unit (1) for a tertiary air duct (3) between a clinker cooler and a calciner of a clinker kiln line comprising at least one flow restrictor (2) which can be inserted into the tertiary air duct (3) to at least partially limit the tertiary air flow in the tertiary air duct by reduction of the cross section of the tertiary air duct. The damper unit comprises a control device (4) attached to said flow restrictor (2) for insertion and retraction of said flow restrictor (2) in and from the tertiary air duct (3), a damper unit housing (5) for housing the flow restrictor (2) in a retracted position comprising at least one control device opening (6) through which the control device (4) may be attached to the flow restrictor (2) such that the flow restrictor (2) may be operated from outside the damper unit housing (5), and the at least one control device opening (6) comprises a sealing device (7) for sealing a gap between the control device opening (6) and the control device (4) such that the inside of the tertiary air duct (3) is sealed from the outside surroundings of the tertiary air duct (3) through the damper unit housing (5) and wherein the control device (4) comprises means for internal cooling of the control device.
