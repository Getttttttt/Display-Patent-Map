abstract
    A method (300) for controlling the regenerative braking torque of a vehicle (100), the vehicle (100) comprising at least one first axle on which at least one first moving member (R1) of the vehicle (100) is mounted and at least one second axle on which at least one second moving member (R2) of the vehicle (100) is mounted, the vehicle (100) further comprising a braking system (200) comprising a first plurality of components (201) operatively associated with said at least one first axle and a second plurality of components (201) operatively associated with said at least one second axle, the vehicle (100) comprising at least one traction and regenerative braking supply module (203) configured to provide the regenerative braking torque to one or more regenerative braking torque actuation modules with which the vehicle (100) is provided, the vehicle (100) further comprising a battery module (2) and at least one data processing unit (204) operatively connected to said at least one traction and regenerative braking supply module (203), to the first plurality of components (201) of the braking system (200), to the second plurality of components (202) of the braking system (200). The method (300) comprises steps of: detecting (301), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a first information representing a deceleration request of the vehicle (100); detecting (302), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a second information representing a speed of at least one of the vehicle (100), the first moving member (R1) of the vehicle (100) and the second moving member (R2) of the vehicle (100); determining (303), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a first temperature value of at least one component of the first plurality of components (201 ) of the braking system (200) operatively associated with said at least one first axle; determining (304), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a second temperature value of at least one component of the second plurality of components (202) of the braking system (200) operatively associated with said at least one second axle; determining (305), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a third information representing the state of at least one of the battery module (205) and said at least one traction and regenerative braking supply module (203); determining (306), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a regenerative braking power dynamic distribution ratio between the first axle and the second axle on the basis of the first information, of the first temperature value and of the second temperature value; determining (307), by the at least one data processing unit (204), a first regenerative braking torque value to be applied to the first axle and a second regenerative braking torque value to be applied to the second axle on the basis of the determined regenerative braking power dynamic distribution ratio, of the second information and of the third information; providing (308), by the at least one data processing unit (204), the first regenerative braking torque value and the second regenerative braking torque value to said at least one traction and regenerative braking supply module (203).
