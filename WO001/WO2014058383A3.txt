abstract
    The present invention proposes a method and a system for identification of cost-free energy and utilisation of said cost-free energy in at least one vehicle-borne system. The method comprises simulation of at least one future speed profile v sim  along a section of road ahead of a vehicle on the basis of information related to the section of road. The method comprises identification, on the basis of at least one future speed profile v sim , of whether cost-free energy will be available for the vehicle along the section of road. Available cost-free energy is defined here as surplus energy which the vehicle has during a simulated period of rolling roll Sim  and during a simulated active braking process brake Sim  if the simulated period of rolling roll Sim  is followed by the simulated braking process brake Sim . The method comprises also utilisation of this available cost-free energy for replenishment of at least one energy store in at least one vehicle-borne system which obtains energy from a power train of the vehicle.
