abstract
    The invention relates to an incineration plant comprising a furnace (1) including movable grates (14, 18, 20) on which fuel is burned. Flue gases are directed through at least a first and a second vertically extending radiation passes (80, 81, 82) and subsequently through a number of convection passes (83, 84). A first superheater (30) is arranged in one of the convection passes. A second superheater (87, 87a, 87b) com- prises an inner metal pipe (36), through which the steam is flowing and an outer metal casing (38) enclosing the inner metal pipe (36), There is provided a spacing (50) between the inner metal pipe and the outer metal casing. The second superheater is arranged for further heating of steam heated In the first superheater and Is arranged in at least one of: the furnace, the first vertically extending radiation pass (80) and the second vertically extending radiation pass (81).
