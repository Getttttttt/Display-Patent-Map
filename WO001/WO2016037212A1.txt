abstract
    An assembly (10) that receives a fuel (11) by the first fuel delivery system, that may be a low grade fuel such as biomass, garbage, coal and heavy bunker fuel oils. A turbine (12) is used, with hot gases moving the turbine being employed for heating a kiln (21). Combustion gases (26), are also used to provide a combustable gas for an augmentation chamber (39).
