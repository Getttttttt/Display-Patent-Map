abstract
    Biomass or refuse-derived fuels (10) and seawater or other non-potable water are used as an input to a combustor/evaporator (15, 20). The resulting steam heats a working fluid in an Organic Rankine Cycle (30, 50, 60, 75) process which drives a turbine (50) to produce mechanical rotation. This rotation can be used to directly drive a process or to generate electricity. The heating of the working fluid cools the steam to produce purified water. The evaporator provides a water purification process for both the separation of dissolved components as well as providing for thermal pasteurization / sterilization. Suitable water inputs are seawater, brackish water and water with those waterborne diseases and pathogens which can be killed through pasteurization/sterilization.
