abstract
    The present subject matter relates to a two or multiple wheeler EV or EHV having one or more rechargeable energy storage banks. Each of the power bank is connected to a drive motor and charging generator and regenerative system with one or more flexible braided conductive cable. Certain modules like IBMS+IMS+BM&CS are connected through a Snap Connector mounted normally below the flooring of the vehicle on the chassis. The power banks are generally designed to slide in or slide out with the help of a special mechanism.
