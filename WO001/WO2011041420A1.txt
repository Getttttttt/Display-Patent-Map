abstract
    A method for producing metallic iron including providing a hearth furnace having an entry end and a discharge end, a moveable hearth, and an exhaust stack positioned toward the entry end of the furnace, providing a carbonaceous hearth layer above the hearth, providing a layer of reducible material comprising reducing material and iron bearing material, delivering a flow of gases into the hearth furnace through burners, gas injection ports, or a combination thereof directing a flow of gases toward the entry end selected from combustible fuel, oxygen and carbon dioxide, oxygen and flue gas, oxygen and air, or a combination thereof to heat the furnace to a temperature sufficient to at least partially reduce the reducible material, increasing the velocity of the flow of gas to greater than 4 feet per second along the furnace, and heating the layer of reducible material to at least partially reduce the reducible material.
