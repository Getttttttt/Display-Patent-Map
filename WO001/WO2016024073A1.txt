abstract
    A wind tower for a building, a building, and a method of operating a wind tower for a building. The wind tower includes an opening for allowing air to enter and exit the tower and a duct for allowing air to flow between an interior of the building and the opening. The wind tower further includes a rotatable member positioned in the wind tower to condition a flow of air in the duct. A further method includes retrofitting an existing wind tower with a rotatable member.
