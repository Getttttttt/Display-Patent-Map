abstract
    A step-up voltage converter of an electric vehicle includes a reactor having one end connected to a low voltage-side positive electrode terminal of the voltage converter and the other end connected to a high voltage-side positive electrode terminal, and a step-up switching element connected between a high voltage side of the reactor and a common negative electrode line connecting low-voltage side and high voltage-side negative electrode terminals of the voltage converter. The electric vehicle includes an interrupter isolating the step-up switching element from a circuit of the voltage converter when the step-up switching element has a short-circuit fault. Once the interrupter is activated, a short circuit between the positive and negative electrode terminals of the voltage converter is cancelled, and the voltage converter serves as a mere conducting path that directly couples the low voltage-side terminals to the high voltage-side terminals, so the vehicle is able to continue travelling.
