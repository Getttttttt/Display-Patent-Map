abstract
    The counterflow cylindrical recuperative heat exchanger (1) features: the inlets (11) of the medium are arranged radially, possibly semi-radially on the end annular distributor (17) and radially with regard to the longitudinal axis (4) of the recuperative heat exchanger (1), and follow up to the inlet channels (9) arranged between the external pipe (2) and the internal pipe (3) for the flow of the medium. The recuperative heat exchanger (1) features the outlets (12) of the medium, which are arranged axially on the end annular distributor (17) and radially with regard to the longitudinal axis (4) of the recuperative heat exchanger (1), and follow up to the outlet channels (10) for the flow of the medium. The heat-exchanger surfaces (5) are mutually separated, coaxial, multithread screw-like coiled, situated between the external pipe (2) and the internal pipe (3) and outline the mutually separated inlet channels (9) and outlet channels (10) for the flow of the medium. The heat-exchanger surfaces (5), and therefore also the inlet Channels (9) and outlet channels (10) are arranged radially around the longitudinal axis (4) of the recuperative heat exchanger (1). The heat-exchanger surfaces' feature a shape of the area arising through the drawing of the forming profile (8, 16) along the external helices (6) and internal helices (7), where the profile (8, 16) has one shape, in the transverse section perpendicular' to the longitudinal axis (4) of the recuperative heat exchanger (1), from the group including parts of the straight line, circle, helix, involute, parabola and hyperbola.
