abstract
    The invention relates to a power generation system which comprises at least one gas turbine having an air intake and an exhaust system, a heat recovery steam generator having a duct burner, the heat recovery steam generator being supplied with exhaust gas from the exhaust system of the at least one gas turbine, a mine drain gas supply unit for supplying mine drain gas to the duct burner and a steam turbine driven by steam generated in the heat recovery steam generator. The power generation system may further include a vent air methane supply unit for supplying vent air methane to the air intake of the at least one gas turbine.
