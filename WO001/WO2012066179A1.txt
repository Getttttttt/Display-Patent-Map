abstract
    The invention concerns a method and furnace for the incineration of solid material in a furnace, in which method the fuel is supplied to the grate (11) of the chamber (10) of the furnace (1) to be incinerated and the flue gases are cycled to be re-incinerated. According to the invention, the flue gases are led from the chamber (10) through the cell structure (9a) located in the core (9) of the furnace (1) either for re-incineration or into the collection tank (2) for combustion residues.
