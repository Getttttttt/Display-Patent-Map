abstract
    A vehicle, such as an automobile, is provided with friction (1) and regenerative (3,4,5) braking systems. A sensor (15) detects an obstacle in the vehicle's path and a brake controller (5), when operated by a user, automatically deploys either or both braking systems to decelerate the vehicle so that its speed corresponds to that of the obstacle when the vehicle is a predetermined distance from the obstacle. The brake controller is arranged to deploy the braking systems in order to optimise recovery of kinetic energy by the regenerative braking system. The brake controller may be operated in a standard mode, in which it deploys the braking systems to provide a retarding force on the vehicle which depends on a driver's input. The brake controller may be controlled by a brake pedal (9). The pedal may have a position part way along its travel at which resistance to further travel temporarily increases and operation of the pedal beyond that position causes the brake controller to operate in the standard mode.
