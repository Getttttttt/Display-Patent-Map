abstract
    In a method for recovering energy from damp exhaust gases, in which exhaust gas having a temperature from 90-130 °C and a water dew point from 50-75°C is first cooled to a temperature above the dew point in an indirect, first heat exchanger (3) and the cooled exhaust gas is then passed through a direct contact condenser (2), the condensate (6) that is formed in the direct contact condenser (2) is collected and heated in the first heat exchanger (3) by heat exchange with the exhaust gas.
