abstract
    In one aspect, the present invention provides a biomass gasifier comprising a reactor. The reactor includes (i) an inlet for biomass, (ii) an inlet for an oxygen - containing gas, (iii) an inlet for steam, (iv) an outlet for reactor product gas, (v) an outlet for ash, (vi) a biogas exit conduit coupled to the outlet for the reactor product gas and (vii) an inlet for a secondary oxygen source. The biogas exit conduit includes a catalytic partial oxidation unit, the catalytic partial oxidation unit is substantially restricting the biogas exit conduit. A system and method for biomass gasification is also provided.
