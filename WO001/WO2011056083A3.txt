abstract
    The present invention concerns a mobile device for rendering harmless organic waste, particularly medical, catering and veterinary waste, including harmful waste, to be used to render the waste harmless by means of the process of carbonization directly in the vicinity of its production. A mobile device for rendering harmless organic waste, particularly medical, catering and veterinary waste, having at least two chambers and devices to recover heat, according to the invention is characterized in that it constitutes a carbonization reactor (8) unit connected at its outlet to an exhaust gases after-burning reactor (15), placed in a mobile container (1) and having microwave generators as its heating devices.
