abstract
    A number of variations may include a thermal management system comprising: an engine, an exhaust heat recovery system, and a coolant system comprising a coolant circuit and a coolant pump wherein the coolant pump operates independently of the engine and is operated by an electronic control unit, and wherein the electronic control unit is constructed and arranged to operate the coolant pump after engine start up to limit coolant temperature below a predetermined value in and/or near the exhaust heat recovery system.
