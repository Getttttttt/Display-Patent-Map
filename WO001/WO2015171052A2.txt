abstract
    A ventilation device (10) for exchanging room air, comprising a casing (15) having an internal wall (22) dividing the casing (15) into a first compartment (23) and a second compartment (24), each of said compartments (23, 24) having a first opening (25a, 25b) and a second opening (26a, 26b), wherein the ventilation device further comprises a first heat exchanger (11a) arranged in the first compartment, a second heat exchanger (11b) arranged in the second compartment, a first fan (12a) arranged in the first compartment and a second fan (12b) arranged in the second compartment, said fans being arranged for alternatingly providing, in a first direction, an exhaust airflow (13) from the room to an air supply through the heat exchangers, and alternatingly providing, in an opposite second direction, a supply airflow (14) from the air supply to the room through the heat exchangers.
