abstract
    A method of operating a channel induction furnace to process a feed material and obtain therefrom at least one of a molten metal product, a vapor phase metal product and a slag product. A molten metal bath is maintained in the channel induction furnace and the method includes adding a reductant such as carbon or a carbon containing material directly into the molten metal bath independently of the feed material.
