abstract
    The invention comprises a boiler system which is fuelled by biochips and has a fuel store (1, 3), a fuel feeder (2, 4) connected to the fuel store (1, 3), a combustion unit (5) connected downstream of the fuel feeder (2, 4), a heat exchanger (6, 7) connected downstream of the combustion unit (5), an exhaust pipe (8, 9) connected downstream of the heat exchanger (6, 7), and pipelines (12) connecting the various units. The essence of the invention is that the boiler system has two separate fuel stores (1, 3), both of which have a dedicated fuel feeder (2, 4). The first fuel feeder (1 ) is designed for herbaceous and/or fine chip fuels, while the second fuel feeder (3) is designed for ligneous fuels. A further essence of the invention is that it has two different heat exchangers (6, 7) designed to support two separate functions. A further essence of the invention is that has a heightened fuel store (1, 3) which in a preferred embodiment has a legged (15) baseplate (16) and is bounded by sidewalls (17, 18, 19) and is also equipped with a dryer (5). Furthermore, combining the above, the essence of the invention is that the boiler system has two separate fuel stores (1, 3), both of which have a dedicated fuel feeder (2, 4), the first fuel feeder (2) being designed for herbaceous and/or fine chip fuels and the second fuel feeder (4) for ligneous fuels, and has two heat exchangers (6, 7) supporting two different functions, as well as, has a heightened first fuel store (1 ), and is also equipped with a dryer (10) with a heat pipes (14) located underneath the baseplate of the fuel store (1 ), and the inlet of the heat pipes (14) is connected to the exhaust pipes (8, 9) of the boiler system. Furthermore, the invention is a boiler system with a combustion unit (5) designed to enable the controlled recirculation of flue gases into its combustion chamber so that the temperature of the firebed can be controlled, and its grate has a mobile design.
