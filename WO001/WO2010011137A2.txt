abstract
    A device for treating organic material at increased process temperature comprises: a reactor (1) with a feed for material (3) for treating, a first discharge (4) for treated material and a second discharge (8) for combustible gas resulting from the treatment; and a combustion chamber (2) in which the combustible gas is combusted with oxygen (5), for instance with air, with a discharge for the resulting flue gas (7). According to the invention the device comprises temperature adjusting means, for instance mixing means for mixing this flue gas with cooling air (6) for the purpose of obtaining heating gas; and heating means for heating the wall of the reactor, and thereby also the material present therein, with the heating gas; such that the process in the reactor, after an initial heating with external energy, takes place autothermally.
