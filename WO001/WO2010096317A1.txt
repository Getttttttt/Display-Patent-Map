abstract
    A method for estimating power capability of a power source driving an electrical load can include obtaining initial values of power source parameters including a voltage value and a current value while preventing the power source from causing kinetic energy to be produced in the electrical load. The method can also include estimating power capability of the power source based on the initial values of the power source parameters.
