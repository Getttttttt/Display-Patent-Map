abstract
    An energy storage system is described comprising a closed gas circuit which comprises an expansion chamber 2, a compression chamber 3 coupled to the expansion chamber, a compressor for compressing gas from the expansion chamber as it is delivered to the compression chamber, a turbine 5a for recovering energy stored by the gas in the compression chamber as the gas is released back into the expansion chamber and a generator coupled to the turbine 5b for generating electrical energy from the recovered energy. The compression chamber is located within the expansion chamber, so that heat generated as the gas is compressed is conducted through the wall of the compression chamber and into the expansion chamber directly. The system can be powered by solar energy or other form of renewable energy, with the energy being stored where it is produced and where the electrical energy is to be consumed.
