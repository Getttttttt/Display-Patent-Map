abstract
    A fluid heater (1) including a chamber (2), a heating means (3), at least one heat exchanger (4), and a fluid inlet (9). The heating means (3) is disposed within the chamber (2). The at least one heat exchanger (4) is mounted within the chamber (2) below the heating means (3). The fluid inlet (9) supplies fluid to said at least one heat exchanger (4). The fluid heater (1) also includes a means (11) for drawing heat downwardly from the heating means (3) for heat exchange with the at least one heat exchanger (4) to heat the fluid within the at least one heat exchanger (4).
