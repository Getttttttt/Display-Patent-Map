abstract
    An air cooling system consisting of several different known technologies brought together in combination to provide a complete cooling process. The invention may consist of several parallel and series stages in combination where each stage comprises an adiabatic stage which feeds a conventional heat exchanger. The conventional exchange of heat within the heat exchanger is assisted by an evaporation process where the water for the evaporation is supplied from water jets contained in the adiabatic stage and these jets are adjusted so that the water pressure is higher than is required for the adiabatic zone alone.
