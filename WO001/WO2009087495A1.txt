abstract
    The object of the invention is a water supply system for high-rise and particularly high-rise buildings located in the regions of hot climate. The water in the said system is uplifted to the top of the building in the form of steam (3) by means of steam uplifting shafts (2). The water in the system is evaporated in the basins (1), located at the bottom of the building, or in vaporizers, using solar (4) energy or the energy released in exothermic reactions and is directed to the steam uplifting shafts (2) with the constant steam (2) temperature being maintained throughout the entire building height. At the top of the building steam is condensed and collected in the distribution tank. The system is arranged to produce electricity by using the uplifted surplus water, as well as to create artificial rain.
