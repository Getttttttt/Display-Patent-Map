abstract
    Multi-hearth roasters or kilns in metal recycling processes to clean and prepare metal scrap for melt down or other recycling processes. Multi-hearth roasters include multiple heating zones that may be held at different temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric compositions to allow for different heating conditions of the scrap material as it passes through the multi-hearth roaster. The staged heating allows contaminants to be burned, vaporized or decomposed in a controlled manner that results in greater process efficiency and enhanced safety due to decreased risk of fire or explosion.
