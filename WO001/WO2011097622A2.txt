abstract
    A system and method for generating power, comprises providing a fuel stream and an oxygen stream to a magnetohydrodynamic generator so as to generate electric power and a first exhaust stream comprising CO2 and water; and providing the first exhaust stream to an expansion generator so as to generate electric power and a second exhaust stream comprising CO2 and water at a lower temperature and pressure than the first exhaust steam. The system and method may include the step of separating air upstream of the magnetohydrodynamic generator so as to generate the oxygen stream and may include the step of condensing the second exhaust stream so as to generate water and a wet CO2 stream. The wet CO2 stream may be condensed so as to generate water and a dry CO2 stream, which may be stored underground.
