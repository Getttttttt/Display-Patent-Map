abstract
    The invention relates to a method for recovering heat from flue gas and to a steam power plant. In the method, combustion air is preheated in a flue gas LUVO (10) by means of flue gases (FH) exiting a boiler (11) and feed water (W) entering the boiler (11) is preheated by means of steams bled from a steam turbine. A part of heated air (AH) having passed through the flue gas LUVO (10) is conveyed as recirculated air (AR) within preheated air (Ac) to be fed to the flue gas LUVO (10) and recirculated air (AR) is controlled to pass via at least one recirculated-air heat exchanger (8a, 8b), in which recirculated-air heat exchanger (8a, 8b) recirculated air (AR) is cooled by means of feed water entering the boiler.
