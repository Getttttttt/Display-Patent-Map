abstract
    When cooling acid which is withdrawn from an absorption apparatus of a sulfuric acid plant, the acid is pumped from an acid pump tank into a heat exchanger and subsequently again supplied to the absorption apparatus, wherein water as heat transport medium is heated in the heat exchanger with the heat of the acid and is at least partly converted into steam, and wherein the water is separated from the steam. It is provided that the acid is supplied to a shell space of the heat exchanger and the water is supplied to heat transfer elements arranged in the shell space and at least partly converted into steam, that the steam generated in the heat exchanger is separated from water in a steam drum, and that the water thus obtained is recirculated to the heat exchanger by means of a pump.
