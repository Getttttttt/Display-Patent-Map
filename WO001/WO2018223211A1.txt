abstract
    A controllable steam CO2 unit (CSCU) for generating steam and CO2 simultaneously within a combustion chamber is invented. High pressure fuel and high pressure oxidant are injected into the chamber for combustion. Meanwhile, high pressure water is injected into the spiral flow cooling annulus. The water reduces the temperature of the combustion chamber and absorbs the combustion heat. Eventually the water is sprayed into the chamber from star-shaped ports and then evaporates. The final products include steam, CO2, N2, and some liquid water, which are directly injected into a heavy oil reservoir. The CO2 can dissolve into heavy oil to reduce oil viscosity. The fuel can be diesel or natural gas or other option. The injected oxidant can be air or oxygen-enriched gases. CSCU operation is based on a programmable logic controller (PLC). The CSCU has high heat efficiency, low operating cost, and no surface greenhouse gas emissions.
