abstract
    Provided are a waste incinerator and a cogeneration system using the same that are capable of smoothly incinerating various incinerable municipal and industrial wastes, and producing electric power and providing heating and warm water using heat generated during incineration of the wastes. The waste incinerator includes: a housing having a structure in which a triple iron plate is constituted by an inner wall, an intermediate wall and an outer wall to define an incineration chamber having a certain volume by surrounding side and upper parts of the incineration chamber, the upper part has a waste input port, and an empty space between the inner wall and the intermediate wall is filled with water to be used as heating water; a heating chamber installed under the incineration chamber to provide a certain volume and configured to heat the bottom of the incineration chamber using a burner installed at one side thereof to maintain the temperature in the incineration chamber at a predetermined level; an exhaust gas discharge port having a lower end vertically installed at a center part of the incineration chamber to be connected to the heating chamber, and a lower section in communication with a center lower part of the in¬ cineration chamber to guide discharge of a combustion gas generated in the incineration chamber and the heating chamber to the exterior; a steam generation chamber having a double-cylinder structure surrounding an outer periphery of the exhaust gas discharge port, and filled with water for receiving heat from the incineration chamber to generate steam; a first air supply means installed at an inner lower part of the incineration chamber and, and having an air supply pipe and a first blower installed at an outer end of the air supply pipe, wherein the air supply pipe has a plurality of small holes passing therethrough from the exterior of the housing toward the inner lower part of the incineration chamber to supply air required for combustion of waste; a second air supply means having a plurality of air passages installed around the housing surrounding the incineration chamber to supply air required for combustion of waste and disposed between the inner wall and the intermediate wall at predetermined intervals, and a second blower installed to forcedly supply air toward a space between the intermediate wall and the outer wall; a rotary rotatably installed to cross the incineration chamber to stir the waste input into the incineration chamber; an initial ignition burner installed at one side of the housing and initially igniting the waste input into the incineration chamber; and a residue discharge screw installed at the bottom of the incineration chamber to discharge ashes generated in the incineration chamber after in¬ cineration of the waste.
