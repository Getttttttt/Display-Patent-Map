abstract
    A portable air curtain incinerator for burning biomass, such as cleared logs and vegetation, is equipped with heat recovery panels along at least one of the sidewalls of the incinerator's firebox, and a heat transfer medium is cycled through the heat recovery panels and expanded to its gaseous phase by heat released during incineration of the biomass. The gaseous medium is directed to drive the turbine of a generator to generate electricity. The heat transfer medium is condensed, preferably using a local source of cooling water, and the cycle is repeated. The air curtain incinerator may include its own generator, or multiple incinerators may be coupled to a single shared generator.
