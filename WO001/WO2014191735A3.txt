abstract
    A plastics processing apparatus (10) having a hopper (12) for receiving a plastics material, a barrel (14) having one or more screws (16) disposed co- axially with the barrel, a breaker plate (18), disposed on a distal end of the barrel, having one or more output apertures (48), a heater (20, 22) and a motor (24) for driving the, or each, screw (16). The heater (20, 22) provides heated fluid to the hopper (12) and/or barrel (14). The heated fluid is heated from heat derived from the exhaust of the driven motor (24).
