abstract
    The invention concerns a method, charging control arrangement, vehicle charging system, computer program and computer program product for charging a vehicle (14) travelling along a road (18) using a charging element (22) provided in or on the road (18). The charging control arrangement (28) receives vehicle data (VD) from the vehicle travelling on the road (18), analyses the vehicle data, selects whether the vehicle (14) is to be charged or not based on the analysing, and in case the vehicle is to be charged: selects the charging element (22) to charge the vehicle, determines a charging time interval, and controls energizing of the charging element as the vehicle travels past it during the charging time interval in order to charge the vehicle.
