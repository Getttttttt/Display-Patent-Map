abstract
    An exhaust gas/liquid heat exchanger (300), in particular, a heat regenerator in a condensing boiler (200). The heat exchanger (300) comprises vessels (305, 306, 307, 308) for the water to be heated which are detached from one another. The vessels (305, 306, 307, 308) are located inside a general container (320) which has walls such as to oblige the exhaust gases to touch the walls of such vessels (305, 306, 307, 308).
