abstract
    The present invention relates to a heat pump apparatus for changing air within closed spaces and related method of operation. Particularly, the invention refers to a heat pump apparatus that allows changing air inside closed spaces during every season in an efficient way, without using complex balance systems of the thermodynamic cycle. The apparatus includes a device that increases the working fluid flow rate that enters the evaporator - if the external conditions require it - and a device for the air flow inversion by means of the condenser and of the evaporator, without inversion of the thermodynamic cycle.
