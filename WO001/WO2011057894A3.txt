abstract
    A heat exchanger (1) with improved exhaust gas discharge device, comprising a container body (2) which accommodates internally at least one coiled duct (3), which is adapted to produce the flow inside it of at least one fluid to be heated (6) and delimits externally a chamber (4) for the combustion of a combustible mixture (5) that is burned in a burner cylinder (16) in order to heat the fluid to be heated (6) with the burned gases (7) produced by the combustion of the combustible mixture (5), the heat exchanger comprising at least one element (11) or similar for conveying the burned gases (7) in order to direct them into a discharge tube (12) which is accommodated within the container body (2) and the combustion chamber (4) and coaxial to the burner cylinder (16) of the heat exchanger (1).
