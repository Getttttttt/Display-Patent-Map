abstract
    The building engineering system comprises heat storage (302); refrigeration equipment (212) having carbon dioxide as refrigerant and comprising an evaporator part (208), expansion valve part (206), compressor part (210) and condenser part (104); a pipe system (108) for circulating the refrigerant in said refrigeration equipment (212); a heat exchanger (202) connected in connection with the condenser part (104) to transfer heat off the refrigeration equipment (212) to the heat storage (302); a supercooler part (200) connected to the pipe system (108) between the condenser part (104) and the expansion valve part (206); an additional heat exchanger part (300) connected to the pipe system (108) in parallel with said evaporator part (208) and expansion valve part (206) to allow heat to be transferred from the additional heat exchanger part (300) to the refrigerant of the pipe system (108) and further to the heat exchanger (202); and a heat transfer pipe system (450) arranged to connect the supercooler part (200), the additional heat exchanger part (300) and at least one other part (204) of the building engineering system to allow heat to be transferred from the supercooler part (200) to the additional heat exchanger part (300) and/or at least one other part (204) of the building engineering system by means of heat carrier in the heat transfer pipe system (450).
