abstract
    Recuperative unit for flue gas waste heat recovery from the smelting aggregate consists of two basic consecutive functional parts, namely a heat exchange equipment combustion products (1) - air with a preheated air outlet (2) to the burner; and heat exchange equipment combustion products (3) - water with a hot water outlet (4) in such a configuration, where the preheated air outlet (2) is situated at the flue gas inlet (5) of the heat exchange equipment combustion products (1) - air; and the cool air inlet (7) is situated at the flue gas outlet (6) of the heat exchange equipment combustion products (1) - air. The heat exchange equipment combustion products (1) - air consists of three segments (8) arranged in three spatial axes, where a part of the segments (8) is revolvable and a part of the segments (8) is firmly anchored. The flue gas pipe is conducted centrally through each segment (8) of the heat exchange equipment combustion products (1) - air and it is concentrically stored in a solid steel casing ensuring cooling space around the flue ducts with tangential air inlets/outlets located at their ends. The heat exchange equipment combustion products (3) - water has a vertical flue gas chamber and the the system placed therein with field pipes for the flow of heated water, with flue gas outlet (9) into the chimney.
