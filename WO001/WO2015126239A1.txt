abstract
    A heat and moisture exchanger comprises a membrane that is selectively permeable to water vapour, having heat conducting fins attached to both its surfaces. The fins on the first surface are arranged in heat conducting relation with the fins on the second surface for enhancing heat transfer through the membrane. In this manner, a first relatively warm, moist air stream flowing over the first surface can transfer heat and moisture through the membrane to a second relatively cooler and drier air stream flowing over the second surface. By additionally providing the membrane with heat conducting fins, greater thermal or sensible heat transfer can be achieved to and through the membrane.
