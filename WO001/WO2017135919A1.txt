abstract
    Hydraulic workover system having at least two sets of hydraulic cylinders coupled with a single load. A plurality of control valves transitionable between a closed position and an open position, the plurality of control valves having at least one extend control valve disposed between each set of hydraulic cylinders and an extend supply pump, at least one retract control valve disposed between each set of hydraulic cylinders and a retract supply pump, and at least one float control valve disposed between each set of hydraulic cylinders and a float supply pump. A logic control system coupled with the plurality of control valves and configured to transition the plurality of control valves between the closed and open position, thereby controlling flow between the at least two sets of hydraulic cylinders and the extend supply pump, retract supply pump, and float supply pump.
