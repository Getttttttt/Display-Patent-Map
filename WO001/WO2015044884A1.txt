abstract
    The present disclosure relates to an air exchanging apparatus (10) including a first conveying device (12) for conveying a first air flow (F1) and a second conveying device (13) for conveying a second air flow (F2). The air exchanging apparatus includes a heat exchanger (15) configured to allow a heat exchange between the first air flow (F1) conveyed by the first conveying device (12) and the second air flow (F2) conveyed by the second conveying device (13). Each of the first conveying device (12) and the second conveying device (13) is configured to convey air by means of suction.
