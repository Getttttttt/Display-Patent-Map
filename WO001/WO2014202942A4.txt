abstract
    A waste heat recovery unit (10} comprises a duct (12) for hot gas. The duct (12) is divided into first, second and third adjacent and parallel channels (44, 46, 48) each with an inlet and an outlet. A heat exchanger is located in each of the first; and third channels (44, 48). The second channel (46) is located between the first and third channels (44, 48) and provides a bypass channel. A damper system (50) is operable to selectively open and close the inlets of the three channels (44, 46, 48). This provides a more compact waste heat recovery unit configuration which is more straightforward to manufacture and maintain.
