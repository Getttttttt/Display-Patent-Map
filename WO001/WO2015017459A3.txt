abstract
    A control system (140) generally comprises at least one sensor that is configured to detect at least one operational mode of a vehicle power generation system (100). A controller (122) is coupled to the sensor, wherein the controller (122) is configured to receive at least one signal representative of the detected operational mode of the vehicle power generation system (100). The controller (122) is also configured to determine whether the detected operational mode is a braking mode, a non-acceleration mode, or an acceleration mode. The controller (122) is configured to control channeling exhaust gas flow to a turbine assembly (110) when the detected operational mode is the braking mode or the non-acceleration mode such that a power output is generated from the exhaust gas flow.
