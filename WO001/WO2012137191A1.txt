abstract
    A gasification burner for combustion of a fuel, comprises a barrel having a front and a back, wherein exhaust gas produced by combustion exits at an outlet, a first air inlet into the barrel and a fuel inlet into the barrel, each positioned adjacent the back, wherein air at a first flow rate and fuel at a fuel flow rate are deliverable at the first air inlet and the fuel inlet, respectively, and a secondary air link operatively connected a second air inlet. The second air inlet is positioned closer to the front of the barrel than the first air inlet, and air at a second flow rate is deliverable at the second air inlet from the secondary air link and into the combustion chamber. A slag trap is operatively connected to the barrel so as to be able to receive slag generated from combustion of the fuel in the barrel, and the slag trap is closer to the back than the second air inlet. The second air inlet is offset with respect to the front from the secondary air link.
