abstract
    A remote heat transfer device for use with an air handling unit comprises: a vapour- compression circuit, the vapour-compression circuit comprising a first heat exchanger adapted to exchange heat between a refrigerant in the vapour compression circuit and a first heat transfer fluid; and a first outlet arranged to provide the first heat transfer fluid to an air supply passage of the air handling unit, so that the first heat transfer fluid exchanges heat with supply air passing through the air supply passage.
