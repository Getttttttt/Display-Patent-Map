abstract
    Described is an apparatus (7) for removing volatile components, such as chloride, alkali and sulphur, from exhaust gases in a cement manufacturing plant, which plant comprises a preheater (1) for preheating cement raw materials, a kiln (5) for burning cement clinker, and a transition zone(3)between the preheater (1) and the kiln (5), said apparatus (7) comprising a cooled condensation body (9)having an outer surface temperature which is lower than the condensation temperature of the volatile components and being placed into the exhaust gases at a location where the temperature of the exhaust gases exceeds the mentioned condensation temperature so that volatile components when brought into contact with the condensation body (9) are cooled to a level below their condensation temperature and are thereby condensed and deposited on the condensation body (9).The apparatus is peculiar in that means (11; 14, 16) for cleaning the condensation body (9) is constantly located inside the plant accommodating the exhaust gases to be cleaned. It is hereby obtained that the cleaning procedure of the condensation body may take place inside the plant, thus an airtight compartment may be omitted,and essential without any interruption.
