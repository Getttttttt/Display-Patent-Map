abstract
    The present invention provides a method for decreasing the temperature of blast-furnace gas temperature peaks which is characterized in that the pressure of the blast-furnace gas is being measured continuously, and injection of water into the blast-furnace gas is triggered off when a threshold value for the pressure is exceeded. The injection of water is carried out in at least one member of the group consisting of the three members blast furnace's furnace throat, off-takes through which blast furnace gas is diverted from the blast furnace to a -first dedusting device, pipes through which the blast furnace gas is diverted from the first dedusting device to a second dedusting device or from the second dedusting device to a further dedusting device. It also provides a devices-system for performing the method comprising means for triggering off (7) the means for injection of water (4) based on a signal of the means for measuring the pressure (6).
