abstract
    A vehicle having an electronic parking brake system is provided. The vehicle includes a braking system having a first rotor and a first caliper. An electric motor is coupled to operate the first caliper. At least one sensor coupled to the vehicle to determine a braking characteristic. A controller electrically is coupled to the electric motor and the at least one sensor, the controller transmitting a first signal to the electric motor in response to receiving a second signal from the at least one sensor and determining that the braking system is performing below a predetermined level, the electric motor actuating the first caliper to apply a clamping force on the first rotor in response to the first signal.
