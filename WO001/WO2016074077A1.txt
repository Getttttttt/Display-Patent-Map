abstract
    An energy exchange system for conditioning air in an interior space of a structure. The system may include at least one supply liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) unit for conditioning air from outside to form supply air for the interior space, and at least one exhaust LAMEE unit for collecting air from the interior space to form exhaust air. An auxiliary loop may fluidly connect between a desiccant liquid outlet of the exhaust LAMEE unit and a desiccant liquid inlet of the supply LAMEE unit. In a first mode, desiccant liquid is circulated between the supply LAMEE unit and the exhaust LAMEE unit. In a second mode, desiccant liquid is circulated between the supply LAMEE unit, the exhaust LAMEE unit, and the auxiliary loop, and water content of the desiccant liquid is decreased in the auxiliary loop.
