abstract
    A method is provided for generating and distributing electricity via an electrical grid, wherein a fossil fuel plant and a renewable energy electricity generating station are interconnected with the electrical grid and are both operable to generate electricity output. The electricity output is directed from both the fossil fuel plant and the renewable energy electricity generating station to the electrical grid for distribution. Then, at the fossil fuel plant, at least a portion of the electricity output is directed to within the plant and utilized in generating hydrogen. The method provides further a reacting step wherein the generated hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide to produce methane. Continued operation of the fossil fuel plant is conducted utilizing the produced methane as fuel, to generate electricity output, and also, capturing carbon dioxide exhaust and utilizing it in the reacting step.
