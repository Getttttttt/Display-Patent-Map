abstract
    A method of operating a gasification facility includes injecting a carbonaceous material into a gasification reactor. The method also includes converting at least a portion of the carbonaceous material into a solid waste byproduct that includes residual carbon. The method further includes reactivating at least a portion of the residual carbon. The method also includes injecting at least a portion of the reactivated carbon into the gasification reactor.
