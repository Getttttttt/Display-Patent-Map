abstract
    - Used in machines/trains/ships/busses/cars etc., through different Anergy circuits as liquid gas/fluid pumping or gas/steam/vapor compression circuits, which all: are placed in the cold-water tank (9), to produce cooling power to be able to absorb all surrounding possible thermal renewable energies, as surrounding temperatures, as air resistance/compression heat from the funnel (50) in vehicles, as solar heat and to be able to recover nearly all heat losses from its own Anergy circuits and to recovered the movement force while braking in amplified thermal energy, to be able to produce kinetic energy -electricity- with their flow engines (6) followed by a pressure reducing tube (3). - The movement force of vehicles is recovered while braking, as amplified heat in the cold-water tank (9).
