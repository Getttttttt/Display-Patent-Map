abstract
    Systems and methods for cooling an electric arc furnace (EAF) using wastewater. Some methods include heating a material disposed with an interior volume an EAF by supplying power to one or more electrodes of the EAF, each being at least partially disposed within the interior volume, and cooling the one or more electrodes using wastewater by transferring heat from the one or more electrodes to the wastewater. Some methods include passing the wastewater through a filter to reduce a total suspended solids content of the wastewater.
