abstract
    The present invention relates to a thermal co-generation plant (1), within which, a fluid flows along a closed circuit, said plant comprising, in series, an evaporator (2), for heating said fluid, a valve (3), at the outlet of said evaporator (2), for adjusting pressure of fluid within said evaporator (2), a turbine (4),within which said fluid expands, generating electric power, a condenser (5), from which fluid exiting from said turbine (4) is entered into a closed circuit, hot water generation plant, a tank (6), for collecting cooled fluid from said hot water generation plant and to send the same to the evaporator (2), and a circulation pump (7), sending fluid at a liquid state, to said evaporator (2), said fluid having a boiling point of about 35°-40°.
