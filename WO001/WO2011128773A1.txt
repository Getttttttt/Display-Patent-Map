abstract
    An exhaust actuated free-piston kinetic engine timed in response to alternating pressurized exhausts from at least two power cylinders having power pistons connected to power output rods within and having exhaust ports in the cylinder walls at the end of their strokes that alternately exhausts spent working fluid from the power cylinders that alternately applies force to the opposite sides of an actuator piston of a moveable valve actuator assembly as the power pistons alternately pass the exhaust ports in order to continuously drive or shuttle the assembly back and forth in a reciprocating manner to control the flow of pressurized working fluid into and out of the engine to run the engine and a suitable power take off means to produce power.
