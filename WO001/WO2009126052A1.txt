abstract
    An electric arc-resistance furnace, in particular for manufacturing of concentrated silicon alloys using the method of silicon dioxide and iron oxides reduction with carbon, which has a furnace tank filled with a charge blend and a gas capture hood situated above it, in which space the post-reaction gases - products of reduction processes proceeding in the furnace tank - are subject to post combustion, connected via a system of flues with a filtration system, consists in the fact that it is equipped with air nozzles supplying in a controlled way the combustion air to the space between the charge surface and the gas capture hood, where the air nozzles are situated in the hood roof (1), in components of electrode column equipment (2), and at the ends of charging pipes (3) situated under the roof, while in the space under the hood and in flues discharging the gases after post- combustion to the filtration system sets of heat exchangers (4) are installed, flushed by hot exhaust gases, through which hot compressed air flows receiving physical heat from hot gases and, once heated, inflows to the expansion gas turbine (5), where mechanical power is generated, converted in the generator into electric energy.
