abstract
    A process fluid cooler (140) can extract thermal energy from a process fluid including carbon dioxide. An absorber (130) can transfer carbon dioxide from the process fluid Io a removal fluid. A reboiler (150) can heat the removal fluid so as Io cause carbon dioxide to be released from the removal fluid and outputted as part of a reboiler output stream. The reboiler can also output a heating fluid A stripper condenser (144) can extract thermal energy (128, 146) from the reboiler output stream so as to cause condensation of water associated with the reboiler output stream and to remove carbon dioxide therefrom. A compression system can remove thermal energy from carbon dioxide received from the stripper condenser. A heat engine can be configured to operate according to an organic Rankine cycle, receiving thermal energy from the heating fluid and/or extracted at the process fluid cooler, at the stripper condenser, and/or at the compression system.
