abstract
    An advanced aftertreatment concept is presented that utilizes gaseous NH3 injection and a waste heat recovery system having volumetric expander which captures waste heat energy from an internal combustion engine via a working fluid. The NH3 comes from the waste heat recovery system's working fluid and is immediately available without the need for a warm-up period on cold start. The consumed NH3 is automatically re-charged in the waste heat recovery system by on-board DEF. The proposed WHR uses NH3-H2O as the working fluid. NH3-H2O has very favorable thermodynamics for a waste heat recovery application. A method of control is also presented that maintains an appropriate ammonia level and concentration in the system.
