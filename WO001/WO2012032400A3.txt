abstract
    An energy recovering device for braking system of vehicles comprises a support body (2, 22) anchorable to a fixed part of the vehicle, an energy storing elastic member (4, 24) housed into said support body (2, 22) and susceptible of turning from a first working position wherein it is unloaded to a second working position wherein it is at least partially loaded, an interface member (5, 25) integral with said energy storing elastic member (4, 24) and associable to the vehicle brake (B), said interface member (5, 25) being susceptible of rotating around a first longitudinal axis (X) for transmitting a torque to said storing member (4, 24) and allowing the transmission thereto of at least part of the energy produced during braking, promoting its turning from said first to said second working position, a transmission member (6, 26) connectable to the propelling means of the vehicle for transmitting to this latter the energy stored by said elastic member (4, 24), unidirectional releasing means (7, 27) of said elastic member (4, 24) for avoiding the turning of said elastic member (4, 24) from said loaded second position to said unloaded first position. The storing elastic member (4, 24) is a substantially longitudinal helical spring having a first longitudinal end (8, 28) integral with said interface member (5, 25) and a second end (9, 29) integral whit said transmission member (6, 26), said unidirectional releasing means (7, 27) comprising a kinematic motion adapted to mechanically connect said transmission element (6, 26) to said second end (9, 29) of said spring (4, 24).
