abstract
    A battery system may include a first battery module that outputs a first voltage and a first current, a second battery module configured to output a second voltage and second current, and a display that depicts visualizations. The battery system may include a processor that may receive an indication to monitor a selected battery module comprising the first battery module or the second battery module, receive properties to monitor regarding the selected battery module, receive data regarding the properties from sensor circuitry configured receive the data from one or more sensors associated with the selected battery module, and generate visualizations that correspond to the one or more properties. Each of the visualizations may indicate a current value that corresponds to each of the properties based on the data. The processor may then display the visualizations on the display.
