abstract
    A cooling system and a cooling unit comprising a rotary desiccant wheel and an indirect cooler for supplying cooled intake-air to an air-conditioned building space and for reusing warmed exhaust-air from an air-conditioned building space to cool the cooled intake-air in the indirect cooler. It is intended that Figure 6 shall be published with the application.
