abstract
    A plant for the abatement of nitrogen oxides and their mixtures present in the fumes of parallel-flow regenerative lime kilns, comprising a first ducting (11), which collects the combustion fumes coming from the outlet of the two shafts of said kiln (10); said plant being characterized in that it comprises: a heater (20) for heating the fumes flowing in said ducting (11) and supplying heated fumes to a second ducting (24); an injector (21) for injecting an ammonia solution into said second ducting (24), which is mixed with the flowing fumes; a third ducting (25), exiting from said injector (21), which carries said ammonia solution and said flowing fumes to a filter (32), said filter (32) being a catalytic filter; and a fourth ducting (34), downstream of said filter (32), which carries the residual fumes to a stack (36); said heater (20) heating the fumes to a temperature higher than 150°C; said injector (21) injecting into said second ducting (24) an amount of ammonia solution lower than 5 l/h; and said catalytic filter (32) comprising a vanadium-oxide-based catalytic fabric.
