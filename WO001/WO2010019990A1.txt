abstract
    A power generation system includes a closed working fluid circuit (1) having a superheater (17), a turbine (2), a condenser (3), a subcooler (4), a receiver (5) and a pump (6). The working fluid is separated into first and second parallel streams. The first parallel stream flows through a first parallel flow path (7) which includes a first heating means (9) adapted to vaporise the working fluid. The second parallel flow path (8) includes second heating means (11) adapted to heat the working fluid with heat removed from the working fluid In the condenser (3), and pressure reducing means (10) upstream of the second heating means (11). An ejector pump (14) recombines the first and second working fluid streams before the working fluid enters the superheating means (18). A solar energy collection system is also described. Solar energy is transferred to. the working fluid via a heat exchanger (27).
