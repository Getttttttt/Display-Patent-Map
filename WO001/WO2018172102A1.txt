abstract
    A system for and a method of managing and controlling the speed of a vehicle, comprising the following steps of: - estimating a length of a route to follow, - measuring an energy capacity of a vehicle, - calculating a maximum energy consumption per unit of length on the basis of the estimated length and of the measured energy capacity and - modulating the instantaneous travel speed of the vehicle so that the instantaneous energy consumption of the vehicle in motion is substantially equal to or less than the calculated maximum energy consumption for each section of the route.
