abstract
    An apparatus and method for recovering heat radiating from the outer surface of a rotary kiln includes an enclosure formed as a stationary housing that has an axially extending opening and closure flaps on circumferential ends of the housing extending towards the shell to form a chamber and an exhaust fan, arranged to draw a flow of air into the housing, which flow of air recovers heat from the kiln shell and is discharged from the chamber for heat recovery therefrom.
