abstract
    Provided is a superheated steam boiler. The superheated steam boiler, in this embodiment, includes an inner tank system, the inner tank system including a first wet tank and a second dry tank separated from one another by an isolation member, an outer sleeve at least partially surrounding the inner tank system, wherein one or more wet tank fluid openings proximate a lower surface of the first wet tank allow the first wet tank to be in fluid communication with the outer sleeve, and further wherein one or more dry tank steam openings in the second dry tank allow the second dry tank to be in steam communication with the outer sleeve, and a burner system located primarily within the inner tank system. The burner system, in this embodiment, includes a combustion/expansion chamber having one or more spherical surfaces located in and fluidly isolated from the first wet tank, a distribution chamber located in and fluidly isolated from the second dry tank, a plurality of heat tubes extending through the isolation member between the combustion/expansion chamber and the distribution chamber; and an exhaust tube extending from the distribution chamber and out of the inner tank system to exit the superheated steam boiler.
