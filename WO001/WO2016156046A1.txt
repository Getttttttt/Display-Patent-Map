abstract
    A vehicle waste heat recovery system for recovering thermal energy from exhaust gases discharged from an engine (12) of the vehicle, the system comprising: a first flow path (16) including a first turbocharging unit (20); a second flow path (18) including a second turbocharging unit (24); a valve arrangement configured to control exhaust gas flow through the first flow path (16) and the second flow path (18) to open and close the first flow path (16) and the second flow path (18) independently of each other; sensing means arranged to provide a signal indicative of the engine load; and control means arranged to control the valve arrangement in response to the indicated engine load.
