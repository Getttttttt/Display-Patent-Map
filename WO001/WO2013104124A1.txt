abstract
    A hybrid air conditioning system associated with a heat pump and an aqueous desiccant/water complex cycle, where in the heat pump is coupled to the aqueous desiccant/water complex cycle, the conditioned room and the environment either directly or indirectly through heat exchanger units, connecting pipes, switches and control valves. The hybrid air conditioning system can be switched into different operation modes and operate appropriately under different weather conditions.
