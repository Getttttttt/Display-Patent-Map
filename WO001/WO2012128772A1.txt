abstract
    In a vehicle electrical system comprising an electrical power source, at least a first load for energization from the electrical power source and a resistive load which may be interposed between the electrical power source and the first load to prevent current inrush upon initialization, a cooling system for the resistive load is provided. Isolation contactors provide for the selective connection of the at least first load to the electrical power source in energization circuits, the electrical contactors allowing interposing and removing the resistive load from the energization circuit from particular energization circuits to suppress inrush currents. A cooling system provides for directing forced gas toward the resistive load during initialization of the first loads. An electrical system controller controls the electrical contactors and turns on and off means for directing the forced gas.
