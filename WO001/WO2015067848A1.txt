abstract
    An energy converter based on a thermodynamic energy conversion process comprises an electrical turbo-machine (101) for converting energy contained by vaporized working fluid into electrical energy, a condenser (104) for condensing the vaporized working fluid outputted by the electrical turbo-machine, a vaporizer (105) for receiving a main heat flow from an external heat source and for vaporizing the condensed working fluid, and a feed pump (106) for pumping the condensed working fluid to the vaporizer. The energy converter can be based on for example the Organic Rankine Cycle. The energy converter further comprises a controllable heating device (107) for generating a controllable auxiliary heat flow to the vaporizer so as to at least partly compensate for temporal variations in the main heat flow. Therefore, the energy converter is suitable for being used also with a varying main heat flow which is sometimes unable to maintain the thermodynamic energy conversion process.
