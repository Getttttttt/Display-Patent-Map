abstract
    A steam generator includes a furnace configured and adapted to generate steam from heat transfer from furnace exit gases from the combustion of municipal solid waste fuel, where tempering air (200) is used for at least two purposes. First, to prevent or minimize corrosion of heat transfer surfaces, specifically a plurality of platens and at least one superheater (108) disposed within an upper portion of the furnace or backpass and second to push and exert a force on the hot flue gas to change the flow pattern and improve superheater metal temperatures.
