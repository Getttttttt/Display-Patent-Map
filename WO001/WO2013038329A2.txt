abstract
    A controller for a vehicle having an electric motor for driving the vehicle and a friction brake for inhibiting movement of the vehicle, the controller comprising means arranged to generate a control signal for actuating the electric motor to consume current for generating a drive torque and means for actuating the friction brake to dissipate energy resulting from the drive torque produced by the electric motor while the drive torque is being generated.
