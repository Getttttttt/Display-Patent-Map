abstract
    A cycle includes a storage chamber, a compressor, a throttle valve, a compressor valve, and a chamber valve. The throttle valve includes a first port, a second port, a third port connectable to the first port, and a fourth port connectable to the second port. The compressor valve is between the compressor and the first port and between the compressor and the second port. The chamber valve is between the storage chamber and the third port and between the storage chamber and the fourth port.
