abstract
    A heat-exchanging device for a primary heat source (11) is described, which is arranged to deliver heat energy (Q) at a first temperature via at least one primary heat exchanger (111) to a heat distribution network (15), in which least one secondary heat exchanger (121) is thermally connected to the at least one primary heat source (11) and is arranged to deliver heat energy (QH) at a second temperature to an energy converter (13), the second temperature being higher than the first temperature. A method of operating a combined heat and power plant (1) by the use of said heat-exchanging device is described as well.
