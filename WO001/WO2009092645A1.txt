abstract
    A method for producing cement clinker from raw material in a cement plant, by which method hot gases from a kiln system (3), through an inlet duct (4), which is connecting the kiln system (3) to a drier crusher (1 ), are directed into the drier crusher (1 ) to which also raw material, via a raw material inlet (5), is fed in order to be crushed and dried for subsequently, in suspended form, to be carried to a classifier (2) via an outlet duct (6), which is connecting the drier crusher (1 ) to the classifier (2). The method is peculiar in that at least some of the hot gases in the inlet duct (4), via a bypass duct (7) connecting the inlet duct (4) to the outlet duct (6), are bypassed the drier crusher (1 ) and directed into the outlet duct (6) at a location between the classifier (2) and the drier crusher (1 ). Hereby it is obtained that the raw material is further dried by the bypassed gases while being carried to the classifier. In this way the volume of hot gases used for drying can be increased, i.e. the drying capacity of the system can be increased without causing an increase in the pressure loss across the drier crusher.
