abstract
    The invention refers to a plant and a procedure for treatment in continuous flow of garbage and industrial waste containing rubber, plastics, metals, pulp and other components resulting from household consumption or industrial use. The problem solved by the group of inventions, according to claimed inventions, is that domestic and industrial waste containing rubber and plastic is treated with the reduction of hazardous emissions resulting from combustion with the recovery of a fuel gas component by washing the smoke in water and placing the dirty water from smoke washing into a reactor, for chemical and physical transformations. It was unexpectedly found that waste recovery, due to the washing of smoke 'with water, whose pH is maintained at a value of 2... 5, such residues are retained by the liquid environment so that it is possible to treat the multi- phase system in a field where a certain energy expressed in eV/cm exists. Following this treatment, gas is generated, which contains hydrogen, oxygen and carbon in an atomic state, the temperature gradient decreases with a constant value forming an amorphous carbon deposit which is recovered, and gas is used as fuel gas... Thermal energy is recovered from the hot smoke at the boiler exit by means of a heat economizer which turns steam into gas at a certain temperature, gas composed of hydrogen and oxygen and which is used to maintain a constant temperature inside the boiler for household waste incineration when other domestic waste with low heating power is burned in the boiler.
