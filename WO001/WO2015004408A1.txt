abstract
    A battery powered cycle and method for providing a charging current to a battery powered cycle., the cycle has a rider support and wheels that are rotatably mounted to the rider support. There is an electric motor with an output shaft coupled to one of the wheels and rechargeable batteries are mounted to the rider support. A controller is arranged to selectively supply electrical power from the rechargeable batteries to the motor. A first electrical machine has an output continuously electrically coupled to the bank of batteries, and the first electrical machine has an input drive shaft coupled to one of the wheels to thereby provide a charging current to the rechargeable batteries when the cycle is in forward motion.
