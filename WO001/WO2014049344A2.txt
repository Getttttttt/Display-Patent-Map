abstract
    A thermal store (100) has a heat storage unit (1) with a heat storage medium (2), a first heat exchange system (3) through which a high temperature fluid can be passed to transfer heat to the heat storage medium, and a second heat exchange system (28) for transferring heat from the heat storage medium to a target. The second heat exchange system includes a conductive heat transfer element (8) and a fluid circuit (11, fig. 9) for a heat transfer fluid operatively connected with the conductive heat transfer element (8). The thermal store has a control system (110, Fig. 9) operative to selectively change the second heat exchange system (28) between a conductive heat transfer configuration and a non-conductive heat transfer configuration. The control system may be operative to regulate the thermal store in order to ensure safe operation and to move the store between heat storage and heat transfer modes.
