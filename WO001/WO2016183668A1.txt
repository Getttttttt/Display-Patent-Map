abstract
    An example system is configured to control conditions in an enclosed space. The system includes scavenger and process plenums, a liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE), a first liquid-to-air heat exchanger (LAHX), a second LAHX, and a fluid circuit The scavenger plenum is configured to direct scavenger air from a scavenger inlet to a scavenger outlet. The process plenum is sealed from the scavenger plenum and is configured to direct process air from a process inlet to a process outlet The process inlet receives heated air from the space and the process outlet supplies cooled air to the space. The LAMEE is arranged inside the scavenger plenum. The LAMEE is configured to use the scavenger air to evaporatively cool a first fluid flowing through the LAMEE. The temperature of the first fluid at a LAMEE outlet is lower than the temperature of the first fluid at a LAMEE inlet. The first LAHX is arranged inside the process plenum. The first LAHX is configured to directly and sensibly cool the heated air from the space to a supply air temperature using a second fluid flowing through the first LAHX. The second LAHX is arranged inside the scavenger plenum downstream of the LAMEE. The second LAHX is configured to receive and cool the second fluid heated by the first LAHX using the scavenger air. The fluid circuit transports the first and second fluids among the LAMEE, the first LAHX, and the second LAHX.
