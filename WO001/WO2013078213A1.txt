abstract
    A hydraulic system includes a tank (20) for hydraulic fluid, a supply line (18) connected to a pump (22) and a plurality of hydraulic functions (12, 14, 16)connected to the supply line (18). Each hydraulic function includes an actuator (26, 28, 30) that is connectable to a load and that has a first side and a second side. Each function includes a first control valve (50) connected to the first side and a second control valve (52) connected to the second side. Each function also has an independent tank line (43, 44, 45), and the first and second control valves (50, 52) are connected to both the supply line (18) and the independent tank line (43, 44, 45). A third control valve (58, 70) is connected between the independent tank line (43, 44, 45) and the tank (20), and a check valve (62) is connected between the supply line (18) and the independent tank line (43, 44, 45).
