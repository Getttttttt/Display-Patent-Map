abstract
    An energy system for a vehicle, the energy system comprising an electric machine arranged to provide a drive torque when placed in a drive mode of operation and arranged to generate current when placed in a braking mode of operation; a resistor placed in series with a switch and a capacitor, wherein the switch is arranged to control the flow of current generated by the electric machine through the resistor to allow energy to be stored on the capacitor and for energy to be dissipated in the resistor.
