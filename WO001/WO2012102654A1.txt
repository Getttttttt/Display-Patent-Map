abstract
    The invention describes an integrated electro-hydraulic hybrid system (100) to store and produce energy. The integrated electro-hydraulic hybrid system (100) includes a hydraulic accumulator (102), a hydraulic pump/motor (112) operatively coupled with the hydraulic accumulator (102), an electric motor/generator (106) directly coupled with the hydraulic pump/motor (112), and one or more peripheral units (120). The one or more peripheral units (120) are either a hydraulic system (120a) or an electrical system (120b-e). The electric motor/generator (106) is coupled with at least one electrical peripheral unit (120b-e) to receive/supply electrical energy wherein the electric motor/generator (106) interacts with the hydraulic pump/motor (112) to load the hydraulic accumulator (102). Moreover, the hydraulic accumulator (102) is directly coupled with at least one hydraulic peripheral unit (120a) to receive/supply hydraulic energy bypassing the electric motor/generator (106) and the hydraulic pump/motor (112).
