abstract
    An air conditioner that kills dust mites, bacteria, and fungus using humidity control comprises an air-reconditioning unit (3) installed in the outdoor air conditioner unit (1). The air-reconditioning unit (3) comprises an air pump creating air suction in two attached tubes (13, 14). A first tube (13) brings in moisture from a water-based heat exchanger (2). A second tube (14) brings in heat from a fan (5). The mixture is sent through an air pipe (4) back into a room through the indoor air conditioner unit (6). The air conditioner controls the level of moisture and heat brought in from outside into the room.
