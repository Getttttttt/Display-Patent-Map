abstract
    A system, method and apparatus for treating a waste gas stream containing on or more hydrocarbon contaminants such polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The system, method and apparatus may include a heat treatment chamber having a recycling apparatus that includes a supply of a food oil solvent; a mixing device to mix the solvent with the waste gas stream. The system, method and apparatus dissolve the hydrocarbon contaminants from the gas stream into a solvent containing the food oil.
