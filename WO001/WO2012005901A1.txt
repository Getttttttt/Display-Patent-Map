abstract
    A regenerative firing system is disclosed which functions in a heat treating furnace or other high temperature technology. The system comprises a plurality of regenerator heat transfer boxes which absorb the heat contained in high temperature exhaust from the furnace. Each regenerator box transfers this absorbed heat to a flow of ambient air. The now heated air flows from the regenerator box into a common air stream which is then fed to a plurality of burners. The preheated air stream is supplied to a common air stream that is then simultaneously provided to each of a plurality of burners. The design of the current system allow for the regenerators to be placed in any convenient location around the furnace. The regenerative system may also be adapted to current heat treating furnaces. In addition, the current invention comprises a method of heat recovery for a furnace utilizing the inventive system. The regenerators produce a common preheated combustion air supply which then flows to a plurality of burners. The heated air produced from each regenerator flows to each of the burners. Each regenerator performs a different step of the method at any given time, allowing each of the burners to continuously fire.
