abstract
    A system for cooling a cylinder head includes a cylinder head, a cylinder block, and a waste heat recovery system. The cylinder head includes a first water jacket and a second water jacket. The cylinder block is coupled to the cylinder head. The cylinder head includes a third water jacket. The first water jacket is coupled to a first cooling circuit. The second water jacket is coupled to a second cooling circuit. The third water jacket is coupled to a third cooling circuit. The waste heat recovery system is coupled to at least one of the first cooling circuit, the second cooling circuit, and the third cooling circuit.
