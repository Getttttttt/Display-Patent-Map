abstract
    Tunnel oven (3) and associated method for the heat treatment of friction elements (2), and in particular of braking elements such as brake pads, wherein the friction elements are arranged on a resting surface (10) of a conveyor device (9) and moved between an inlet opening and an outlet opening of the tunnel oven and are heated by irradiation by at least one heating device (11) including a radiating plate (12) in stainless steel arranged facing the conveyor device and heated by electromagnetic induction by means of at least one inductor (13) arranged facing the radiating plate and spaced apart therefrom on the side opposite to the conveyor device; between the resting surface (10) and the radiating plate (12) being directed in counterflow to a feeding direction (D) of the conveyor device.
