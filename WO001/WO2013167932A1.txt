abstract
    The invention concerns an internal combustion engine arrangement for a vehicle, comprising: - an internal combustion engine (2), an intake line (3) capable of carrying intake gases towards the engine (2) and an exhaust line (4) capable of collecting exhaust gases from said engine (2); - a waste heat recovery system (5) carrying a working fluid in a loop, in which said working fluid is successively compressed, heated in a heat exchanger (6) by means of at least one engine fluid, and expanded in a first expander (7); - a first compressor (10) located in said intake line (3), characterized in that the first compressor (10) is mechanically connected to the first expander (7) of the waste heat recovery system (5).
