abstract
    A cooling system for a building (3). A desiccant regenerating section (2) is used to regenerate diluted desiccant liquid into concentrated desiccant liquid using a solar or waste heat source (30), and a desiccant cooling section (1) is used to cool air and comprises a first mass-heat exchanger (11) and a second mass-heat exchanger (12). The first mass-heat exchanger (11) comprises a scavenging air pathway for evaporatively cooling a scavenging or return air stream which is then used to cool the concentrated desiccant liquid, and a process air pathway for dehumidifying a first incoming air stream (20) using the cooled concentrated desiccant liquid. The second mass-heat exchanger (12) comprises a first air pathway for evaporatively cooling the first incoming air stream using water, and an outlet for outputting the cooled air stream (16) to the building (3).
