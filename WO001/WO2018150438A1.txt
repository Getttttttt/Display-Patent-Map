abstract
    A regenerative braking system (50) for a cycle rickshaw (100) is provided herein. The regenerative braking system (50) includes a central hollow shaft (20) provided on a rickshaw main shaft (30). The regenerative braking system (50) further includes a handle section (24) located near main handle of the rickshaw. The regenerative braking system (50) further includes a gear section (25) having a first bevel gear (19), a second bevel gear (10), a third bevel gear (13), and a fourth bevel gear (15). The regenerative braking system (50) further includes a spring section (26) configured to store energy of the second bevel gear (10) in a spring (1), based on engagement of the first bevel gear (19) and the second bevel gear (10) during rotation of the central hollow shaft (20). The spring section (26) is further configured to release energy based on disengagement of the first bevel gear (19) and the second bevel gear (10) to effect the movement of the cycle rickshaw (100) in a forward direction.
