abstract
    A method for determination of a braking location for regenerative braking of a vehicle (1) to a known stop location. The regenerative braking is effected with a braking force which comprises a regenerative force component Fe imparted by a regenerative brake system (30) of the vehicle. The method comprises the steps of: i) determining a distance between a momentary location and the stop location, ii) determining a braking distance for said regenerative braking on the basis of the momentary speed and Fe ,iii) determining whether the distance between the momentary location of the vehicle and the stop location is within said braking distance, and iv) generating a signal that said braking location has been reached if the distance between the momentary location of the vehicle and the stop location is within said braking distance, otherwise the above method steps are repeated.
