abstract
    The subject of the invention is universal air blowing and exhausting device, which operates PLC controlled rows of lamellas and fans within a single unit for removing the warm air and for introducing cold air into the room, so that the air exchange is accomplished by passing the air flow coming through the fan (13) and the intake channel (3) to the lamellas of the internal air baffle (4), where it is impacted and divided to the lateral channel (7) and to the internal channel (6), and then blown into the room through the upper air guide grating (8) after flowing through the motor driven rows of lamellas (12), while the air is sucked in through the lower air guide grating (9), which is fixed at the lower part of the framework (1), and then passed through the internal space and the row of motor driven lamellas (12) and the fan (13) for discharging through the upper outlet channel (10).
