abstract
    An air brake system is provided for using the air resistance of a car (1) to produce energy and for simultaneously braking the car (1). The air brake system comprises an air intake port (2) having an open and a closed position. The air intake port (2) can be arranged, for instance, on the car (1) grille or on the sides of the car (1). The air intake port (2) is connected to an air guiding channel (4) disposed inside of the car (1), preferably in the hood compartment or engine bay thereof. The air entering the air intake port (2) in its open position and being guided through the air guiding channel (4) acts on energy conversion means being configured to convert the kinetic energy of the moving air into a different usable form of energy. Preferably, the energy conversion means comprise a rotatable fan (5) and a generator (6). The fan (5) is arranged inside of the air guiding channel (4) so that air entering the air intake port (2) in its open position and being guided through the air guiding channel (4) passes by the fan (5) and causes a rotating motion thereof. The fan (5) is operatively connected to the generator (6) for converting the rotational energy of the fan (5) and, thus, ultimately the energy of the air entering via the air intake port (2) in its open position and moving through the car (1) via the air guiding channel (4) into electric energy, which can be stored, for instance, by a battery of the car (1). The inventive air brake system, thus, provides for the advantage that in addition to using an increased air resistance for braking the car (1) this braking action is also producing energy that can be re-used by the car (1).
