abstract
    The present disclosure envisages a system that increases the regenerative feed heating of feed water. The system includes a steam turbine that is configured to receive high pressure steam provide low pressure expanded steam subsequent to the expansion of the high pressure steam thereon. A condenser that is configured to receive a first stream of expanded steam and facilitate the condensation of the first stream to provide a condensate. The LP heater is configured to receive the condensate and a second stream of expanded steam and generate a heated condensate. The deaerator is configured to receive the heated condensate and facilitate removal of dissolved oxygen from the heated condensate. The VAM comprises a VAM condenser that is configured to facilitate heating of the condensate prior to entering within the LP heater. A VAM absorber configured to facilitate heating of the heated condensate prior to entry within the deaerator.
