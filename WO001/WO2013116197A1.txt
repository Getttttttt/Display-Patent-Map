abstract
    An energy recovery system includes a heating and cooling system having a controller and a furnace or fan coil in fluid communication with each of a return air duct and a supply air duct; and an energy recovery ventilator (ERV) having an intake air duct and an exhaust air duct, the ERV being energized by a direct electrical connection to the heating and cooling system. The return air duct is operable to receive stale conditioned air from a conditioned air space while the controller is configured for controlling the ERV to transfer energy from the stale conditioned air to an outside air stream. A method of recovering energy with a heating and cooling system.
