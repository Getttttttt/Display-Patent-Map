abstract
    The present invention relates to an air cleaning and heating system for a building having several rooms (I-VI) to be heated, said system comprises an air heater (1), means (12) for passing air through said air heater, channels (2, 3-8) for leading heated air from the air heater to each said room in said building, a mixing chamber (11) for mixing of air from inside the building and air from outside the building, said chamber being in connection with a channel leading air through said air heater, a channel (14) leading from means (15) for intake of air from outside of the building and having an outlet (13) in said mixing chamber, and means (9, 10) for leading used air to the outside of the building. According to the invention the outlet (13) for air from outside the building in said mixing chamber (11) is directed in a direction parallel to the flow direction of the air from the inside of the building in said mixing chamber, and a HEPA filter (18) is disposed in an inlet of a channel (17) leading from inside of the building to said mixing chamber.
