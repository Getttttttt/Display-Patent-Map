abstract
    The basic condition of thermodynamics is that it is closed circuit. This is a main prerequisite for a thermodynamics system to be measurable and controllable. This is in full the ground on which CHP-w has been set up. There should not be any misconception about CHP-w like that; how can a thermodynamic equality produce more work reversely ? It is a fact that an equality must be the same on both sides. However, Cogeneration and Cogeneration-w are not two sides of an equality. Cogeneration and Cogeneration- w consist of a seperate equations in itself. Cogeneration is a method of recovering of the heat by using thermodynamic parameters that has fallen into an inert state in an open system. Whereas, the CHP-w predicates on a closed thermodynamic system which aspires to arise the work output as target. CHP-w method has been set up over the features of taking under control to boiler inner combustion- fluid balance with elastic superheated steam production level, except for flue gas avoiding to directly use of boiler inner heat as much as possible, collecting to boiler inner heat in a only hand by producing superheated steam and having been able to converted the enthalpy/ heat temperature and kinetic energy/ pressure into one another through different steam types in a closed system. CHP-w energy generation method obtains as much superheated steam as possible from the boiler inner heat, excluding to the flue gas and produces the work from it. If the steam to be remained in desired type and amount from the work generation by taking from turbine output whether directly as steam, or which uses by converting it over again to the heat energy is the name of a closed thermodynamic system. Provided that to use CHP-w method, the MDF wood panel production facilities in particular have the opportunity to generate electrical energy at a highly significant rate with their own biomass production residues. The same thing is a valid state for other wood-based panel manufacturing facilities whose woody-biomass residues to be left from production is not as much as MDF production process. The rate of heat required to produce superheated steam is very low. All the work done by the superheated steam is only done with this small amount of energy. At the same time this is the total amount of energy that is lost by transforming to work in a closed system. It is the cost of work. The most largest part of the generated heat in the boiler is spent to the water at 104Â°C temperature to convert to saturated steam. However, this spent-heat energy can be recovered again through a suitable type of steam in a closed system and can be evaluated in the manner what is desired, whereever it is needed.
