abstract
    A turbomachine assembly for recovering waste heat generally has a compressor section that is configured to generate a compressed fluid flow and to channel the compressed fluid flow within the turbomachine assembly. A turbine section is coupled to the compressor section via a rotating member such that portions of the rotating member are located within the compressor section and the turbine section, respectively. The turbine section is in flow communication with the compressor section such that the compressed fluid flow is received by the turbine section. At least one heat exchanger is positioned at least partly within the turbine section where the heat exchanger receives waste heat energy. The heat exchanger transfers energy from the waste heat into the compressed fluid flow to increase at least one parameter of the compressed fluid flow contributing to the generation of a power output.
