abstract
    Proposed is a heating system with multiple radiators which utilizes a cycling steam source. During the heating cycle, condensate is retained in the radiators and released later through the steam supply line. Such condensate and steam flows alternation on the same line eliminates water hammering and justifies the usage of smaller diameter tubes and a new radiator design. When air is evacuated, the system operates like a branched heat pipe with periodic condensate return. The system may include a vacuum check valve on the air vent lines and an operational procedure to naturally create a vacuum through the condensation of steam in an enclosed space after the complete purging of air from the system. The steam/vapor source cut off pressure can be adjusted to regulate the vapor temperature depending on the outside temperature. The proposed method can be utilized for the conversion of existing steam heating systems into vapor/vacuum systems with a naturally induced vacuum.
