abstract
    A vehicle 100 (Figure 1) includes a braking system 100a (Figure 2) that includes a foundation braking system 111 and a hydraulic braking system 112. According to method 100b (Figures 3 and 4), system controller 117 (Figure 2) at successive steps 120-127 determines when hydraulic regenerative braking system 112 cannot provide full commanded braking torque and acts through proportional treadle valve 116a to provide a proportional transition between an isolated hydraulic braking mode and an isolated foundation braking mode. According to methods 200b (Figures 7-8) and 200b (Figures 9-10), proportional braking is approximated. According to method 300 (Figure 11), hydraulic braking is reduced at the initiation of a braking event based upon the estimated kinetic energy of the vehicle and available capacity for storing that energy.
