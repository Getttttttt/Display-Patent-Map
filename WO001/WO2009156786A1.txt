abstract
    A unitary, hybrid engine which includes an internal combustion engine which is used both for locomotive and heat generation externally of the cylinders of the combustion engine, wherein the generated heat is employed in conjunction with an evaporator to generate steam, which is then stored in an energy accumulator which retains the stored energy by way of a pressured water containment unit. The pressurized water containment unit accretes the energy and, upon attainment of a predetermined pressure and liquid level, the steam is transmitted to one or more of the cylinders of the unitary engine to provide the motive power to the unitary engine. The engine includes control systems to permit the sole use of steam during such times as may be required for environmental or pollution control requirements. The control systems may also selectively permit the use of steam in one or more of the cylinders of the engine simultaneously with the use of fossil fuel in others. The energy accumulation system may, alternatively, be employed to provide the motive power to an engine other than the one from which it has accreted the energy or may provide an energy source to an alternative power consumption device which does not result in the generation of motive power.
