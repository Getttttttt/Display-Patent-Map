abstract
    A system for heat recovery and pressure control including: a fresh air heat exchanger with at least one fresh air heat exchanger conduit, a pre-heater heat exchanger with at least one pre-heater heat exchanger conduit, and a proportioning valve coupled to the conduits. The fresh air heat exchanger is adapted to warm the fresh air by transferring heat from the at least one fresh air heat exchanger conduit. The pre-heater heat exchanger is adapted to pre-heat the contaminated air by transferring heat from the at least one pre-heater heat exchanger conduit. The conduits are adapted to receive hot air and transfer heat from the hot air. The proportioning valve is adapted to control the flow of hot air through the conduits.
