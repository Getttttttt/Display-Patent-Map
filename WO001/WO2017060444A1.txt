abstract
    The invention relates to an arrangement comprising a direct current, DC, traction power network (1) adapted for supplying electrical energy to a rail system (4), a transformer (14), and an energy recuperation device (3) adapted for returning surplus electrical energy of the DC traction power network (1) into an AC traction network (5) and/or an energy storage system (6) adapted for storing surplus electrical energy of the DC traction power network (1) and for feeding back the stored electrical energy into the DC traction power network (1), whereby the transformer (14) is electrically connected in series between the DC traction power network (1) and the energy recuperation device (3) and/or the energy storage system (6), and/or, comprising the energy recuperation device (3) electrically connected in series between the DC traction power network (1) and the transformer (14).
