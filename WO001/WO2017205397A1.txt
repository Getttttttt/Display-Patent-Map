abstract
    A method includes installing a CHP system to be operated by an operator. The operator becomes qualified as a market participant in a wholesale electricity market. An electrical output generated from the CHP system is connected to a first conductive path, the first conductive path operatively conducting power and energy to a grid for sale into the wholesale electricity market. Waste heat generated from the CHP system is utilized to provide one of a product and a process. An efficiency of the waste heat and an electrical efficiency of the electrical output are combined to attain an overall CHP system efficiency of 60 percent or greater.
