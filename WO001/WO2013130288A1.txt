abstract
    An engine exhaust heat recovery system (10) includes an engine exhaust heat conduit (22) that interacts with a two-phase fluid (27) that exists in liquid and gaseous states (39) within a single closed loop. A first heat exchanger (24), which may be a boiler (24), interfaces with and receives heat from the engine exhaust conduit. Exhaust heat energy converts the fluid (27) from the liquid state into the gaseous state (39) for transfer into a heat expander (50) situated downstream of the first heat exchanger (24). The heat expander (50) utilizes the gaseous heat energy to rotate a flywheel (80), and a system of clutches (60, 62) is situated and adapted to permit the flywheel (80) to transfer mechanical energy for subsequent, selective production of work upon demand. In one disclosed embodiment, the heat expander (50) may be a high-speed turbine with a rotary power shaft (52) coupled to a transmission (70) and a plurality of clutches (60, 62) adapted to engage and actuate the flywheel (80).
