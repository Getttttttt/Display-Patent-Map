abstract
    Contemplated configurations and methods are presented for effectively controlling the temperature in an oxy-fuel combustion system. Contemplated systems preferably introduce water independent of the fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber. Water is injected through one or more nozzles, wherein water is atomized or sprayed, creating boundary layer cool zones in a boiler system and wherein water is recovered.
