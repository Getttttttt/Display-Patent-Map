abstract
    The hot air unit heater comprises a combustion chamber, Î¼ liquid or gas fuel burner, a flue gas-air heat exchanger in connection with the combustion chamber, a fan unit for causing a forced circulation of the air to be heated. The combustion chamber and the flue gas-air heat exchanger are arranged in parallel with respect to the flow direction of the air to be heated. Two separate and independent fan units are provided for causing a forced circulation of the air to be heated over the outer surface of said combustion chamber and over the outer surface of said flue gas-air heat exchanger, respectively.
