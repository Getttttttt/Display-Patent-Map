abstract
    A control system algorithm is provided for the computer control of a solid-state switching device in a Stirling-electric hybrid vehicle. The algorithm satisfies the demands for electrical energy management, regulation, allocation and distribution to the electrical system of the vehicle during the operation thereof. The control system controls the management, regulation, allocation and distribution of electrical current throughout the vehicle's electrical system in response the commands of the vehicle operator. This includes the operation of wheel motors, electrical storage systems, the drivetrain and a plurality of other components, accessories and subsystems.
