abstract
    A motor vehicle including a hybrid electric drive train, a multiple bus power distribution system for the drive train and loads, and a control system including a plurality of switching devices allowing selective connection and disconnection of the buses from loads, the drive train and electrical power storage elements, provides for power flow control. Power flow control is responsive to the electrical machine entering its traction mode monitoring power flow from the electrical power storage device, to the electrical machine entering its generator mode monitoring the output voltage level of the electrical machine, to the electrical power storage device exceeding a maximum permitted rate reconfiguring the motor vehicle to deliver less power to the electrical machine, or to the voltage level from the electrical machine exceeding a maximum permitted level directing the electrical machine to reduce power output.
