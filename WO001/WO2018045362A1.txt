abstract
    This embodiment is a Stirling-Electric Hybrid automotive exhaust module generator device for converting waste heat energy into electrical energy by employing the Seebeck Effect. The disclosure herein describes how the invention converts heat energy, from hot exhaust gases, from the operation of an automotive external combustion engine (e. g. Stirling Cycle engine), into electrical energy which is fed back into the electrical system of the Stirling-Electric Hybrid Automobile (Patent Number 7,726, 130 B2) minimizing losses due to the second law of thermodynamics. The improvements on the art in this disclosure focuses on employing a plurality of thermopiles and materials with improved coefficients of thermal conductivity and increasing residence time of the hot exhaust gases by inducing turbulent flow through the module generator device in conjunction with external cooling plate(s), heat sink(s); in the form of a plurality of pin(s), on the interior and exterior surface(s) of the module generator device.
