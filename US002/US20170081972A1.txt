abstract
    An electric and steam system includes an electrical generator assembly configured to receive a first portion of a flow of a boil off gas (NBOG). An oxidizing unit is configured to receive a second portion of the flow of the boil off gas (NBOG), the second portion being an excess of the flow of the boil off gas (NBOG) that the electrical generator can process, and a crossover duct configured to receive a first flow of exhaust gas from the electrical generator assembly and a second flow of exhaust gas from the oxidizing unit and channel the first and second flows to an inlet of a heat recovery steam generator.
