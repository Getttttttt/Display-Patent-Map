abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric power storage, an electric power generator, a rotating electric machine, and circuitry. The rotating electric machine is driven with electric power stored in the electric power storage and/or generated by the electric power generator to move the vehicle. The circuitry is configured to calculate target driving force for rotating electric machine, to detect surplus electric power which is generated due to a response delay of the electric power generator upon decreasing an amount of electric power generated by the electric power generator when the target driving force decreases, and to drive the rotating electric machine, when detecting the surplus electric power, with a phase current different from a maximum efficiency phase current with which an electric current value or electric power loss of the rotating electric machine is smallest so that the rotating electric machine consumes the surplus electric power.
