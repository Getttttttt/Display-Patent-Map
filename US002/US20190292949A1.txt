abstract
    A method of recovering heat from an exhaust stream during a manufacturing process is provided. The method includes providing a condensing heat exchanger having a first side with cold recirculation water and a second side; passing an exhaust stream of vapors having a temperature of 500 degrees F. or less into the heat exchanger through the second side. Heat from the exhaust stream is transferred to the first side of the condensing heat exchanger and the vapors are thus cooled to the dew point to cause condensation. The condensation is collected in a condensate tank where an amount recovered is from 20% to 75%. The condensate water is transferred to a flash tank and used to adjust the volume of the recirculation water routed thereto. External make-up water is input into the flash tank but is reduced by the amount of condensate water recovered by the heat stack recovery system.
