abstract
    Motor vehicle having a hybrid drive which includes at least one wheel which can be driven by an electric machine, wherein a recuperation device is provided which permits recuperation of energy in a recuperation phase during a braking process, wherein a brake system is provided with a pedal, at least one master brake cylinder and at least one wheel brake which fluidically activates the wheel brake on the basis of a movement of the pedal by a brake pressure, wherein a pressure-reducing valve device is provided which reduces the brake pressure in the recuperation phase, and wherein a compensator is provided for compensating a hydraulic effect of the pressure-reducing valve device, wherein in the effective range of the pressure-reducing valve device two master brake cylinders are provided whose pistons are rigidly coupled to one another via a connecting element.
