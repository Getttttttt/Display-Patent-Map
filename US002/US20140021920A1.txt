abstract
    A first DC/DC converter (5) is of a constant voltage control type and is controlled so as to keep the voltage of an electric generation bus (A) at a predetermined target value. A second DC/DC converter (7) is of a constant current control type and is controlled so as to keep input current or output current at predetermined target current. A control circuit (8) determines an optimum target value Va* of electric generation bus voltage, based on different algorithms, in accordance with all or some of modes A to C which are classified by the charging/discharging condition of a second electric storage device (6), and controls the first DC/DC converter (5) so that the electric generation bus voltage Va becomes the determined target value Va*.
