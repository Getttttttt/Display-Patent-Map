abstract
    A method is provided for separating hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from an offgas stream from a direct reduced iron furnace. The offgas is directed to a separation device which will separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide using a hydrogen sulfide absorber and a carbon dioxide absorber. The hydrogen sulfide can be recycled for reuse in the furnace and the carbon dioxide recovered for other additional uses.
