abstract
    Automated systems, methods, techniques, processes, products and product components are provided to implement an advanced and energy efficient hot water heating system control scheme that incorporates an advanced hot water reset for the boilers, including condensing boilers in hydronic systems. The advanced controls are provided to substantially enhance combustion (heating) efficiency for the boilers. The disclosed schemes replace conventional linear hot water reset with a device which can stand alone or integrate with boiler control technology or an existing building automation system to create a unique (non-linear) boiler reset curve based on various inputs. The schemes allow boiler control systems to learn and adapt over time maximizing the efficiency of a condensing boiler plant, by providing an independent, intelligent, economical, monitorable and manipulable solution eliminating the need of a head end BAS control system.
