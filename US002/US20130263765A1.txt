abstract
    Pipe insulation, such as may be used to insulate the condensate pipe of a heating appliance such as condensing boiler, the pipe insulation comprising a flexible internal conduit surrounded by a flexible layer of insulation, in which the layer of insulation comprise fibers between which is trapped air. Typically, the insulation layer can comprise a silica nanoporous aerogel with reinforcing fibers.
