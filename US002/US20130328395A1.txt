abstract
    A power plant, in the form of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, may be co-located with a data center to provide redundant electrical power. The CHP plant and the data center may operate as an island, separate from the local electrical-utility grid. The CHP plant may have a redundant fuel source connection to reduce unavailability of fuel for the CHP and increase the uptime of the data center. The CHP plant may include turbines and engines to manage variable loads within the data center. The power plant may include multiple distributions busses in high-availability configurations to provide highly-reliable and high-quality electricity to the data center. The positioning of these elements in the power plant design provides economies of scale and eliminates single points of failure commonly found in data center configurations, increasing the reliability of the data center.
