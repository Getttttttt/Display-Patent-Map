abstract
    The present techniques provide systems and methods for recovering energy from flare gases in chemical plants and refineries. The systems use an engine to burn a portion of gas diverted from the flare system. The engine may be a reciprocating engine, or a burner in a boiler system, among others. The power generated by burning the flare gas is then used to power an energy recovery device. The energy recovery device may be an electrical generator, a compressor, or a steam boiler, among others.
