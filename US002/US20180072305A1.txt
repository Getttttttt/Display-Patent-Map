abstract
    A system for controlling regenerative braking in a hybrid vehicle, includes: a driving information sensor detecting driving information; a motor assisting a driving force of an engine in an acceleration interval of the hybrid vehicle; a motor controller charging a battery using a regenerative energy generated by the motor; a hybrid controller calculating a first braking force generated by friction in the engine according to a first gear stage of the hybrid vehicle, setting a second braking force due to friction in the engine used to compensate for a limited regenerative braking force using a kick-down shifting at a second gear stage as a target regenerative braking force, and controlling the kick-down shifting using a third gear stage that compensates for the limited regenerative braking force and corresponds to the braking force due to friction in the engine; and a transmission controller performing the kick-down shifting.
