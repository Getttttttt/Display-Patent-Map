abstract
    A brake control apparatus includes: a fluid storing section for storing a quantity of brake fluid that is flown out of a master cylinder by driver's braking operation; pressure-increasing control valves each of which is disposed between the master cylinder and a corresponding one of wheel cylinders; a master cylinder pressure reduction control valve disposed in a fluid passage connected between the master cylinder and the fluid storing section. A hydraulic pressure control section is configured to perform a control operation when a braking force is being controlled with a regenerative braking system, wherein the control operation includes: controlling at least one of the pressure-increasing control valves toward closed state; controlling the master cylinder pressure reduction control valve toward open state; and allowing the quantity of brake fluid to flow into the fluid storing section.
