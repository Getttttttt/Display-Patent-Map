abstract
    The present invention provides a moisture separator separating condensed water mist in compressed air, and an air cycle system provided with the same. The moisture separator includes a coalescer filter and a wire mesh pad demister. The coalescer filter is provided with a filter media formed of a fiber layer through which compressed air is passed, primarily condensing moisture mist in the compressed air, and filtering foreign particles and a housing supporting the filter media. The wire mesh pad demister is provided at a downstream of the coalescer filter to receive the compressed air passed through the coalescer filter and secondarily condenses moisture mist in the compressed air to separate moisture using gravity.
