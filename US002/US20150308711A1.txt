abstract
    A hot water heater or similar heating device includes equipment for pre-cooling hot flue gas while preheating water for the water heater. It further includes a heat and mass exchanger for transferring heat and water from the pre-cooled flue gas to combustion air for the hot water heater. The pre-cooler may comprise a separate device or may be incorporated as part of a condensing water heater. The heat and mass exchanger may use membranes having condensing sides and evaporating sides, which allow water to pass from the condensing sides to the evaporating sides. It may further comprise troughs for wetting the membranes.
