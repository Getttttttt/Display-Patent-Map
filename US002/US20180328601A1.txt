abstract
    The invention relates to a ventilation system (10) with heat recovery adsorber, the ventilation system (10) for being installed in buildings, wherein the ventilation system (10) furthermore comprises at least one exterior intake/outlet opening (11) for an air stream from outside of the building and at least one interior intake/outlet opening (23) for an air stream from inside the building, at least one air fan unit (14) and at least one filter unit (12, 22), wherein the heat recovery adsorber includes a heat exchange material (16) for absorbing and releasing heat from the air streams and a sorption material (18) for at least adsorbing and desorbing at least one sorbate from the air streams, wherein the at least one sorbate is water vapor, said sorption material (18) comprising at least one adsorbent for water vapor exhibiting an s-shaped water adsorption isotherm (30) at room temperature (25° C.+/−10° C.) with a steep increase in a narrow relative humidity range, wherein a main loading lift of the adsorbent for water vapor occurs in the relative humidity range from 0.1 to 0.5 and the saturation capacity of the adsorbent for water vapor lies in the range from 0.25 to 1.2 kgwater/kgadsorbent. The invention further relates to methods and uses for combined heat recovery, cooling/heating and dehumidifying/humidifying of air streams for buildings as well as such buildings.
