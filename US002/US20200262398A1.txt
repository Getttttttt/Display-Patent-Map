abstract
    A braking force controller causes a first actuator unit to generate a target jerk when the target jerk is equal to or larger than a first jerk, causes the first actuator unit to generate the first jerk and a second actuator unit to generate a jerk obtained by subtracting the first jerk from the target jerk as an additional jerk when the target jerk is smaller than the first jerk and equal to or larger than the sum of the first jerk and a second jerk, and causes the first actuator unit to generate the first jerk and the second actuator unit to generate the second jerk as the additional jerk when the target jerk is smaller than the sum of the first jerk and the second jerk.
