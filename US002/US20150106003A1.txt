abstract
    The subject invention is directed to a method and system for generating an improved fuel mileage value for a powered vehicle. Said method and system take into account real-time operational parameters of a vehicle, such as the rate of fuel consumption, vehicle velocity, vehicle acceleration and deceleration, the kinetic and potential energy of the vehicle, and the energy recovered by regenerative braking. In one set of applications, the improved fuel mileage value generated by said method and system provides timely and positive feedback and psychological reinforcement to vehicle operators to encourage fuel-efficient vehicle operations. Such feedback and psychological reinforcement are especially valuable when a regenerative vehicle braking system is being used. Said value can also provide feedback of the operational efficiency to an automated or semi-automated throttle and/or braking system.
