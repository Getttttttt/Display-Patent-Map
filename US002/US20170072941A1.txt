abstract
    A method of determining a regeneration schedule for a vehicle having an internal combustion engine, an electric machine, and a plurality of yaw rate actuators. The method includes determining an allowable yaw rate change based on dynamic conditions of the hybrid vehicle, a combined mitigation potential of the yaw rate actuators, and a regeneration torque command that causes an actual yaw rate change. Determining the regeneration torque command includes comparing the allowable yaw rate change to the combined mitigation potential. If the combined mitigation potential is less than the allowable yaw rate change, the regeneration torque command causes or limits the actual yaw rate change to be lower than the allowable yaw rate change. If the combined mitigation potential is greater than the allowable yaw rate change, the regeneration torque command causes or limits the actual yaw rate change to be substantially equal to the allowable yaw rate change.
