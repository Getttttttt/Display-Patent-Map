abstract
    A vehicle brake device is provided with: an acquisition unit that acquires travel resistance force produced between a vehicle wheel and a road surface touched by the wheel when, for example, a vehicle having the wheel travels, on the basis of driving force of the vehicle and acceleration of the vehicle; and a control unit that starts a control for supplying braking force to the wheel of the vehicle when a difference between the travel resistance force and a predetermined value exceeds a first threshold value and a differential value of the travel resistance force exceeds a second threshold value.
