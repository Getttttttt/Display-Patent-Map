abstract
    A floor scrubber cleaning system includes a combustion engine powered floor scrubber using at least one rotating scrubbing brush. A tank or reservoir is sued for supplying a cleaning solution to the scrubbing brush for cleaning a floor. A heat exchanger uses hot exhaust gasses from the combustion engine to heat the cleaning solution where it is dispensed directly onto the floor.
