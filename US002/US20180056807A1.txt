abstract
    A method for controlling an output of an LDC in an environmentally friendly vehicle is provided. The method includes determining whether the vehicle travels in the regenerative braking mode and when the vehicle does, transmitting a first slope signal to the LDC to increase an output voltage of the LDC that charges or discharges an auxiliary battery supplying power to an electric load using a high voltage battery. The first slope signal determines an upward slope of the output voltage of the LDC according to time as a first slope. When the vehicle does not travel in the regenerative braking mode and uses a high power electric load a second slope signal is transmitted to the LDC to increase the output voltage of the LDC. The second slope signal determines the upward slope as the second slope having a slope less than the first slope.
