abstract
    A balance correcting circuit is prevented from moving charges from a low-voltage electricity storage cell to a high-voltage electricity storage cell in a electricity storage system. The balance correcting circuit includes an inductor, a first switching device, a second switching device, and a control signal generating unit that supplies a control signal to the first and second switching devices to turn on and off the first and second switching devices so that the first switching device and the second switching device are alternately turned on and off. The control signal generating unit stops generating the control signal when receiving a state transition signal indicating that the electricity storage system transitions to and temporarily stays in a charging state while the electricity storage system is operating.
