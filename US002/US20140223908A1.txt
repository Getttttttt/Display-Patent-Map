abstract
    A system and method of integrated waste management having a source of a combustible waste material, a separator for separating the combustible waste material from a recyclable material, an airless drier for drying the combustible waste material to generate a pyrolysis feedstock, and a pyrolyser for pyrolysing the pyrolysis feedstock to form char and pyrogas. The system and method for power generation may also use an oxidiser for the high-temperature oxidation of syngas generated from the pyrolysis feedstock to generate heat for power production.
