abstract
    Integrated systems and processes are provided for drying and milling sludge and other natural waste using waste heat extracted from reheated gas through an air-air heat exchanger process. In one example, the sludge or natural waste may be dried into a powder using high-temperature gas to absorb moisture from the sludge, causing the high-temperature gas to become an at least partially saturated gas. The at least partially saturated gas may pass through a separator- scrubber cycle before a first portion is heated in an air-heater and then used to heat a second portion of the at least partially saturated gas in an air-air heat exchanger. The heat for the air-heater may be provided by a burner operable to burn the dried powder obtained from the sludge. The heated second portion of gas may be used to dry and mill the sludge and other natural waste.
