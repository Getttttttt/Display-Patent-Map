abstract
    Envisaged is an exhaust gas heat recovery system comprising a heat pump, a mixer and a flow regulating means. The heat pump is configured to pump heat from a refrigerant. The heat pump has an inlet and an outlet wherein the exhaust gas stream leaving the outlet is split into two streams: a stream rejected to atmosphere and a recirculating exhaust stream re-circulated back to the heat pump. The mixer is provided at the inlet of the heat pump to mix an inlet exhaust stream with the recirculating exhaust gas stream to get a resultant exhaust stream at an intermediate temperature of the two streams. The flow regulating means is adapted to compress the recirculating exhaust stream.
