abstract
    The invention is directed to a process to obtain a compressed gas starting from a starting gas having a lower pressure by performing the following steps: (i) increasing the pressure and temperature of a gas having an intermediate pressure by means of indirect heat exchange against a fluid having a higher temperature to obtain a gas high in pressure and temperature, (ii) obtaining part of the gas high in temperature and pressure as the compressed gas, (iii) using another part of the gas high in temperature and pressure as a driving gas to increase the pressure of the starting gas in one or more stages to obtain the gas having an intermediate pressure for use in step (i). The invention is also directed to a configuration wherein the process can be performed and directed to a process to generate energy using the process.
