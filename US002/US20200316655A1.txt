abstract
    A liquid heating apparatus includes a top portion with a burner unit, a coil, an external housing, and an internal housing. The burner unit is arranged to burn a fuel so as to generate a downward directed flame. The coil includes first and second layers of windings. The internal housing is arranged within the external housing. The apparatus is in a substantially upright position during operation. A compartment between the internal housing and the external serves as a first liquid reservoir. The flame from the burner unit is peripherally contained by an inner part of the first layer of windings of the coil. The first layer of windings is configured to direct the flame or exhaust gases downwards. The flame or exhaust gases are redirected such that the they contact all of the second layer of windings, the internal housing inner wall, and the first layer of windings
