abstract
    A in-vehicle coffee maker assembly for brewing a cup of coffee in a vehicle includes a vehicle that has an internal combustion engine. A water reservoir is coupled to the vehicle and the water reservoir is positioned in an engine compartment of the vehicle. The water reservoir contains potable water and the water reservoir is in thermal communication with the internal combustion engine. Thus, the internal combustion engine heats the potable water in the water reservoir when the internal combustion engine is running. A coffee maker is integrated into the vehicle. The coffee maker is in fluid communication with the water reservoir such that the coffee maker receives the potable water for brewing coffee.
