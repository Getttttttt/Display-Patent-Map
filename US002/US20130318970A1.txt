abstract
    A method and a configuration recover thermal energy in a thermal treatment of cold-rolled steel strip in an annealing furnace. The steel strip is heated up in a protective gas atmosphere to a temperature above the recrystallization temperature, and is subjected in a first, slow cooling phase and a second, fast cooling phase to a protective gas. The temperature of the protective gas is reduced during the first phase down to an intermediate temperature and in the second phase from the intermediate temperature to a final temperature. A first heat exchanger transfers the thermal energy of the protective gas by an oil circuit and a second heat exchanger to a working medium, and which evaporates and is fed to a steam motor, which converts the thermal energy contained in the working medium into energy.
