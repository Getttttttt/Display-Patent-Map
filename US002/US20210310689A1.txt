abstract
    The present disclosed subject matter relates to energy efficiency improvements in compressed air systems and methods to implement them. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, improving the efficiency is performed by recovering the “wasted energy” in the compressed air and/or condensed water energy streams produced by the compressor and the cooling drying process.
