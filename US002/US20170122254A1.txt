abstract
    An internal combustion engine heat energy recovery system (1) comprises a first heat exchanger (20) arranged in heat communication with at least one heat energy source of an internal combustion engine (10) and with a working fluid of the system (1) for the transfer of heat energy from the heat energy source to the working fluid of the system (1). A turbine (30) is arranged in fluid communication with the working fluid heated in the first heat exchanger (20) for the expansion of the working fluid to produce shaft power. A second heat exchanger (40) is arranged in heat communication with the expanded working fluid to remove waste heat therefrom and transfer it to an external source such as the atmosphere. A first compressor (50) is arranged in fluid communication with the working fluid exiting the heat exchanger for increasing the pressure of the cooled working fluid prior to its entry into the first heat exchanger (20). The working fluid of the system is a substantially supercritical fluid.
