abstract
    A networking apparatus couples a plurality of vehicle nodes to improve bandwidth, security, and subsystem independence. The networking apparatus couples a plurality of thin client units to a single virtualized master control unit container host. Each thin client unit transforms CAN protocol messages to encrypted packets for a real time Ethernet interconnect. Vehicle subsystem modules connect via a personalized thin client unit which will filter, correct, and authenticate messages at the periphery of the networking apparatus. Between thin client units, the host encrypts and decrypts a message, directs the message to the proper recipient, authenticates each message, and centrally provides the functionality of a plurality of electronic control units. The virtualized master control unit container host may be updated over the air and perform installation and validation checks of a new version of one or more electronic control unit images while the vehicle is in operation using a previous version.
