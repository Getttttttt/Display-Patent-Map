abstract
    Certain aspects of a natural gas liquid fractionation plant waste heat conversion to power using Organic Rankine Cycle can be implemented as a system. The system includes a heating fluid circuit thermally coupled to multiple heat sources of a natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionation plant. The system includes a power generation system that includes an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), which includes (i) a working fluid that is thermally coupled to the heating fluid circuit to heat the working fluid, and (ii) an expander configured to generate electrical power from the heated working fluid. The system includes a control system configured to actuate a set of control valves to selectively thermally couple the heating fluid circuit to at least a portion of the multiple heat sources of the NGL fractionation plant.
