abstract
    A fluid channel formed with generally triangular-shaped performance enhancement features is disclosed. The fluid channels may be incorporated into heat exchanger or humidifier devices, the performance enhancement features generally having heat transfer and/or mass transfer performance enhancement applications. The heat transfer or mass transfer enhancement features are formed along the inner surfaces of the fluid flow passages of either the heat exchanger or humidifier plates and generally have sharp leading edges that create vortices in the fluid flowing through the passages. The heat or mass transfer enhancements protrude out of the inner surface of the fluid flow passages while leaving the outer surface of the fluid channel free of perforations. Alternatively, heat or mass transfer enhancements may be formed on separate inserts that are affixed to the inner surface of the fluid flow passages. The heat or mass transfer enhancements can be formed in metal plates or plastic plates using a variety of manufacturing techniques.
