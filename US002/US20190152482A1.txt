abstract
    Brake force distribution via a combination of mechanical braking and regenerative braking techniques is described. In an example, a brake system of a vehicle can detect a braking action and can cause a first negative force to be distributed across two or more wheel assemblies associated with the vehicle. A control system of the vehicle can send a command to at least a power system of the vehicle to cause the power system to affect a second negative force on a first wheel assembly and a positive force on a second wheel assembly to cause an uneven distribution of brake force between the first wheel assembly and the second wheel assembly. As a result, a combined net braking force is applied to the front wheels—the wheels with the most grip—and a reduced net braking force to is applied to the rear wheels to prevent rear-wheel lock-up.
