abstract
    A system and method for power generation and/or distribution and for providing air conditioning is disclosed, that is particularly suitable for localized consumption. Power generation includes a combined cooling, heating and power system (CCHP) containing a gas or liquid fueled internal combustion engine with a generator and heat recovery system for providing electrical power and heat for local consumption. The CCHP system includes an integrated cooling system for cooling a local environment, using either vapor compression and/or heat pump and/or evaporative cooling technology. The CCHP system also contains an energy management unit allowing CCHP system and local area electrical needs in whole or in part to be powered by either the CCHP generator and/or a communal electrical grid and/or renewable energy sources and/or a battery storage network.
