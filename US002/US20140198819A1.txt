abstract
    A method of recovering energy from an electric induction furnace exhaust gas in the gasification of feed fuel to exhaust gas. Melt of an electrically conductive material, which is disposed within electric induction furnace, is pressurized while substantially sealing the electric induction furnace to enable the build-up of a superatmospheric pressure in said furnace. A feed fuel is injected into contact with at least a portion of the melt of electrically conductive material. Exhaust gas generated at a superatmospheric pressure is withdrawn from said furnace and scrubbed and stored for subsequent use in a gas accumulator. The total calorific value of the exhaust gas from the gas accumulator that is available for use by a gas consumer device is measured and estimated. An input of feed fuel, of auxiliary gases and of heating power to the electric induction furnace is adjusted such that the estimated total calorific value of exhaust gas is kept between a pre-determined upper and a pre-determined lower threshold by using an adjustable controller unit that comprises a PD controller. A gas consumer device is fed with the exhaust gas from the accumulator independently of the blowing periods. The electric induction furnace exhaust gas is maintained under superatmospheric pressure during the blowing, withdrawing, scrubbing and storing steps without recompression.
