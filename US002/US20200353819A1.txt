abstract
    A brake force control apparatus allocates all of required brake force to a target front wheel friction brake force when the required brake force is equal to or smaller than a maximum regeneration brake force. The apparatus decreases the target regeneration brake force by a first predetermined amount at a first time point at which a front wheel acceleration varies from a value larger than a first acceleration threshold to a value equal to or smaller than the first acceleration threshold. The apparatus increases the target regeneration brake force in such a manner that the target regeneration brake force coincides with the required brake force, if the front wheel acceleration becomes larger than a second acceleration threshold in a period from the first time point to a second time point at which a predetermined time elapses from the first time point.
