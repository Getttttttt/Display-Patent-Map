abstract
    A method and a corresponding plant for denitrifying bypass exhaust gases in a cement clinker production plant. Raw meal is sintered in a rotary kiln and deacidified in a calciner. A rotary kiln inlet chamber is connected to the calciner directly or by a riser duct. Bypass exhaust gas is drawn off near the inlet chamber. This exhaust gas is guided into a first mixing chamber, in which the exhaust gas is cooled to between 800 and 950 degrees C., then the exhaust gas is guided through a reaction pipeline segment, wherein the dwell time is between 0.5 and 3 seconds and ammonia, aqueous ammonia solution, or ammonia-releasing substances are injected for denitrification. Then the exhaust gas is guided into a second mixing chamber, in which the exhaust gas is cooled to between 150 250 degrees C. Then the exhaust gas is guided to a filter for dust removal.
