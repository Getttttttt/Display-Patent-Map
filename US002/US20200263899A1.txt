abstract
    A heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) unit may include a supply fan section having a supply fan disposed therein to force a supply air flow through a discharge plenum of the HVAC unit. The HVAC unit may also include an economizer positioned adjacent the supply fan section to receive an outdoor air flow and direct the outdoor air flow into the supply fan section.
