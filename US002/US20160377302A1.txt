abstract
    Provided are flexible panel devices that use desiccants for heat and mass transfer processes, including but not limited to air conditioning systems, for example, liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) applications wherein the liquid desiccant is contained in a panel that comprises at least one hydrophilic separation layer, which allows water vapor transfer between the air and liquid desiccant and enable dehumidification and humidification of the air. The flexible panel devices can be installed on an absorber (conditioner) side or a desorber (regenerator) side or both of a LDAC system. The devices have two flexible layers, at least one of which comprises a flexible and water vapor permeable hydrophilic separation layer, that form a desiccant flow channel and a desiccant flow distributor located therein. The two flexible layers may both be permeable hydropholic separation layers, or they may comprise one permeable hydrophilic separation layer along with another layer that may be a non-porous structure or a water-vapor permeable hydrophobic separation layer.
