abstract
    A method and a device for conversion of energy are proposed, in which a hydrocarbon-containing energy source is burned in a combustion space (12) in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere and the generated heat is transmitted to a steam power plant circuit (60). Flue gas (104), which is formed in the combustion of the hydrocarbon-containing energy source, is cooled in a direct-contact cooler (20) in direct contact with a water-containing coolant flow (138).
