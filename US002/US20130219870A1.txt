abstract
    A technique is described including receiving a hydrocarbon stream, and heating the hydrocarbon stream with an exhaust steam from an internal combustion engine. This technique may include reacting the hydrocarbon stream catalytically to produce hydrogen and a modified hydrocarbon stream having a lower saturation state than the hydrocarbon stream, recovering energy from the hydrogen stream, and/or providing the modified hydrocarbon stream to a fuel supply for the internal combustion engine.
