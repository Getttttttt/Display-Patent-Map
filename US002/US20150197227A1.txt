abstract
    A vehicle regenerative braking control system includes a brake pedal; a brake pedal angle sensor interfacing with the brake pedal; a vehicle braking system interfacing with the brake pedal angle sensor, the vehicle braking system adapted to implement friction braking and regenerative braking responsive to receiving a brake pedal angle input signal from the brake pedal angle sensor; and at least one of a brake pedal switch and a brake master cylinder pressure sensor interfacing with the brake pedal and the vehicle braking system. The vehicle braking system is further adapted to implement friction braking and regenerative braking responsive to input from the at least one of a brake pedal switch and a brake master cylinder pressure sensor in the event that the vehicle braking system does not receive the brake pedal angle input signal from the brake pedal angle sensor. A regenerative braking control method is also disclosed.
