abstract
    A gas turbine has a compressor, a central housing, at least one combustion chamber, an expansion turbine, and a heat exchanger. Each combustion chamber is fluidically connected to the expansion turbine via an inner housing which is guided through the interior of the central housing. The compressor is fluidically separated from the interior of the central housing by an annular collection chamber connected to an outlet of the compressor and which has a number of discharge lines which are connected to the cold side of the heat exchanger during operation. Each combustion chamber is designed as a silo combustion chamber, and each silo combustion chamber has an inner wall, which delimits a combustion chamber, and an outer wall, and the outer wall surrounds the inner wall, thereby forming a cavity. The inner wall transitions into the inner housing, and the cavity transitions into the interior of the central housing.
