abstract
    A device for a hydraulic braking system of a vehicle. The device includes a processing unit, which is programmed to determine at least one brake characteristic value of the hydraulic braking system, the processing unit being programmed to determine the at least one brake characteristic value as a vehicle axle-specific brake characteristic value, which in each case corresponds to a ratio between a brake pressure in all wheel brake cylinders assigned to a shared vehicle axle of the vehicle and a vehicle axle braking torque exerted on the shared vehicle axle with the aid of the wheel brake cylinders. A method for determining at least one brake characteristic value of a hydraulic braking system of a vehicle, and a method for decelerating a vehicle with a hydraulic braking system and an electric motor usable as a generator, are also described.
