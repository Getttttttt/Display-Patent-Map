abstract
    A method of cooling a gas fueled engine driven intercooled air compressor comprises providing the intercooled air compressor, a gearbox, and the gas fueled engine. The method includes flowing a liquid coolant from a liquid coolant supply to each of the gearbox and an intercooler of the intercooled air compressor. The method comprises recombining the liquid coolant after the gearbox and the intercooler. The method includes directing the recombined liquid coolant via multiple paths to cool the gas fueled engine. The method comprises recombining the liquid coolant after the liquid coolant has passed through the multiple paths.
