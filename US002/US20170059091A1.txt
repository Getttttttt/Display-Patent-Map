abstract
    Disclosed are processes in which the pressure of a dense phase fluid stream containing hydrocarbons is reduced to produce a two-phase fluid stream, and energy is recovered. The process includes passing the dense phase fluid stream at a pressure greater than the cricondenbar pressure of the dense phase fluid stream through an expander where the dense phase fluid stream is expanded isentropically such that a two phase fluid stream having a pressure lower than the pressure of the dense phase fluid stream leaves the expander. The expander is coupled to a rotating mechanical power user, such that the expander drives the rotating mechanical power user. The process further includes passing the two phase fluid stream leaving the expander to a separator such that the two phase fluid stream is separated into a vapor phase stream and a liquid phase stream. The composition or quantity of liquid formed can be adjusted to control the dew point of the gas produced from the dense-phase fluid.
