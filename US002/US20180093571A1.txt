abstract
    A braking control method and device for a vehicle are disclosed. According to certain embodiments, the device may include a controller configured to: detect a panic braking event initiated by a user; activate regenerative braking to decelerate the vehicle; monitor an amount of friction braking generated by a friction braking system of the vehicle; monitor rotational speeds of one or more wheels of the vehicle; and adjust an amount of the regenerative braking based on the amount of the friction braking and the rotational speeds of the one or more wheels. The device may further include at least one actuator for applying the adjusted amount of the regenerative braking.
