abstract
    A combined cycle turbine plant having at least one gas turbine, a steam turbine and at least one waste heat steam generator. The waste heat steam generator has at least one condensate pre-heater into which a condensate line discharges, and has a feed water pre-heater which is connected upstream of the condensate pre-heater in the flow direction of a gas turbine flue gas and upstream of which, on the feed water side, there is connected a feed water pump, and which is connected to a fuel preheating unit for the gas turbine. From the fuel preheating unit a line for cooled feed water discharges into a motive medium inlet of a jet pump of which the suction medium inlet is connected to an outlet of the condensate pre-heater and of which the outlet is connected to the condensate line. A corresponding method recirculates condensate in a combined cycle turbine plant.
