abstract
    A reduction device, an acid gas recovery device, a recovery device collector, and a first removed substance returning line are provided. The reduction device is configured to perform a reduction process to turn iron oxide to reduced iron by adding a reducing agent. The acid gas recovery device is configured to recover CO2 being acid gas with CO2 absorbing liquid being acid gas absorbing liquid from exhaust gas containing at least powder-shaped iron-based solid substances and the acid gas, which are discharged from the reduction device. The recovery device collector is configured to collect the iron-based solid substance contained in the absorbing liquid with a filter. The iron-based solid substances collected by the recovery device collector are removed, and removed substances containing the removed iron-based solid substances are returned to the reduction device side through the first removed substance returning line.
