abstract
    An antiskid controller for controlling braking operation of a wheel of a vehicle based on an output signal provided by a wheel speed sensor coupled to the wheel may comprise a delay toggle, a switch logic for switching between an initial rate and a running rate, and a linear control used for calculating an antiskid correction signal, wherein the linear control receives one of the initial rate and the running rate, depending on a state of the switch logic. The linear control receives the initial rate upon initialization of the antiskid controller. The linear control receives the running rate after a predetermined duration or after the linear control has converged on a desired solution.
