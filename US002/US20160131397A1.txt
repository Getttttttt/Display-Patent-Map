abstract
    A condensing gas-fired furnace has a furnace cabinet, a primary heat exchanger, a secondary heat exchanger located upstream relative to the primary heat exchanger with regard to location within a circulation airflow path, a first baffle carried by a first wall of the furnace cabinet, and a second baffle carried by a second wall of the furnace cabinet, wherein the second baffle is located opposite the first baffle, and wherein the second wall is located opposite the first wall. The first baffle and the second baffle cooperate to form a nozzle within the furnace cabinet. A third baffle and a fourth baffle extend from the bottom of the first baffle and the second baffle, respectively, to the blower deck located adjacent to a secondary heat exchanger.
