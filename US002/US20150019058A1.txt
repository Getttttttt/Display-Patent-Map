abstract
    The invention relates to a self-learning regenerative control system that adapts to the user's driving style. The system receives as input a signal that is indicative of the friction brake usage and adapts the degree of regenerative braking accordingly. When the friction brake usage is high, the system will make the regenerative braking more aggressive such that when the user lifts-off the foot from the accelerator pedal, the degree of regenerative braking will be higher, thus reducing the need to use friction brakes. The system continuously adapts the regenerative braking intensity based on driving style, road conditions, etc.
