abstract
    A heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system includes a furnace having a primary heat exchanger and a secondary heat exchanger, where the primary heat exchanger and the secondary heat exchanger form a heat exchange relationship between an airflow and an exhaust gas, and where the primary heat exchanger is positioned upstream of the secondary heat exchanger, a burner configured to generate the exhaust gas, a sensor configured to monitor an ambient temperature, and a control system configured to receive feedback from the sensor, compare the feedback to a threshold, operate the furnace in a first mode when the ambient temperature exceeds the threshold, and operate the furnace in a second mode when the ambient temperature is at or below the threshold, where the furnace operates above a condensation temperature when in the second mode, such that the exhaust gas does not condense when operating in the second mode.
