abstract
    An electronic control unit of a braking force control apparatus for a vehicle activates, as a first state, in-wheel motors in a regeneration state, thereby generating motor braking torques, and causes friction brake mechanisms to generate friction braking forces. Moreover, the unit activates, as a second state, the motors in a power running state, thereby generating motor driving torques, and causes the mechanisms to generate friction braking forces. Then, when the state is caused to transition between the first state and the second state, the unit changes magnitudes of the braking torques or the driving torques generated by the motors to one of increase and decrease, and changes magnitudes of the friction braking forces generated by the mechanisms to one of increase and decrease.
