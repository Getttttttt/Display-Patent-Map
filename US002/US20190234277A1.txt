abstract
    A fluid flow network for a vehicle includes first and second flow ducts having a common inlet and a common outlet; a flow directing member movable about a first axis and configured to direct flow from the common inlet to at least one of the first and second flow ducts; a flow reactive member configured to detect an imbalance between the flow exiting the first flow duct and the flow exiting the second flow duct; and means for adjusting the position of the flow directing member if an imbalance is detected by the flow reactive member.
