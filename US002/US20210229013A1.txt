abstract
    A water extractor includes a plurality of layers of low pressure zones and a plurality of channels of high pressure zones. The low pressure zone layers alternate, in a radial direction, with the high pressure zone channels. At least one of the low pressure zones is configured to enable a flow to enter, from at least one high pressure zone, to at least one low pressure zone.
