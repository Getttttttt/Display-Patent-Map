abstract
    A control device for a vehicle regenerative braking system, having an engine control device, with which a setpoint engine braking torque variable for a setpoint engine braking torque to be imparted by an electric motor, useable in generator mode, is defineable, considering a setpoint overall braking torque variable for a predefined setpoint overall braking torque, and considering an actual friction braking torque variable for an imparted/impartable actual friction braking torque of at least one additional friction brake, wherein if the setpoint variable is below a threshold, the setpoint variable is defineable according to a difference between the setpoint overall braking torque to be imparted and the imparted/impartable braking torque, and if the setpoint variable is above the threshold, the setpoint variable is defineable according to a sum of a predefined additional braking torque and the difference. Also described are a regenerative braking system and method.
