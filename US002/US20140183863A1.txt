abstract
    A novel heat exchange device to provide sufficient amounts of heat within a manifold including a working fluid within heating coils to generate electricity through an external combustion steam engine and electrical generator is provided. Such a novel heat exchanger includes coils that surround a central heating compartment thereby exposing such coils to gradually increasing temperatures such that the working fluid is first vaporized and then is ultimately superheated to a “dry” steam upon the point of egress of the heat exchanger leading to the engine portion. In this manner, greater efficiency in heating of the working fluid is accomplished with all of the fluid converted to a gas under pressure to effectuate the necessary engine, etc., movement for energy production.
