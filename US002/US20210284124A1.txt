abstract
    A method for controlling the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle, where the vehicle has a friction brake system brakes, a drive system with an electromotive drive acting on at least one wheel, and a battery for supplying power to the electromotive drive determines state information which describes the state of the vehicle and/or the state of the brake system and/or of the drive system. Route information is determined which describes the route profile of the vehicle. An action plan for implementing a future braking request by the friction brakes and/or the electromotive drive on the basis of the state information and the route information is determined. The action plan specifies, for future times and/or areas on the route, whether a braking request of the vehicle is to be implemented by means of the friction brake and/or the drive system and implements a braking request accordingly.
