abstract
    In an ORC energy converter with parallel preheaters and evaporators different waste heat streams of an internal combustion engine are utilized with parallel evaporators in a common ORC energy converter. The ORC energy converter with parallel evaporators has the same working fluid for each evaporator and the working fluid is separated after the pre-feed system or the feed system and the flows are mixed after the evaporators or at the condenser inlet. Also the working fluid sides of the evaporators can be combined so that only the heat source sides are separated.
