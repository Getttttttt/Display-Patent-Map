abstract
    A railroad powered energy cogeneration system and method comprising a plurality of air compressor hoses, a plurality of manifold pipelines, at least one manifold pipeline check valve, a pneumatic air filter, a pneumatic motor-generator set, and a pressure control valve, wherein the plurality of manifold pipelines is configured to connect each of the plurality of air compressor hoses attached to an inner side of each of the rails of an existing railroad system. The plurality of air compressor hoses produces compressed air when a train traverses over them. The at least one manifold pipeline check valve is configured to assure unidirectional air flow through the plurality of manifold pipelines. The pneumatic motor-generator set converts compressed air into electricity and the remaining compressed air is stored in the storage vault and/or other storage means described.
