abstract
    A modular electric truck system provides an electric truck that has a scalable chassis that can be equipped with interchangeable modular body components that detachably attach to the truck chassis to change the appearance and functionality of the electric truck. An interior cabin comprises furniture, lighting elements, computer devices, and entertainment systems. The driver sits in a center driving position where visibility and positional awareness is enhanced. The electric truck is 100% electrical; and thereby provides convenient electrical charging means for the truck through a charging trailer that attaches to the truck, and/or at least one solar panel on the roof, bed, or trailer of the truck. The solar panel charges a battery that operatively connects to a hub motor in the wheels. A remote control system remotely controls at least one trailer. The trailer may be tethered, wireless, or autonomous to wirelessly track and follow the truck.
