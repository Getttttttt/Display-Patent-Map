abstract
    A hydronic space heating system including a buffer tank defining upper and lower chambers in fluid and thermal communication with one another, the upper and lower chambers being separated by a baffle having passages formed therein to allow fluid flow from the lower chamber to the upper chamber to facilitate heat transfer therebetween in a controlled manner, a heat pump associated with the lower chamber of the buffer tank and having an output for heating water in the lower chamber of the buffer tank to a temperature within a predefined temperature range, and an auxiliary heat source associated with the upper chamber of the buffer tank having an output for increasing the temperature of water in the upper chamber of the buffer tank to conditionally supplement the output of the heat pump.
