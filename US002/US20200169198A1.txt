abstract
    A motor control device includes: a storage configured to store reference Lissajous values; and a controller configured to apply an excitation signal to a resolver; receive an output signal output from the resolver, to obtain a Lissajous value corresponding to the received output signal, to determine that an external noise is input when the obtained Lissajous value is different from the reference Lissajous values, and to control driving of a motor based on the obtained Lissajous value when the obtained Lissajous value is equal to any one of the reference Lissajous values. A vehicle having the motor control device may further include a battery configured to transmit power to the motor and to be charged by regenerative braking of the motor.
