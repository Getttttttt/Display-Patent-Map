abstract
    An exhaust gas heat recovery system for a vehicle is configured to selectively distribute a fluid heated by engine exhaust to a first path for generating electricity and a second path for heating one or more powertrain components of the vehicle. A controller selects a distribution of the fluid to the first and second paths based on minimizing a fuel consumption of an engine. The controller further selects a distribution of fluid to the powertrain components to minimize fuel consumption. The controller distributes the fluid according to the selected distribution.
