abstract
    A system includes a rotary electric machine, wiring, a battery that is connected to the rotary electric machine by the wiring harness, and an upper limit value setting section which sets an output upper limit value that is an upper limit of an output command of the rotary electric machine. A control apparatus which controls the rotary electric machine is provided with a temperature acquisition section which acquires the temperature of at least one of the battery and the wiring, an allowable output value calculation section which calculates an allowable output value that is an upper limit allowed for an output command of the rotary electric machine, based on the temperature that is acquired by the temperature acquisition section, and a transmitting section which transmits the allowable output value calculated by the allowable value calculation section to the upper limit value setting section.
