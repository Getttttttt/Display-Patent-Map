abstract
    A hybrid vehicle has a drive comprising an internal combustion engine, has an energy converter comprising an electric machine that can be operated for recuperation purposes, and has a control unit that is operatively connected to an operating element, to the drive and to the energy converter. The hybrid vehicle glides when the drive is not in the propulsion mode of operation and with an electric motor operated in a recuperation intensity stage in a first drive state. Based on the control unit having made the determination that the operating element was actuated, the determination is made in the control unit as to whether a condition is present, whereby the duration of the actuation of the operating element is determined and it is determined in a comparison that the duration is below the time threshold value. If the condition is present, a changeover is made from the first drive state to a second drive state in which the hybrid vehicle is then operated.
