abstract
    A regenerative braking control apparatus includes an interface unit configured to receive driving information of a vehicle; an object detection device configured to generate object information based on detecting an object outside the vehicle; and at least one processor. The at least one processor is configured to: determine whether to perform regenerative braking for the vehicle, based on the driving information and the object information; and provide at least one signal corresponding to a result of determining whether to perform the regenerative braking for the vehicle.
