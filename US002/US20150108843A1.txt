abstract
    An improved control arrangement is used in a high power rectifier and comprises two or more power controllers ganged together in parallel. Each power controller rectifies an AC voltage signal using zero voltage crossing switching to produce a binary switched signal and each power controller is connected to an independent connectable load. Each power controller includes a fast acting binary power switch that selectively connects the respective independent connectable load to the rectified AC voltage signal. The control arrangement selectively activates the power controllers to define a desired connected load. This high power rectifier and control arrangement is advantageously used to provide fast up down power regulation to a grid by selective storage of thermal energy and deriving power from the thermal energy storage system to add fill in power to the grid.
