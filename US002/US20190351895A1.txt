abstract
    A vehicle, integrated all-wheel propulsion and steering system with plurality of propulsion and steering power sources, designed with enumerate specifications are coupled to, and de-coupled from a final drive of the vehicle propulsion system. A controller receives input-signals from the driver steering-wheel sensor; computes a set of reactions to the plurality of steering-actuators, wherein feedback-mechanism with each wheel-position sensor, the controller secures each wheel in its computed angle. In different speed and load conditions, the controller is programmed to compute a desired power demand then couple to the final drive[s] the propulsion power source[s] that is designed to do-the-job with the least energy consumption. When the vehicle changes speed and load, the controller couples a different power source[s], and de-couples the previous power source[s] to meet the power demand. In turning-modes, whilst positioning every wheel in its computed position, the controller computes the different distances the left and the right wheels of the vehicle have to travel, wherein the controller moves-up the propulsion power sources velocity to the wheels opposite to the turn to make a perfect turn without EPS assistance.
