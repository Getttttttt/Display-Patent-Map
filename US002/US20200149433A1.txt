abstract
    The present application relates to an exhaust steam waste heat recovering and supplying system used for air-cooling units in large thermal power plants. Each of the two steam turbines has independent exhaust steam extraction system, and the exhaust steam extraction system of each steam turbine is connected with corresponding pre-condenser to heat the return water of the heating network. The exhaust steam extraction system of each steam turbine is further connected with the corresponding steam ejector; the exhaust port of each steam is connected with the corresponding steam ejector condenser to heat the return water of the heating network. The exhaust steam waste heat of the air-cooling units in a thermal power plant can be recycled in high efficiency to improve the utility rate of the exhaust steam, increase heating capacity, reduce cold end loss to the largest extent, and maximize the energy saving benefits.
