abstract
    A piping apparatus includes an exhaust pipe providing a passage through which the exhaust gas discharged, and a harmful gas treatment device positioned between a rear end of the vacuum pump and a front end of the exhaust pipe or positioned on the exhaust pipe, wherein the harmful gas treatment device includes a heating means for increasing the temperature of the exhaust gas so as to prevent a sublimable component, from among components included in the exhaust gas, from being sublimated and accumulated inside the exhaust pipe, and the heating means is positioned on a section including a sublimation condition occurrence point, at which a sublimation condition of the sublimable component occurs, and an upstream side of the sublimation condition occurrence point on the exhaust pipe, and the sublimation condition is a temperature condition for the pressure of the sublimable component.
