abstract
    A vehicle control apparatus is a vehicle control apparatus controlling a vehicle and provided with a regenerative device generating electric power while applying a regenerative braking force by performing regenerative electric power generation, an electric power supply capable of exchanging electric power with the regenerative device, and a hydraulic device applying a hydraulic braking force attributable to a hydraulic pressure, and is provided with an electronic control device controlling the regenerative device and the hydraulic device so as to adjust the ratios of the regenerative braking force and the hydraulic braking force to a required braking force required for the braking of the vehicle based on an input electric power value input into the electric power supply.
