abstract
    In a heating and hot water supply apparatus, a heat exchanger for hot water supply includes a primary-side path and a secondary-side path. A bypass path branches from a heating circulation path and is configured such that a heat transfer medium heated by a heating device flows through the primary-side path without passing through a heating terminal when hot water supply operation is performed and then joins the heating circulation path again. A control unit controls a flow rate regulating valve so that a hot water flow rate does not exceed a reference limit flow rate when hot water supply operation is performed. The reference limit flow rate is set on the basis of the smaller one between a maximum heating capacity of the heating device and a heating capacity of the heating device at which an output temperature of the heated heat transfer medium reaches an upper limit temperature.
