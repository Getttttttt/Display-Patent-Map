abstract
    A braking system is disclosed. The braking system may include a controller configured to determine a speed threshold that is based on a deceleration of an output speed of a powertrain of a machine caused in part by engagement of one or more brakes of the machine during a directional shift in a movement of the machine, the speed threshold being the output speed of the powertrain at which the one or more brakes are to be commanded to disengage. The controller may be configured to command disengagement of the one or more brakes based on a determination that the output speed of the powertrain satisfies the speed threshold.
