abstract
    The invention relates to a method and apparatus for low temperature waste heat utilization. In the scope of the hot water plant (HWP) there are few low temperature sources, which cannot be used by heat consumer (HC) directly. The method and apparatus for hot water power plant (HWP) waste heat recovery comprises at least one, preferably condensing type heat exchanger (HE), which collects the waste heat for water source high temperature heat pump (HP) employment, wherein a low temperature heat is upgraded to a high temperature heat, hence heat pump (HP) hot water outlet is fed to the boiler in a return line or in a supply line of hot water plant (HWP), wherein the thermal energy balance adjustment of generated heat is executed by adapting the power of said heat pump (HP) and/or by adapting the power of said furnace and/or by adapting the mass flow of the primary heat transfer medium in at least one open loop heating network and/or in at least one closed loop heating circuit in the scope of heat distribution network.
