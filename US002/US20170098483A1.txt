abstract
    The present invention discloses a heat exchange system and a nuclear reactor system. The heat exchange system includes: a heating device; a heat consuming device connected with the heating device through a pipe to form a loop; and a steam, which is in a wet steam state before being supplied to a heat source, and is supplied to the heat consuming device after becoming dry steam or superheated steam by exchanging heat with the heating device. Heat exchange efficiency and security of the nuclear reactor system are improved by adopting steam as a heat exchange medium.
