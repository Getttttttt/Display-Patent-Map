abstract
    An electric motor bicycle system with an electric motor driven gear adapted to drive a wheel gear coupled to a bicycle hub. The motor driven gear is coupled to the wheel gear with a chain. The chain may be tensioned with one or more tensioners, which allow for a tighter system geometry. The motor may be supported with a bracket adapted to mount to industry standard disc brake mounting interfaces. In some aspects, the motor driven gear is coupled to the disc mounting interface of a wheel hub. In some aspects, the electric motor bicycle system may also have a disc brake system integrated therein.
