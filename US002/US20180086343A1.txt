abstract
    Vehicles including a plurality of front and rear ground engaging members, a front driveline operatively coupled to a first power source, a rear driveline operatively coupled to a second power source, at least one controller operatively coupled to the first drive system and the second drive system are disclosed. The vehicles may further include a torque request input adapted to be actuatable by an operator of the vehicle. The torque request input may provide an indication of a requested torque to the at least one controller. The at least one controller may, based on the requested torque, command a first output of the first drive system to the at least one front ground engaging member and a second output of the second drive system to the at least one rear ground engaging member. Vehicle drive control systems are also disclosed. Methods of controlling torque and battery management are also disclosed.
