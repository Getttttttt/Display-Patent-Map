abstract
    A first, and second twin AC inverters for a hybrid vehicle, whereby, the first and second inverters having a first, and second twin AC hard wire terminal blocks, a cool-down C-D process, and a conventional Engine Control Unit computerized remote-control drive system, whereby, being capable of activating the twin AC terminal blocks for Freeway speed, hills, faster acceleration, and a hybrid vehicle momentum regenerative braking kinetic energy process for: charging a battery-pack, and multiple batteries. The computer being capable of activating the first terminal block, when the cool-down process is to end, and deactivating the second terminal block, when the cool-down process is to began. The Computer is capable of activating the first, or second terminal blocks, whereby, for operating in conjunction with one another for the Freeway speed for charging the battery-pack, including multiple batteries with respect to the above modification.
