abstract
    A driving force control system for a hybrid vehicle is provided to reduce a shock resulting from switching a travelling direction between the forward direction and the backward direction. The control system is applied to a hybrid vehicle in which an operating mode can be selected at least from a series mode and a series parallel mode. A travelling direction of the vehicle is switched by a shifting device between forward direction and backward direction. A controller is configured to maintain the previous operating mode after switching the travelling direction of the vehicle by the shifting device.
