abstract
    The present disclosure relates to systems and methods useful for power production utilizing direct combustion of a solid fuel, such as coal, biomass, or the like. The systems and methods can combine a first power producing cycle that is an open loop or semi-closed loop cycle with a second power producing cycle that is a closed loop cycle utilizing a recycled working fluid, preferably CO2. At least one stream from the open loop or semi-closed loop cycle can be used in a heating member to provide heat to the working fluid in the closed loop cycle. The solid fuel can be combusted at conditions facilitating easier removal of solids before a gaseous stream is treated and, optionally, at least partially recycled to the combustor as a recycle stream, preferably include CO2.
