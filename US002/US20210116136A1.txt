abstract
    A heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system includes a refrigerant circuit configured to circulate a refrigerant to condition an air flow within an air flow conduit and a reheat system fluidly separate from the refrigerant circuit, wherein the reheat system is configured to utilize a waste fluid from a waste heat source to reheat the air flow conditioned by the refrigerant circuit.
