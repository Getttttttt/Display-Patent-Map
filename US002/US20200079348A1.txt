abstract
    A method for controlling deceleration of a vehicle using front driving environment information includes: receiving, by a controller, the driving environment information in front of the vehicle; determining, by the controller, deceleration target speed of the vehicle based on the driving environment information; determining, by the controller, predicted deceleration energy based on the deceleration target speed; determining, by the controller, predicted charging energy that is charged by a driving motor of the vehicle to a battery supplying electric power to the driving motor based on the deceleration target speed; determining, by the controller, whether predicted hydraulic braking energy of the vehicle is generated based on the predicted deceleration energy and the predicted charging energy; and when the predicted deceleration energy is determined to exceed the predicted charging energy, controlling, by the controller, the driving motor to perform regenerative braking based on the predicted charging energy.
