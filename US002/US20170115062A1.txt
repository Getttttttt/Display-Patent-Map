abstract
    An apparatus for producing cement clinker, comprising a kiln for calcining raw materials to form cement clinker, comprising a preheating stage for preheating the raw materials in a counter-flow to kiln off-gases, comprising a clinker cooler for cooling the cement clinker, comprising a denoxing stage for denoxing kiln off-gases, comprising a heat exchanger for heating the kiln off-gases upstream of the denoxing stage by heat exchange with a heat exchange medium, comprising at least one further heat exchanger for heating the heat exchange medium by heat exchange with kiln off-gases or exhaust air of the clinker cooler, wherein the heat exchanger is connected to the further heat exchanger via a line for the heat exchange medium, wherein a hot gas filter is arranged in the flow direction upstream of the further heat exchanger.
