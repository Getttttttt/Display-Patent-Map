abstract
    The description relates to reducing hydrochloric acid in cement kilns. In one aspect, an aqueous copper-based chloride remediator is introduced into contact with combustion gases from a cement kiln. Injection is made into a defined introduction zone under conditions effective for HCl emissions control wherein the temperature is within the range of from 300° F. to 800° F., preferably from 550° F. to 750° F. The resulting d gases are discharged from the defined zone following sufficient reaction time to reduce the HCl concentration in the gases.
