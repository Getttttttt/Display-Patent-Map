abstract
    A desiccant cooling system includes a desiccant module mounted in a division plate to be rotatable and having a side mounted in a desiccant cooling path through which indoor air moves and another side mounted in a regeneration path through which outdoor air moves, a preliminary cooler mounted at an upstream of the desiccant module in the desiccant cooling path and configured to cool the indoor air flowing into the desiccant cooling path; and a main cooler mounted at a downstream of the desiccant module in the desiccant cooling path, and configured to cool the indoor air dehumidified by passing through the desiccant module and supply the cooled indoor air to an air-conditioning space, wherein a dew-point temperature of the indoor air dehumidified by passing through the side of the desiccant module is less than a temperature of the main cooler.
