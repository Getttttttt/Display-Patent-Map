abstract
    An internal combustion engine system and method comprises an internal combustion engine adapted to be fueled by a diesel fuel and hydrogen gas, and to emit an exhaust of hot water and hot exhaust gas; a boiler for converting the exhausts from the internal combustion engine to steam; a steam engine adapted to receive the steam from the boiler; an electric generator powered by the steam engine and adapted to generate electric energy; a hydrogen generator powered by the electric generator and adapted to produce hydrogen gas; and conduit means for carrying the hydrogen gas to the internal combustion engine to fuel the engine for further operation; and means for reducing flow of diesel fuel to the internal combustion engine by about 30%, such that the engine runs on the hydrogen gas and the reduced diesel fuel, and the hot water and hot gas produced thereby flow to the boiler for continued operation of a cycle.
