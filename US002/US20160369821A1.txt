abstract
    Disclosed is a method and system that compresses ionized gas is stored in at least one containment cell. The compressed ionized gas is transferred from the at least on containment cell to an expansion chamber in which a piston is situated; The piston moves based in part on a reaction between ionized gas in the expansion chamber and an electrical charge of a surface of a head of the piston. The movement of the piston drives a drive shaft. Movement of the drive shaft is converted to electrical energy.
