abstract
    A waste heat recovery boiler in producing glass beads includes an equipment base arranged at the lower part of the waste heat recovery boiler. The upper part of the equipment base is connected with a cylindrical combustion production chamber, the lower part of the combustion production chamber is provided with a raw material inlet with single-layer or staggered layers. A finished product outlet is arranged at the lower end inside the combustion diffusion chamber, a membrane wall is arranged outside the combustion diffusion chamber, a steam-water lead-out straight tube system is symmetrically arranged at the upper end of the combustion diffusion chamber, a top annular water collecting tank is connected between the steam-water lead-out straight tube system and a steam-water lead-out tube system, and the steam-water lead-out tube system is connected with an upper drum.
