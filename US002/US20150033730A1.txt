abstract
    A component of an air cycle machine includes a fan housing portion, a compressor housing portion, a main bore housing radius, a static seal radius, a shroud pilot housing radius, and an insulator seal plate housing radius. The fan housing portion includes a shroud for a fan section. The compressor housing portion includes a shroud for a compressor air inlet, a shroud portion for a compressor blade section, and a shroud portion for a compressor air outlet. The main bore housing radius is arranged about a central axis and is configured to circumscribe a shaft arranged along the central axis, the main bore housing radius being between 1.9400 and 1.9440 inches. The static seal portion is arranged about the central axis and positioned longitudinally adjacent to the main bore housing portion. The static seal portion is configured to circumscribe a static seal defined by the shaft, and has a radius between 2.0420 and 2.0440 inches. The shroud pilot housing radius is arranged about the central axis. The shroud pilot housing radius is between 5.9440 and 5.9470 inches. The insulator seal plate housing radius is arranged about the central axis and is configured to mate with an adjacent turbine section component. The insulator seal plate housing radius is between 8.6380 and 8.6420 inches.
