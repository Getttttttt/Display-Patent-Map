abstract
    A composite ion exchange membrane is made by combining ionomer with porous polyolefin, such as polyethylene or polypropylene. The composite ion exchange membrane may be used in the core of an energy recovery ventilator. The core of the energy recovery ventilator may comprise corrugated or pleated supports for supporting the composite ion exchange membrane. The air flow into the energy recovery ventilator may be modified to actively create non-laminar flow.
