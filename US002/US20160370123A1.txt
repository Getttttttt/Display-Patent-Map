abstract
    The present invention provides an energy storage system (10) for a use with a boiler (20). The energy storage system (10) comprises a plurality of thermal energy storage banks (101, 102, 103, 104). Each thermal energy storage bank (101, 102, 103, 104) comprises phase changeable material having a predetermined phase transformation temperature. The energy storage system (10) also includes an extraction device (105; 115) configured to recover waste energy from the boiler (20). The extraction device (105, 115) is operable to extract waste energy from the boiler (20) and feed that energy to at least one (101) of the thermal energy storage banks (101, 102, 103, 104). A controller (106) is arranged, in use, to activate the extraction device (105, 115) in response to operation of the boiler (20).
