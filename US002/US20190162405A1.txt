abstract
    The invention relates to a staggered firing for combustion of wet charge materials, consisting of the following steps: pre-combustion designed as a fluidized bed firing, heat transition in a heat exchanger, dust precipitation, and post-combustion. The staggered firing is characterized in that during the heat transition in the heat exchanger, exhaust gases from the pre-combustion are cooled and combustion air for pre-combustion is heated and then supplied to the pre-combustion.
