abstract
    An evacuation system for an electric arc furnace that includes a combustion chamber downstream of the electric arc furnace, for receiving exhaust comprising gas and particulate from the electric arc furnace. The evacuation system also includes a dropout section downstream of the combustion chamber, for receiving the exhaust from the combustion chamber, for collecting the particulate, and for allowing the gas to pass through the dropout section to an exhaust duct.
