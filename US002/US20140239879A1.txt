abstract
    A charging system for a traction battery is disclosed. The charging system includes a power grid, a stationary battery, a first controlled power supply, a second controlled power supply, and a switching unit. The first controlled power supply is configured to provide electrical power from the power grid to the stationary battery, at a first controlled rate. The second controlled power supply is configured to provide electrical power from the stationary battery to a traction battery, at a second controlled rate, higher than the first controlled rate.
