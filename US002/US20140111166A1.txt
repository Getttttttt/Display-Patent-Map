abstract
    A circuit may comprise a direct current (DC)/DC boost converter connected to a battery that includes a plurality of cells; a DC link connected between the DC/DC boost converter and an inverter; and/or a charging circuit connected between the battery and the DC link. The charging circuit may be connected to the DC/DC boost converter in parallel. A method of charging a battery using a regenerative energy of a motor may include storing the regenerative energy of the motor by using a converter with a multi-winding transformer, selecting a cell to be charged from among a plurality of cells included in the battery, and transferring the stored regenerative energy to the selected cell by using the converter.
