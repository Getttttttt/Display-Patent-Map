abstract
    A drive system for a rail vehicle includes a plurality of drive motors. The drive motors include at least one permanent magnet motor and at least one asynchronous motor and/or at least one reluctance motor. A rail vehicle having wheelsets, each of which includes two oppositely disposed wheels and which are driven at least partially by the drive system, is also provided.
