abstract
    A control system for a vehicle comprises a controller (114), with the controller (114) further including a processor and a memory. The memory stores instructions executable by the processor such that the controller is programmed to detect a temperature difference (ΔTEvap), select a flow ratio, and select a valve opening setting (242, 244, 250, 252, 258, 260). The difference in temperature (ΔTEvap) is between a working fluid (15) downstream of a first evaporator (16) and a working fluid (15) downstream of a second evaporator (20). The flow ratio is a desired flow ratio based on the difference in temperature (ΔTEvap). The valve opening setting (242, 244, 250, 252, 258, 260) for each of a first valve (84) regulating flow of the working fluid into the first evaporator (16) and a second valve (86) regulating flow of the working fluid into the second evaporator (20) based on the flow ratio.
