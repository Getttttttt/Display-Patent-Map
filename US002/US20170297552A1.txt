abstract
    An electric motorcycle includes a driving command detecting device, a state value detecting device, an electric motor driving a drive wheel, a control unit for executing a non-normal mode causing output of the electric motor in a non-normal mode to differ from the output of the electric motor in a normal mode, the control unit configured to shift the electric motorcycle from one of the normal or non-normal modes to the other normal or non-normal mode, when the state value satisfies a predetermined shift condition, in one of the normal and non-normal modes, and a cornering determiner unit for determining cornering status, wherein the control unit causes a change in the output of the electric motor to be less, when the electric motorcycle is cornering and the shift condition is satisfied than when the cornering determiner unit determines the electric motorcycle is not cornering and the shift condition is satisfied.
