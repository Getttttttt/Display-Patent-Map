abstract
    An apparatus for heating water comprises a tank formed by a tank wall and having a water inlet and a water outlet and a water collection pan in a bottom portion thereof and a burner located through a wall of the tank so as to position a flame originating therefrom above a surface of water located in the collection pan. The apparatus further includes an exhaust pipe extending from the tank, at least one water distribution manifold sized to be located in the exhaust pipe of the water heater in fluidic communication with a water supply and having a plurality of ports therein to distributed water therethrough and at least one permeable layer supported below the at least one water distribution manifold.
