abstract
    An electric motor control system includes an inverter, an element temperature observation data acquiring device, a rotational speed upper limit setting device, and a rotational speed limiter. The inverter includes switching elements. The element temperature observation data acquiring device is configured to acquire element temperature observation data indicating an observation value of a temperature of the switching elements of the inverter. The rotational speed upper limit setting device is configured to set a rotational speed upper limit of an electric motor in accordance with the observation value of the temperature of the switching elements so as to satisfy a first condition that a voltage applicable to the switching elements in a case where the electric motor is operated at the rotational speed upper limit is lower than or equal to a withstand voltage of the switching elements.
