abstract
    A separation valve mechanism includes a housing, and a stepped piston fitted into the housing in a liquid-tight and slidable manner and serving as a separation piston. A large diameter chamber is provided on a large diameter side of the stepped piston, and a small diameter chamber is provided on a small diameter side thereof. A first seal member is provided on the small diameter side of the stepped piston so as to secure liquid tightness of the small diameter chamber and partition the small diameter chamber. A second seal member is provided on the large diameter side of the stepped piston so as to secure liquid tightness of the large diameter chamber and partition the large diameter chamber. A reservoir chamber is formed, which is adjacent to the small diameter chamber and the large diameter chamber, and is partitioned by the first seal member and the second seal member. A master cylinder pressure is not input to the reservoir chamber.
