abstract
    A power system for a vehicle or a facility utilizing an electric traction motor which is operated by a bank of batteries. The batteries are charged by a fuel operated electrical generator which is cooled by a radiator. A solar cell provides additional electrical output to the bank of batteries, while a ram air turbine may be employed for added electrical power or for regenerative braking. The traction motor operates a drive shaft through a differential gear mechanism to operate the wheels of the vehicle.
