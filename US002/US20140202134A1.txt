abstract
    A method for controlling a heat recovery device in an internal combustion engine, in particular, for a motor vehicle. The heat recovery device is provided with a circuit for a working medium having an evaporator of an expansion machine that is arranged in an exhaust gas flow path of the internal combustion engine, a condensor, an expansion tank, and a feed pump. The working temperature of the working medium is controlled by varying the mass flow of the working fluid as a function of at least one operating parameter. A setpoint value of the working medium mass flow of an exhaust gas flow path of an exhaust gas tract and/or an exhaust gas recirculation line is calculated on the basis of a base setpoint value for the working medium mass flow. The base setpoint value for the working medium mass flow is at least a function of the exhaust gas temperature, preferably upstream of the evaporator, and of the exhaust gas mass flow in the exhaust gas flow path.
