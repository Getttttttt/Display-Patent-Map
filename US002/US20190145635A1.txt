abstract
    An air handling system configured to channel an airflow includes a blower assembly including a blower inlet and a blower outlet and a primary heat exchanger positioned downstream of the blower outlet. The air handling system also includes a secondary heat exchanger positioned upstream of the blower inlet such that the airflow is channeled sequentially through the secondary heat exchanger, the blower assembly, and the primary heat exchanger.
