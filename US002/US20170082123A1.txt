abstract
    Systems store energy mechanically at a first time and extract the energy at a later time. When excess electricity from renewable sources or during off-peak periods is available, a pump directs a working liquid (L) to pressurize a gas (G) that is confined within a pressure vessel. When electricity from renewable sources is not available or during periods of peak demand or pricing, the pressurized gas (G) directs the working liquid (L) through a hydropower turbine. The turbine drives a generator through a mechanical coupling to provide electricity for powering a load. In addition, the system can leverage (take) any waste heat as the input to boost the efficiency of the system. The described systems function at ground level and are modular and scalable in capacity.
