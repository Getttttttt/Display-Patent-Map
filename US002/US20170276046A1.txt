abstract
    A method of designing a gas turbine engine includes configuring a speed reduction device for driving a fan and configuring a lubrication system for lubricating components across a rotation gap. The lubrication system includes a lubricant input. A stationary first bearing receives lubricant from the lubricant input and has a first race in which lubricant flows. A second bearing for rotation is within the first bearing. The second bearing has a first opening in registration with the first race such that lubricant may flow from the first race through the first opening into a first conduit. The first bearing is configured to also include a second race into which lubricant flows. The second bearing has a second opening in registration with the second race such that lubricant may flow from the second race through the second opening into a second conduit. The first and second conduits deliver lubricant to distinct locations.
