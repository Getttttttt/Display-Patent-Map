abstract
    A plant complex for pig iron production may include a furnace and a furnace gas conduit system for a furnace gas quantity stream that comprises nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The plant complex may also include a hydrogen source, an H2 gas conduit system for a hydrogen-containing gas quantity stream emitted from the hydrogen source, a mixing apparatus for establishing a mixed gas formed from the furnace gas stream and the hydrogen-containing gas quantity stream. The mixing apparatus may be connected to the furnace gas conduit system and to the H2 gas conduit system. The mixed gas established may have a stoichiometric mixing quotient formed from a dividend with a difference value between molar amounts of hydrogen as minuend and carbon dioxide as subtrahend and of a divisor with a sum value of molar amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The plant complex may also include a mixed gas conduit system and a chemical plant connected to the mixed gas conduit system.
