abstract
    A method and system for integrating a power plant and a post combustion capture plant for producing carbon dioxide. The power plant can provide electricity to the post combustion capture plant created by passing steam from a boiler through turbines and feeding the flue gas created by heating the boiler as a feed gas stream to the post combustion capture plant. A back pressure turbine is utilized to provide a significant amount of electrical power while extracted steam is being expanded before being introduced into the reboiler present in the post combustion capture plant
