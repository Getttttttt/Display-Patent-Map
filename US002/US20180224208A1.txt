abstract
    A continuous aluminum melting furnace with a porous spray pipe heat exchanger, comprising a furnace body, combustion nozzles, a smoke pipeline and a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger comprises a smoke channel and heat exchange cylinders, wherein each of the heat exchange cylinders comprises a head end, a tail end, and a porous spray pipe in at least one of the cylinders. The porous spray pipe comprises a closed end and a pipe body, with several air spray holes provided on a peripheral wall of the pipe body so that cold air entering the at least one heat exchange cylinder is sprayed to an inner wall of the cylinder so as to exchange heat with high-temperature smoke which flows through an outer wall of the cylinder, thus keeping the temperature of the cylinder lower than the rated tolerant temperature of the material from which the cylinder is made.
