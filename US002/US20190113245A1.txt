abstract
    An air conditioning system including a condenser system and a closed-loop air-to-water system. The condenser system includes a compressor which pressurizes refrigerant and distributes the pressurized refrigerant to at least one condenser coil, which climatizes water; and a fan which exhausts heat from the pressurized refrigerant. The closed-loop air-to-water system includes a climatized liquid tank, which receives climatized water from the at least one condenser coil; and an air handler disposed within a building, the air handler having a climatized liquid coil. The air handler is disposed to receive air from inside the building; transfer thermal energy from the climatized liquid coil to ambient air, creating climatized air; and distribute the climatized air to at least a portion of the building. The climatized water may be distributed to a recycled liquid tank, which may redistribute the climatized water to the climatized liquid tank, forming a closed-loop air-to-water system.
