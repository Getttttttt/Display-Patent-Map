abstract
    A vehicle with electric drive can employ a pulse width modulation technique to govern the amount of drive power provided to the vehicles wheels while also governing the charging power supplied to the storage device. For example, an electric motor, generator, and a drive shaft can all be linked such that when one spins, they all spin. The disclosed technique provides for rapidly switching from powering a wheel to charging the battery. In fact, the switching can be done rapidly enough that the battery can be charged between every pulse provided to the motor. This rapid switching provides for advanced capabilities in energy harvesting and vehicle weight distribution.
