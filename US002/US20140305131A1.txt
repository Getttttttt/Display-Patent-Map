abstract
    A method for feeding back exhaust gas from a gas turbine with a downstream waste heat boiler, wherein this exhaust gas is metered into the air inflow stream of a gas turbine, with the result that the temperature and the composition of the exhaust gas can be controlled, and in this way highly concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) is obtained which can be injected into a storage facility, so that the balance of the carbon dioxide for the entire process can be kept low or is negligible. The temperature in the gas turbine can be lowered and the proportion of carbon dioxide in the exhaust gas can be considerably increased. After combustion has taken place and heat has been exchanged, gas washing is possible, carbon dioxide can be recovered and, the proportion of free oxygen in the exhaust gas can be lowered.
