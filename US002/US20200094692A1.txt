abstract
    A vehicle control apparatus includes an inverter controller. The inverter controller holds a plurality of control maps for an inverter. The inverter supplies electric power to a drive motor. The drive motor drives a drive wheel of the vehicle. The inverter controller selects any one of the plurality of control maps on a basis of a notification instruction that instructs to notify a driver of information. The inverter controller controls an operation of the inverter on a basis of the control map selected.
