abstract
    A power system for a locomotive. The power system includes an alternator, a first inverter system, a traction motor, a second inverter system and an auxiliary power unit. The first inverter system is coupled to the alternator and receives high voltage power from the alternator. The traction motor is coupled to the first inverter system receives high voltage power from the first inverter system. The second inverter system is also coupled to the alternator. The second inverter system steps down the high voltage power from the alternator. The auxiliary power unit is coupled to the second inverter system and receives the stepped down voltage power from the second inverter system.
