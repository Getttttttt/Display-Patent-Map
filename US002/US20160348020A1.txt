abstract
    The invention relates to a lignite fired steam power plant comprising a water/steam power cycle and a lignite dryer system having a heat pump circuit configured and arranged to provide heat energy to a lignite dryer of the dryer system. The heat pump includes a dryer heat exchanger, an expansion device and an evaporator heat exchanger connected to the first outlet line so as to enable heat energy transfer from the vapour of the first outlet line to the first working fluid. A compressor is also included in the heat pump circuit. In addition the heat pump circuit is connected to the water/steam power cycle by a steam makeup line from the pressure series of steam turbines and a condensate return line.
