abstract
    A method for manually and individually configuring a recuperation behavior of an electrically driven vehicle includes the manual setting of the recuperation behavior. The manual setting of the recuperation behavior includes both setting a recuperation intensity and setting a recuperation delay. Accordingly, it is possible to manually meter the braking torque such that both a pleasant driving sensation as well as a situation-specific energy recovery is achieved.
