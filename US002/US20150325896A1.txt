abstract
    If a required voltage which corresponds to a required power has reached a boundary voltage, which is an oxidation-reduction potential of platinum, which constitutes a catalyst of a fuel cell, the fuel cell system performs crossover-avoidance control that holds an FC instruction voltage for the fuel cell at the boundary voltage, and absorbs the gap between the required voltage and the FC instruction voltage by using a secondary battery.
