abstract
    A gas recycling system for a controlled atmosphere furnace includes a controlled atmosphere furnace having a product entry, a product exit, a process gas inlet adjacent said product exit, and a spent gas outlet adjacent said product entry. A spent gas recycler is operationally connected to the spent gas outlet. The recycler produces a recycled process gas stream and a waste gas stream. The recycled process gas stream is returned to the controlled atmosphere furnace. The waste gas stream is returned to the controlled atmosphere furnace at a point downstream from the spent gas outlet.
