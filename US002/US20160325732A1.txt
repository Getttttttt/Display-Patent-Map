abstract
    The present disclosure discloses a vehicle and a braking feedback control method for the same. The braking feedback control method includes the following steps: detecting a current speed of a vehicle and a depth of a braking pedal of the vehicle; when the current speed of the vehicle is greater than a preset speed, the depth of the braking pedal is greater than 0, and an anti-lock braking system of the vehicle is in a non-working state, controlling the vehicle to enter a braking feedback control mode, where when the vehicle is in the braking feedback control mode, a required braking torque corresponding to the vehicle is obtained according to the depth of the braking pedal, and a braking torque of a first motor generator, a braking torque of a second motor generator, and a braking torque of basic braking performed on the vehicle are distributed according to the required braking torque.
