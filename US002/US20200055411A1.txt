abstract
    A motor vehicle on-board power system with a power converter, windings, an electric machine and a delta switch group is described. The electric machine is connected to the power converter, wherein a DC external connection is provided. The delta switch group connects the windings in a delta configuration. At least one switch of the delta switch group also connects at least one alternating current connection of the power converter to the DC external connection. A configuration controller actuates the delta switch group and has, on the one hand, the function of actuating the delta switch group in the closed state or open state within a driving state, according to a configuration specification. When energy is transmitted via the DC external connection, at least one switch of the delta switch group is actuated by the configuration controller according to a closed switching state. In addition, an associated method is described.
