abstract
    A vehicle including a powertrain having an electric machine, an engine, a traction battery, and a controller are provided. The controller may be programmed to, in response to a state of charge of the traction battery being less than a threshold while the traction battery is powering a device external to the vehicle, operate the powertrain to charge the traction battery at a rate based on an ambient temperature irrespective of an electric load requested by the device.
