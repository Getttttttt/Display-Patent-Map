abstract
    A recuperated gas turbine engine includes an engine core that has a compressor section, a combustor section, and a turbine section. An exhaust duct is located downstream of the turbine section for receiving a hot turbine exhaust stream from the turbine section. The exhaust duct includes a heat exchanger and a temperature-control module upstream of the heat exchanger. A first compressor bleed line portion leads into the heat exchanger, and a second compressor bleed lie portion leads into the exhaust duct upstream of the heat exchanger. A compressor return line leads from the heat exchanger into the engine core upstream of the combustor section. The compressor bleed line is operable to selectively feed compressed air to the heat exchanger, and the temperature-control module is operable to selectively modulate at least one of temperature and flow of the hot turbine exhaust stream with respect to the heat exchanger.
