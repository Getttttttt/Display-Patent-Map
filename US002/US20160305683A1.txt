abstract
    A regenerative heat exchanger includes an inlet and an outlet in communication with the inlet. The heat exchanger is configured to operate in two modes. A first mode uses only an ambient flow to cool a hot flow and a second mode uses both the ambient flow and a regenerative flow to cool the hot flow.
