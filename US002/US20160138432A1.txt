abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery system includes an exhaust pipe through which exhaust gas exhausted from an engine moves, a heat exchanger mounted in the exhaust pipe and inducing heat exchange between the exhaust gas and a working fluid flowing therein, a plurality of reservoirs supplying working fluids to the heat exchanger, and channel adjusting valves allowing any one of the plurality of reservoirs to be in communication with the heat exchanger.
