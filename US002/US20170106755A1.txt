abstract
    A vehicle control apparatus includes a controller configured to change a ratio between a regenerative braking force and a frictional braking force, in a specific wheel among wheels, such that the ratio in the specific wheel differs from the ratio between the regenerative braking force and the frictional braking force in each of the other wheels, when a command to generate the require braking force is issued and a vehicle motion control is executed.
