abstract
    A number of variations include a product including system including a fluid circuit comprising a fluid, a pump, an expander, a power generation component, at least one heat exchanger, and a condenser, wherein the condenser is constructed and arranged to be mounted in the path of ram air on a vehicle; and an attachment for attaching at least the condenser to the vehicle in the path of ram air. In a number of variations, the system may include an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system in a vehicle to convert waste heat energy to usable power where the condenser of the ORC system is housed within the fairing on the vehicle cabin roof to ensure placement within the path of ram air on the vehicle.
