abstract
    A heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system includes a heat pump having a housing. The HVAC system also includes an energy recovery ventilator (ERV) or heat recover ventilator (HRV) integrated with the heat pump such that an access panel to the ERV or HRV faces outwardly from the housing of the heat pump, and such that the access panel is accessible at an outer boundary of the housing.
