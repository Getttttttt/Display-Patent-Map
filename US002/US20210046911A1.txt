abstract
    A system for multiple brakes intelligently controlled by a single brake input on a personal mobility vehicle. By determining a front and rear brake differential based on the position and weight of the rider as well as the environmental and vehicle conditions, the system may reduce the risk of the vehicle skidding or tipping due to over-braking. In some embodiments, a rider may use a single brake lever to indicate a desire to brake and the system may make determinations about how to apply a combination of mechanical and electrical brakes to front and back wheels. By applying different braking systems based on a combination of controls and sensors, the system may improve user experience and user safety, especially for inexperienced riders.
