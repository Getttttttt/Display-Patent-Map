abstract
    Power systems and methods described herein can provide power system management and power delivery, among other functionality. The power systems and methods for a vehicle can employ a fuel cell, such as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), as a power source in conjunction with another power sources, such as one or more vehicle batteries, capacitors, etc. The fuel cell can be conditionally used to provide power to the electrical system, thereby reducing the load on the vehicle batteries.
