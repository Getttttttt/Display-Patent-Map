abstract
    A solar water source heat pump air conditioning system includes an air-water heat exchange system, an aqueous solution heat exchange system, a heat pump main engine, a concentration system, an energy recovery system and a condensate water recovery system. According to the present invention, solar energy in air is absorbed by utilizing the air-water heat exchange system and is provided for a heat pump. Cold-heat transfer is performed between the air-water heat exchange system and the heat pump main engine by adopting the aqueous solution heat exchange system, thereby avoiding frosting and pipeline pollution. Cold energy of air-conditioning condensate water is collected by utilizing the condensate water recovery system and then is used, thereby increasing efficiency of the heat pump main engine. Air flowing through the air-water heat exchange system is purified by adopting a haze purification system, thereby improving air quality.
