abstract
    A papermaking process including the steps of forming a wet paper web on a papermaking machine, pulling vacuum through the web to remove water from the web and thereby generate discharge air, and diverting at least a portion of the discharge air through a control loop to a hot air drying system within the papermaking process to aid in drying the web, wherein the vacuum is generated by centrifugal blowers.
