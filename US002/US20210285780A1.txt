abstract
    Methods and systems for operating a transport climate control system of a vehicle are provided. The method includes obtaining a state of charge of an energy storage device capable of providing power to the transport climate control system; determining an energy level including the state of charge, receiving a planned route for the vehicle, and receiving route status data associated with the planned route for the vehicle. The route status data includes traffic data, weather data, and/or geographic data identifying areas where the transport climate control system is to be solely powered by the energy storage device. The method further includes determining whether the energy level is sufficient to complete the planned route for the vehicle based on the planned route and the route data, and when the energy level is not sufficient to complete the planned route for the vehicle, providing a notification to a user via a display.
