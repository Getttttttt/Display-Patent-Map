abstract
    A vehicle system, comprising an internal combustion engine, a transmission enclosed within a transmission case coupled to a gaseous fuel source, the transmission case having an amount of gaseous fuel located therein. Housing the transmission in a case containing low density gaseous fuel reduces the power losses from air resistance and increases fuel efficiency.
