abstract
    A controller for a motor vehicle powertrain, the controller being configured to control the amount of torque generated by each of a plurality of drive torque sources in order to generate a net torque corresponding to a predetermined torque demand value, the predetermined torque demand value being determined at least in part by reference to a torque demand signal received by the controller, each drive torque source being coupled via a respective torque transfer arrangement to a respective group of one or more wheels, the controller being configured to cause at least one drive torque source to generate positive or negative torque in dependence on the predetermined torque demand value and to cause the drive torque source to undergo a torque reversal operation in which the direction of torque generated by the at least one drive torque sources changes from one direction to the other, the controller being configured wherein, during a torque reversal operation, the controller limits the rate of change of torque generated by the at least one of the plurality of drive torque sources as the amount of torque generated passes through zero and attempts to compensate for the reduction in rate of change of torque by a corresponding change in the amount of torque generated by one or more other of the plurality of drive torque sources.
