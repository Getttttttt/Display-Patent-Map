abstract
    An internal combustion engine includes an intake conduit fluidically coupled to ambient fluid and having an internal cross-sectional area and an engine cylinder fluidically coupled to the intake conduit. A fluidic amplifier is disposed within the intake conduit and is fluidically coupled to the ambient fluid and engine cylinder. The amplifier is further fluidically coupled to a source of primary fluid and is configured to introduce the primary fluid and at least a portion of the ambient fluid to the engine cylinder.
