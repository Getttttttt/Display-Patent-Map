abstract
    An example oven for heating fibers includes a chamber having upper and lower portions and a supply structure between first and second ends of the chamber, wherein the supply structure is in communication with a first heating system and is configured to direct first heated gas from the first heating system into the upper portion of the chamber to heat fibers in the upper portion at a first temperature, and wherein the supply structure is in communication with a second heating system and is configured to direct second heated gas from the second heating system into the lower portion of the chamber to heat fibers in the lower portion at a second temperature different than the first temperature such that the upper and lower portions of the chamber maintain the different temperatures without a physical barrier between the upper and lower portion.
