abstract
    An electricity production system configured to operate in accordance with a method of operating an electricity production system that at least includes the steps of: determining an oxygen distribution between oxygen gas to be separated by an air separation unit (“ASU”) and oxygen gas stored in a storage tank of the ASU to be fed to the boiler unit, determining a carbon capture value for a gas processing unit, determining a power consumption value for the gas processing unit and the ASU, determining a total power demand value based on the power consumption value of the gas processing unit and the ASU, and on a determined electricity demand, and controlling the boiler unit, the turbine, the ASU, and the gas processing unit based on the determined total power demand along with correcting signals generated from a coordinated Model Predictive Control.
