abstract
    A brake control device for a vehicle, includes: a master cylinder outputting a brake fluid of a master pressure; a master pressure changing device for changing the master pressure; a brake actuator for controlling a brake pressure of the brake fluid supplied from the master cylinder to a wheel cylinder; and a control device performing an automatic brake control including first and second modes. In the first mode, the control device operates the brake actuator to make a target value of the brake pressure. In the second mode, the control device operates the master pressure changing device such that the master pressure becomes the target value of the brake pressure to change the brake pressure of the target wheel in conjunction with the master pressure. The control device selects one of the first and second modes depending on a type of the automatic brake control.
