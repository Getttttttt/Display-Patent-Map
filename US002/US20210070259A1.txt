abstract
    A regenerative braking apparatus for a motor vehicle (and concomitant method and retrofit kit) comprising a two-piece rim, a power spring inside the rim, a winding apparatus transferring energy into the power spring, a speed reducer that allows for smooth accumulation of tension in the power spring, and a controlled holding brake system that allows for bypassed, autonomous, or on-demand application of the regenerative braking apparatus.
