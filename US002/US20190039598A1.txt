abstract
    A control device is provided for a vehicle which includes an electric motor that executes regeneration during deceleration of the vehicle and which performs manned running with at least one occupant in the vehicle and also unmanned running without any occupant in the vehicle. The control device is configured to cause the electric motor to execute the regeneration within a regeneration allowable range, such that the regeneration allowable range for the unmanned running of the vehicle is larger than the regeneration allowable range for the manned running of the vehicle. The regeneration allowable range is defined by, for example, an allowable maximum regenerative torque that is variable depending on a running speed of the vehicle upon the regeneration by the electric motor.
