abstract
    A regenerative braking control method of a vehicle, may include a first operation of determining a driving risk of a road surface on the basis of a status of the road surface while driving; a second operation of determining whether an accelerator pedal is released while driving; a third operation of determining whether a brake pedal is operated while driving; and a fourth operation of performing no regenerative braking when the accelerator pedal is determined as being released, the driving risk of the road surface is determined as being high, and when the brake pedal is determined as not being operated.
