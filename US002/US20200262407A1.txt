abstract
    A braking control device includes a first adjustment unit, a master unit, a regenerative coordination unit, a first opening/closing valve, a second opening/closing valve, a reaction force hydraulic pressure sensor, an input hydraulic pressure sensor, a controller. The master unit includes a master cylinder and a master piston, a master chamber, a servo chamber, and a reaction force chamber. The regenerative coordination unit includes an input piston. The first opening/closing valve provided in a first fluid passage. The second opening/closing valve provided in a second fluid passage. The reaction force hydraulic pressure sensor detects a pressure in the reaction force chamber. The input hydraulic pressure sensor detects a pressure in the input cylinder. The controller determines, based on the reaction force hydraulic pressure and the input hydraulic pressure, suitability of at least one of the master unit, the regenerative coordination unit, the first opening/closing valve, and the second opening/closing valve.
