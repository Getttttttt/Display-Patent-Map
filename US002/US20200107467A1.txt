abstract
    An electronic equipment enclosure which regulates incoming outside air to within the operational limits of the electronic equipment within is described. The enclosure recirculates the wasted heat from the equipment to regulate both the temperature and humidity within the enclosure to acceptable levels without relying on any heating or air conditioning component. Thus, the enclosure assembly relies entirely on air flow for regulating the temperature inside the enclosure. Additionally, the recirculation feature of the enclosure allows the electronic equipment to operate at outside temperatures much lower than the stated operational range by modifying the temperature of the intake air of the equipment. A method of controlling the temperature inside an enclosure is also described.
