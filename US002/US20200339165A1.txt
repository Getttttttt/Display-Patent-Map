abstract
    A device for decelerating a vehicle traveling on one or more rails, the device including: energy absorbing units disposed along a direction of travel of the vehicle, the energy absorbing units each having a first surface for engagement with a second surface disposed on the vehicle such that the energy absorbing units are compressed when the second surface travels past and engages with the first surface of the energy absorbing units; wherein the absorbing units, when compressed, are configured to convert a kinetic energy of the vehicle to one or more of potential, heat and electrical energy; and the energy absorbing units are opposed to each other in a lateral direction relative to a direction of travel of the vehicle such that forces acting on the second surface from the energy absorbing units cancel in the lateral direction.
