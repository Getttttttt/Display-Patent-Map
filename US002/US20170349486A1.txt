abstract
    Disclosed is a method for producing sintered material from organic raw materials, implemented in an apparatus comprising, a cyclone preheater, a rotary furnace and a grate cooler, and in which the raw materials are preheated in the cyclone preheater, the preheated material is calcined and sintered in the rotary furnace, and the calcined materials are cooled by blowing cooling air in the grate cooler, producing hot air. The hot air is separated into three upstream-to-downstream fractions, the three hot air fractions being at decreasing temperatures. The first air fraction acts as combustion air in at least the combustion zone of the rotary furnace and/or of the potential precalciner of the apparatus. The second air fraction is greater than the combustion air needs to produce energy. The third air fraction is directed at least in part to the combustion zone of the apparatus, providing combustion air with the first air fraction.
