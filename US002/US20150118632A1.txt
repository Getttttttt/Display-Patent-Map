abstract
    A conveyor oven for heating and cooling a material at varying air temperatures is proposed. The conveyor oven houses a conveyor and a plurality of climate controlled heating and cooling zones through which the material is transported. In a preheating zone, the material is heated to a desired temperature by at least one cooling fan system that provides exhaust air to the zone. In a heating zone, the material is heated by a heating system cycle comprising an air compressor, a turbine combustor, a turbine preheater, a turbine, a generator, a turbine combustor, and a combustor. In a cooling zone, the material is cooled to a desired temperature by at least one air fan system. Material that has been heated and cooled in the conveyor oven exists via the conveyor belt where it is removed by human and/or machine means.
