abstract
    The invention relates to a turbine, in particular a combustion gas turbine, which drives a high-speed generator for generating electricity, said turbine having a high efficiency. The turbine has at least one combustion chamber (6), which is provided with a fuel injection means (7) and an ignition device (8) and which supplies the turbine with a combustion gas. An external compressor (3) is associated with the turbine. Said compressor has a separate electric drive and is not connected to the turbine by means of a drive shaft. Furthermore, at least two combustion chambers (5) are provided for discontinuous, pulsed combustion and supply of the turbine.
