abstract
    A drag chain carbonizer is provided with a system and methods for anaerobic thermal conversion processing to convert waste into various solid carbonized products and varied further co-products. The drag-chain carbonizer includes an adjustable bed depth mechanism, a heating mechanism, a pressure management mechanism, an atmospheric management mechanism, and a chain tensioning mechanism containing at least one position sensor for communication of an actuator position to at least one programmable logic controller (PLC). Carbonaceous waste is transformed into useful co-products that can be re-introduced into the stream of commerce at various economically advantageous points. Depending upon the input materials and the parameters selected to process the waste, including real time economic and other market parameters, the system adjusts co-products output to reflect changing market conditions.
