abstract
    An evaporation cycle of a natural circulation steam generator. An evaporator is in flow connection with a downcomer pipe and includes a first evaporative section and a second evaporative section connected in parallel with the first evaporative section and arranged at a higher level than the first evaporative section. The evaporator cycle is not associated with another external source of motive force than heat from the gas flow to assist the flow of the water in the evaporator, and the evaporator has a vertically extending outlet collector for collecting the steam and water from the first and second evaporative sections to the riser pipe. The outlet collector includes a lower portion and an upper portion above the lower portion. The first evaporative section is in direct flow connection with the lower portion and the second evaporative section is in direct flow connection with the upper portion.
