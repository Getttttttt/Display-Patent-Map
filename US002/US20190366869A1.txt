abstract
    An ECU performs processing including steps as follows: in a case where an actual SOC is more than or equal to an upper limit value SOC(0) and a vehicle is in a Ready-Off state, when an SMR is in a cut-off state, the ECU performs the step of discharging a battery using discharging devices, and when the SMR is not in the cut-off state, the ECU performs the step of discharging the battery using an MG.
