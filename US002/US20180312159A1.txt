abstract
    This method covers the utilization of alternators for recharging batteries and electric car mileage range improvement. It involves the usage of the rotors to charge and to extend range for an electric car, while the car is in motion. There are two methods that will be explained, these methods are called the Jent methods. The first method will be connecting the alternator to the rear axles. The second method is having an alternator rotor hybrid so that the car can still charge and have the ability to stop and apply brakes with full function.
