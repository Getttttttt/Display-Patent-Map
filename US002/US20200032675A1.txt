abstract
    A system for providing supercritical steam including a first boiler that generates steam via combusting a first fuel, and a second boiler fluidly connected to the first boiler via a conduit which heats the generated steam to supercritical steam temperatures via combusting a second fuel. A first temperature of the conduit may be below a critical corrosion temperature and a second temperature of the conduit is greater than or equal to the critical corrosion temperature. A combined carbon emission rate of the first boiler and the second boiler may be less than a combined carbon emission rate of generating and heating the steam to supercritical steam temperatures using boilers that only combust the first fuel. The first boiler may be fluidly connected to a heat exchanger that heats the generated steam to a supercritical steam temperature via a flue gas produced by a gas turbine.
