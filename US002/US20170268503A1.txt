abstract
    A gear pump (1) comprises a pump housing (2), wherein a working chamber (6) is formed in the pump housing (2). A first gearwheel (11) and a second gearwheel (12) are arranged meshing with each other in the working chamber (6). The first gearwheel (11) has a number of first teeth (13) and the second gearwheel (12) has a number of second teeth (14). A first tooth flank (13 a,  14 a) and a second tooth flank (13 b,  14 b) are formed on each of the teeth (13, 14). When the gearwheels (11, 12) mesh, the first tooth flanks (13 a) of the first teeth (13) are meshed with the first tooth flanks (14 a) of the second teeth (14). A coating (15) is arranged on each of the first tooth flanks (13 a,  14 a). The coating (15) and the first tooth flank (13 a,  14 a) are positively connected to each other.
