abstract
    The method and the device serve to treat the flue dust formed during the production of nonferrous metals. After the addition of sulfur and/or a sulfur compound, the flue dust is heated, and volatile compounds are separated in a downstream offgas treatment unit. The flue dust is heated in an inert atmosphere.
