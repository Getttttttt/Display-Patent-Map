abstract
    A method for controlling an activation state of a braking-torque assistance system for reducing intake of braking energy in a service-brake system of a vehicle includes capturing and evaluating a plurality of demand indications for a startup of the braking-torque assistance system. If the evaluation of the captured plurality of demand indications reveals a demand for the startup of the braking-torque assistance system, a plurality of operating conditions of the service-brake system are captures and evaluated over a monitoring period. If, in turn, the evaluation of the captured plurality of operating conditions reveals that an overheating of the service-brake system is imminent, the braking-torque assistance system is actuated and one or more deactivation conditions of the braking-torque assistance system are checked. If the deactivation conditions are satisfied, the braking-torque assistance system is deactivated.
