abstract
    Liquefied natural gas (LNG) boil off gas (BOG) and/or end flash gas (EFG) can be used to recondense refrigerant vent gas. For example, a method can include: passing LNG BOG through a first condensing heat exchanger and/or passing an EFG from liquefaction system through a second condensing heat exchanger; and condensing the refrigerant vent gas in the first and/or second condensing heat exchangers, wherein (when using the first condensing heat exchanger) the LNG BOG is the coolant in the first condensing heat exchanger and (when using the second condensing heat exchanger) the EFG is the coolant in the second condensing heat exchanger, and wherein (when using both condensing heat exchangers) the first and second condensing heat exchangers are in parallel and not in series.
