abstract
    A heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) includes a base and a top platform assembly disposed on the base. The top platform assembly includes a first top platform auxiliary module having a first rectangular frame in which a steam manifold is disposed, a second top platform auxiliary module having a second rectangular frame in which a high pressure (HP) drum is disposed, and a third top platform auxiliary module having a third rectangular frame in which a low pressure (LP) drum and an intermediate pressure (IP) drum are disposed. Each top platform auxiliary module may be pre-assembled on the ground prior to be raised to elevation for installed on the base.
