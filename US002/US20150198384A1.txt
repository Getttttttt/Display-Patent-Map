abstract
    A domestic boiler preheater includes a flue box having a combustion gas inlet to receive hot combustion gas from a boiler, and a combustion air inlet to receive air for combustion in a boiler. The preheater further includes a condenser having a mains cold water inlet and a mains water outlet arranged such that mains water flows through the condenser prior to being supplied to a boiler combustion chamber. The condenser further includes a central heating water return and a central heating water flow outlet arranged such that central heating water flows through the condenser prior to being supplied to the boiler combustion chamber. The condenser further includes connections that enable the condenser to be connected to preheated fluid supply pipework from a source of preheated fluid, the preheated fluid having fluid heated by heat from at least one of the combustion gas and a renewable energy source.
