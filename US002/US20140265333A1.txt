abstract
    An wood-gas power supply system include: a rectifier filter electrically coupled to a output power terminal of the wood-gas stove; a maximum power tracking circuit electrically coupled to the rectifier filter, providing a larger power; a feedback controller electrically coupled to the rectifier filter and the maximum power tracking circuit, allowing the power reach a request power value; and a DC/DC charging device receiving a current flowing the maximum power tracking circuit and converting the current to a direct current. The wood-gas power supply system applies energy storage elements and peripheral circuits to perform the closed loop control so as to adjust the output power for transmitting the steady output voltage, and to achieve the purpose of providing the steady power.
