abstract
    A heat exchanger for generating steam from water is disclosed. The exchanger comprises a first heat exchanging chamber, a second heat exchanging chamber and an array of heat pipes which are arranged to extend from within the first heat exchanging chamber to within the second heat exchanging chamber. The first heat exchanging chamber comprises a distributed inlet for passing the water into the first chamber from a distributed position around the chamber and an outlet through which the steam can exit the first chamber, the water being arranged to pass over the portion of the heat pipes which extend within the first chamber. The second heat exchanging chamber comprises an inlet for receiving a gas into the chamber and an outlet through which the gas can exit the second chamber, the gas being arranged to pass over the portion of the heat pipes which extend within the second chamber.
