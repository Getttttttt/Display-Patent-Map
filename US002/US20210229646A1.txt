abstract
    A method of controlling braking of a vehicle is provided. When a disconnector is disconnected and an auxiliary drive wheel is separated from a driving system, vehicle braking is performed with regenerative braking by a primary drive wheel motor during braking. Subsequently, the disconnector is connected based on a vehicle stability state, and then, braking is performed simultaneously on the auxiliary drive wheel and a primary drive wheel.
