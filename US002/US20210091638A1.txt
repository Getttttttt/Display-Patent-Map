abstract
    This disclosure details cooling systems for cooling electric components, such as electric machines, within electrified vehicles. Exemplary cooling systems may include a spray bar positioned relative to a rear face of a stator of the electric machine. In some embodiments, the spray bar may be positioned axially between the rear face of the stator and a torque converter housing. One or more nozzles of the spray bar are configured to direct a coolant between adjacent back irons of the stator, onto end windings of the stator, or both. Actively cooling the stator allows the electric machine to operate at higher torques and speeds, thereby increasing performance.
