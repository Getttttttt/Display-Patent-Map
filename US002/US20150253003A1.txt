abstract
    A boiler system is provided comprising: a furnace adapted to receive a fuel to be burned to generate hot working gases; a fuel supply structure associated with the furnace for supplying fuel to the furnace; a superheater section associated with the furnace and positioned to receive energy in the form of heat from the hot working gases; and a controller. The superheater section may comprise a platen including a tube structure with an end portion and a temperature sensor for measuring the temperature of the tube structure end portion and generating a signal indicative of the temperature of the tube structure end portion. The controller may be coupled to the temperature sensor for receiving and monitoring the signal from the sensor.
