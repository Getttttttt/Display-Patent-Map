abstract
    A control unit (17) includes a regenerative coordination control unit (17D) and a vehicle speed calculation unit (17E). The regenerative coordination control unit (17D) performs a regeneration cooperative control to distribute the hydraulic braking force and the regenerative braking force. The vehicle speed calculation unit (17E) calculates a vehicle speed. The control unit (17) calculates a basic target driving force based on: an amount of accelerator operation detected by an accelerator operation amount detecting unit (32), and the vehicle speed calculated by the vehicle speed calculation unit (17E), and adds a value corresponding to the regenerative braking force distributed by the regenerative coordination control unit (17D) to the basic target driving force, thus obtaining a target driving force to be generated by motors (4 and 5).
