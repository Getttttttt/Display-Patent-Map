abstract
    The invention relates to a method for recharging an electrical energy source (S) on-board an electric or hybrid vehicle, comprising at least two electric traction motors (M1,M2) respectively associated with a first and second traction converter (C1,C2) and a control electronics (E), said vehicle functioning according to a traction mode using electrical energy provided by the electrical energy source (S), according to a braking mode for recharging said electrical energy source (S) during braking or deceleration phases, and according to a shutdown recharge mode for recharging said electrical energy source (S) during the shutdown phases of the vehicle, characterized in that it consists of utilizing the control electronics (E) managing the traction converters (C1,C2) to carry out a static reconfiguration both of the two converters (C1,C2) and of the motors (M1,M2), in order to transform said converters (C1,C2) associated with the motors (M1,M2) into a charger for the on-board energy source (S).
