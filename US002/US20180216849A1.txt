abstract
    A condensate neutralizer device for treating a condensate flow, the condensate neutralizer device includes a compartment adapted to receive condensate neutralizing materials therein, the compartment having an inlet end and an outlet end, a plurality of apertures disposed only on a bottom surface of each of the inlet end and the outlet end of the compartment. The compartment is configured to receive the condensate flow traversing upwardly through the plurality of apertures at the inlet end in a direction from the inlet end to the outlet end through the condensate neutralizing materials before allowing a treated flow of the condensate flow to traverse downwardly through the plurality of apertures at the outlet end to exit the compartment as an effluent.
