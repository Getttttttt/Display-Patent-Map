abstract
    In the method according to the invention for producing cement clinker, raw cement meal is preheated in a preheater, the preheated raw cement meal is precalcined in a calciner and the precalcined raw cement meal is burnt in a kiln, fuel and combustion air having an oxygen content of at least 75 mol % being used in the calciner, and the raw cement meal being precalcined in a fluidised bed in the calciner. The exhaust gases occurring in the kiln are delivered to the preheater, bypassing the calciner, and the exhaust gases of the calciner are delivered to a CO2 preparation device.
