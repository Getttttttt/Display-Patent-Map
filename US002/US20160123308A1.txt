abstract
    A gravitational energy system for generating gravity-driven hydraulic pressure for residential and commercial energy use is provided. The gravitational energy system may be a hydraulic fluid-filled circulatory system providing a storage tank, a mass-lifting tank, a hydraulic accumulator tank and at least one hydraulic motor positioned in a descending gravitational hierarchy, respectively. The hydraulic accumulator tank may pressurize a hydraulic fluid by a predetermined mass moving from a receiving position to a pressurizing position, wherein the predetermine mass is moved to the receiving position by being operably engaged with the mass-lifting tank. The gravitational energy system may include a control circuitry configured to control the flow of the hydraulic fluid through the circulatory system by operating electronically interconnected sensors and conduit valves.
