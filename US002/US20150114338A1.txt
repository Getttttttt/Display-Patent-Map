abstract
    An internal combustion engine in which the power output is controlled by modulating at least one of the compression ratio, expansion ratio, ratio of expansion rate to compression rate, air to fuel ratio, and steam to air ratio. Continuous isobaric catalytic combustion followed by isothermal expansion and the use of separate compressor and expander devices are used. Control dynamically maximizes fuel efficiency for the given power demand conditions. Power output is controlled by modulating flame temperature and/or pressure instead of by throttling. Lean combustion, high compression ratio, exhaust heat recuperation, and high power density and fuel economy are provided. External cooling is minimized or eliminated. Insulation of the engine effectively reduces energy losses to friction. Interchangeable use of gasoline, hydrogen and ammonia at high fuel efficiency is made possible for transitional periods of fuel availabilities. An injector suitable for isothermal expansion is provided.
