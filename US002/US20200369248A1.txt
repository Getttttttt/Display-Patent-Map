abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a method for controlling a hydraulic brake system during a regenerative braking process. In the method, a displacement of a hydraulic fluid in the direction of a wheel brake is performed by means of a brake cylinder. The method comprises the step whereby an isolation valve which is assigned in terms of flow to the wheel brake and which is situated in a flow path of the hydraulic fluid is adjusted in the direction of a closed state in order to set a pressure difference between a region positioned upstream of the isolation valve in terms of flow and a region positioned downstream of the isolation valve in terms of flow. The present disclosure furthermore comprises a hydraulic brake system for a motor vehicle, a computer program product, a control unit and a motor vehicle.
