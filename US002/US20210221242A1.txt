abstract
    The patent presents Resilient In-Wheel-Motor (RIWM) technology with an enhanced scheme to control the regenerative power that can be delivered by hybrid and electric vehicles to be faster and with a lower total cost than other electric drive systems. Hub motors have been included a built-in inverter, control electronics, software and smart battery management that simplify the adoption of hybrid and electrified powertrains across a broad range of vehicles, based on add new performance feature to handle some existing challenges that will be mentioned bellow. The objective of the paper is to propose hub motor that is incorporated with high-speed dynamic energy storage as fast batteries, ultracapacitors and small flywheel units. That can achieve integrated hub motor system that will be reflected in enhanced structure to each component of electric vehicle systems, in addition to, Interior Search Algorithm (ISA) will be applied to control and optimize the performance parameters.
