abstract
    Renewable electricity, such as from solar or wind, powers a topping cycle utilizing combustion energy electricity generation, such that the electricity output of the system exceeds the combined standalone outputs. Renewable carbon, such as from biomass, can also power a similar topping cycle, having the same effect.
