abstract
    An electrical source control apparatus controls a vehicle which travels by using an electrical source system including a first electrical source and a second electrical source. The electrical source control apparatus has: a controlling device for controlling the first and second electrical sources to set a residual power level of the first electrical source equal to first target amount and to set a residual power level of the second electrical source equal to second target amount, and a setting device for setting the first and second target amounts such that each of the first and second target amounts becomes smaller as a speed of the vehicle becomes larger. The setting device sets the first and second target amounts such that a rate of change of the second target amount to the speed is larger than a rate of change of the first target amount to the speed.
