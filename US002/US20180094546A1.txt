abstract
    This application provides a fast frequency response system for use with combined cycle power plants. Example systems may include a buffer vessel configured to store steam, a heat recovery steam generator configured to output a high pressure steam flow and a hot reheat steam flow, and a steam turbine configured to receive the high pressure steam flow and/or a reheat pressure steam flow. The buffer vessel may be configured to receive a portion of the high pressure steam flow and discharge steam.
