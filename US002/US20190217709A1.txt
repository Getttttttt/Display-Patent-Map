abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for operating a hybrid vehicle during operating conditions where vehicle braking is requested. In one example, regenerative braking is allocated to vehicle wheels responsive to actual and estimated vehicle yaw. Additionally, friction braking torque is allocated to vehicle wheels responsive to requested braking torque and regenerative braking torques.
