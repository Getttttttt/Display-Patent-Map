abstract
    Implementations described and claimed herein provide systems and methods for providing energy to a defined space, such as a house or other building. In one implementation, thermal energy is received from a solar power source at a solar boiler, and steam is generated from the thermal energy using the solar boiler. One or pistons of a steam engine is driven with a pressure from the steam. The steam engine outputs a first waste heat. The first waste heat is received from the steam engine at a chiller. The chiller generates conditioned air from the first waste heat.
