abstract
    A system and method of recovering waste heat from an engine when the engine is not operating, which includes connecting a heater core to source of fluid heated due to operation of the engine with fluid lines, the flow of fluid from the source of heated fluid controlled by one or more pump, and operating the pumps when the engine is not operating to circulate the fluid from the source of heated fluid through the heater core. A second aspect includes a portable heat recovery system.
