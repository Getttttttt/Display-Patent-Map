abstract
    A control system for a vehicle includes an electric drive system associated with a first set of wheels. The electric drive system is configured to selectively provide electric motive power to the first set of wheels to propel the vehicle and electric retarding to slow the vehicle. The system further includes a friction brake system associated with one of the first set of wheels or a second set of wheels, a drive system control unit, and a friction brake control unit in electrical communication with the drive system control unit. The drive system control unit is configured to communicate with the friction brake control unit to control an amount of friction brake application during vehicle stops and starts on grade.
