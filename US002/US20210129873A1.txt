abstract
    Modifying railcar embodiments convert the dead weight of empty railcars to productive use. Battery embodiments are charged by regenerative brakes, solar panels, and wind turbines. Freight car wheels, have a plurality of regenerative brakes. A plurality of airfoils, with solar panels, are installed on shipping containers, to counteract drag created by a plurality of wind turbines. Railcar embodiments are used in a mix and match fashion, as desired. Storage battery banks, are shipped and/or charged to replace existing hazardous transmission lines. Storage battery banks, are shipped and/or charged to avoid constructing new transmission lines for solar or wind farms. Factory installed EV batteries, EV batteries, and/or other rechargeable batteries, are shipped and/or charged. After battery embodiment charging is complete, power generated is diverted to train engines. Provisions are made for embodiments not connected to train engines. Embodiment operations are monitored with data displays.
