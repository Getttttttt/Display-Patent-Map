abstract
    An improved electrocatalytic system utilizes an Organic Rankine cycle system to take advantage of exhaust fume heat to convert a working fluid to steam used in a steam expander to generate electricity. The generated electricity is then used in electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen gases used as a supplemental fuel in an internal combustion (IC) engine. Thereby, the improved electrocatalytic system provides an efficient, less costly and retrofittable system for reducing harmful emissions and fossil fuel consumption in vehicles.
