abstract
    An equipment determination method of a cogeneration system includes the steps of: calculating a total hot water supply load for each day over a predetermined period longer than a specific period based on each unit hot water supply load for hour according to hot water supply use by consumers; setting as a representative period a specific period on which the total hot water supply load becomes at least a low load among the calculated total hot water supply load for each day; determining a capacity of the cogeneration equipment based on the total hot water supply load on the set representative period; and determining a capacity of the plurality of hot water storage tanks based on an amount of hot water supply load exceeding the capacity of the determined cogeneration equipment among each unit hot water supply load for two or more divided periods including the set representative period.
