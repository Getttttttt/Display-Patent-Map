abstract
    A bicycle configurable for operating using a speed based control system and scheme or a torque based control system and scheme. A speed sensor or a torque sensor may detect an operating characteristic of the bicycle and a controller may determine whether to operate using a speed based control system and scheme or a torque based control system and scheme based on the operating characteristic. A signal from a speed sensor or a torque sensor may be used for determining the mechanical limits of a CVT range and when to incorporate an electric motor.
