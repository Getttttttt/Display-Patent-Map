abstract
    A steam generator having a channel for circulating heated fluid through a heat exchanger and having a channel for supplying water through the heat exchanger. The steam side of the heat exchanger is maintained at a pressure lower than the outside atmosphere and is heated by the heating fluid to a temperature more than the boiling point of the water at the lowered pressure. The water being introduced to the heat exchanger is heated to a boil. The steam produced is less than the boiling point of water in the atmosphere. A vacuum pump draws the steam from the heat exchanger and ejects the steam through a steam hose into atmospheric pressure. This rise in pressure is accompanied by a rise in temperature of the steam above the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure.
