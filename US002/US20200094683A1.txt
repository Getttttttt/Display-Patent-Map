abstract
    There is provided a method for controlling an electric vehicle. The method includes receiving a regenerative braking activation indicator. If the regenerative braking activation indicator is affirmative, the method includes applying regenerative braking at an initial level to an electric motor of the electric vehicle. The method also includes obtaining a vehicle motion parameter of the electric vehicle measured when the regenerative braking is being applied. In addition, the method includes changing the regenerative braking to a modified level based on the vehicle motion parameter.
