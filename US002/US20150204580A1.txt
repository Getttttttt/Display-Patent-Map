abstract
    A system for establishing a boiler fluid set point includes a plurality of input devices providing input values for a plurality of different portions of a heating system and a controller determining that during a period of time there was always at least one input value that deviated from a set point for the input value by more than a threshold amount and in response, the controller increasing the boiler fluid set point.
