abstract
    A prime mover with recovered energy driven compression for stationary and motor vehicle application. Efficient low compression operation, especially beneficial to small gas turbines, is enabled with either ambient or cryogenic intake air. Two features, exhaust gas recirculation by a jet-compressor and a heat of fusion sink to liquefy motive air to the jet-compressor, decrease regenerative heat exchanger terminal temperature difference relative to turbine temperature drop in low pressure operation while reducing heat exchanger surface area.
