abstract
    A continuous heating furnace includes a furnace main body, a conveyance unit configured to convey a baking object W in the furnace main body, a plurality of heating sections heated by combustion, each having a first radiation surface configured to be heated by combustion and transfers heat to the baking object conveyed by the conveyance unit and arranged in the conveyance direction of the baking object in the furnace main body, and a cooling preheater having a second radiation surface configured to receive radiant heat from the baking object when being opposite to the baking object conveyed by the conveyance unit and a gas flow path configured to preheat a gas used for combustion in the heating section by the heat from the second radiation surface.
