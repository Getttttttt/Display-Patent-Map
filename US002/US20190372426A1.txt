abstract
    The present invention is directed to a Cross-over Electro-Magnetic Engine system and method for making a Cross-over Electro-Magnetic Engine. More particularly, two types of Cross-over Electro-Magnetic Engine systems are disclosed having two types of electromagnetic generator mechanisms, a wheel drive power control box, a storage battery and/or capacitor, wheel gear drives connected to magnetic motors, an ignition module and an electric braking system with back-up mechanical brakes. Power from the cross-over electro-magnetic engine is transferred to the generator systems having rotating plates or counter-rotating plates, then transferred to the wheel drive power control box where it is sent to the magnetic motors to drive wheel gear drives for each wheel driven.
