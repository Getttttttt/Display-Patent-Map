abstract
    An opening-closing body control device for a vehicle includes: an opening-closing control unit configured to control an operation of an opening-closing body provided in an opening portion of a vehicle by controlling energization of a motor serving as a drive source. When the opening-closing body being moved based on a driving force of the motor is to be stopped, the opening-closing control unit sets a free running period during which free rotation of the motor is allowed, and executes brake control for generating a braking force in the motor after the free running period elapses.
