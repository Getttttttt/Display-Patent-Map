abstract
    A method of dynamic speed modulation in extended braking applications in a battery-powered electric vehicle is disclosed. The method includes determining a sensed parameter of the battery, and determining a parameter threshold of the battery. If the sensed parameter of the battery is the same or exceeds the parameter threshold, decreasing the groundspeed of the vehicle to a predetermined safe speed. If the sensed parameter of the battery is below the parameter threshold, determining the change in the parameter which would be caused by the regenerative braking system at the current groundspeed of the vehicle. If the change in the parameter would cause the sensed parameter to remain, reach or exceed the parameter threshold, correspondingly decreasing or increasing the groundspeed of the vehicle to cause the sensed parameter to approximate but not exceed the parameter threshold of the battery. A controller and electric vehicle capable of same, are also disclosed.
