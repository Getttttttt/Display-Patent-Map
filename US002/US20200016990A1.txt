abstract
    An on-board charging system for electric vehicles provides a source of electric charging power to even when the electric vehicle is not in motion. The charging system includes a free rolling axle supporting at least one driven ground wheel to power an electric generator. An electric charge is produced by the generator when driven by the free rolling axle and is stored in a plant battery. An inverter and a charger are selectively coupled to a battery pack that provides the motive power to the electric vehicle. A controller selectively charges the battery pack when it detects a predetermined charge state of the battery pack.
