abstract
    The device and method of the invention are adapted to control temperature and humidity of the air in some defined volume such as a room in a house. The device consists of a quantity of hygroscopic material and means for passing air past or through the material. Direct temperature and humidity control occur when air is conditioned (heated and dried by sorption heating, or cooled and humidified by absorption cooling) and sent inside the room; indirect control is also possible, by affecting the temperature of the walls (the sorption material may occupy channels or spaces within the walls, which are then heated/cooled, indirectly heating/cooling the air in the room by conduction). A fan or blower will allow for forced convection of air in a desired path (e.g from outside the house, over/through the sorption material, and into the house, or in the opposite direction). A second fan and valves allow for more complex operations.
