abstract
    A heat exchanger includes a plate with an external surface, a channel, and a nozzle. The external surface bounds an interior of the plate. The channel is disposed in the heat exchanger and passes through a portion of the interior. The nozzle is integrally disposed in the heat exchanger, extends through a portion of the external surface, and is fluidly connected to the channel. The nozzle is configured to transport a liquid from the channel, through the external surface, and to distribute the liquid onto a portion of the heat exchanger.
