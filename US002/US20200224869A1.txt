abstract
    A rotary cascading bed combustion system for converting waste product into energy includes a rotary cascading bed combustor boiler including a rotating cylinder surrounding a combustion chamber; the rotating cylinder being structured and disposed for cascading the fuel to facilitate the mixing of air and solids, wherein the rotational speed of the rotating cylinder is selectively varied based on the amount of fuel, airflow and combustion properties; wherein combusting waste is mixed with sorbents and cycled through a plurality of combustion zones to produce controlled heat for generating steam; wherein the steam is routed to a turbine; and wherein if carbon burnout is not complete it will be recycled back into the combustion chamber.
