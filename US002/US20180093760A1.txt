abstract
    A flight control pump system includes an electrical machine configured to operate in a motor mode and in a generator mode. A pump is operatively connected to be driven by the electrical machine in the motor mode. An overriding clutch is operatively connected to the electrical machine and to the pump to transfer torque from a main transmission to drive the pump and the electrical machine in the generator mode, and to decouple the main transmission from the electrical machine and the pump in the motor mode.
