abstract
    A boiler comprises a boiler gas exhaust providing an exhaust for recuperated gases; and a secondary heat exchanger comprising: an economizer cold fluid inlet connected to a source of cold fluid; an economizer cold fluid outlet fluidly connected to the economizer cold fluid inlet and located thereabove, the cold fluid circulating upwardly from the economizer cold fluid inlet towards the economizer cold fluid outlet; a hot gas inlet for receiving the recuperated gases from the boiler gas exhaust; and a hot gas outlet fluidly connected to the hot gas inlet through the secondary heat exchanger, the recuperated gases circulating from the hot gas inlet toward the hot gas outlet; wherein the recuperated gases cross the secondary heat exchanger and exhaust by the hot gas outlet, the cold fluid being heated between the economizer cold fluid inlet and the economizer cold fluid outlet thereby resulting in a preheated fluid.
