abstract
    A vehicle 100 (FIG. 1) includes a braking system 100 a (FIG. 2) that includes a foundation braking system 111 and a hydraulic braking system 112. According to method 100 b (FIGS. 3 and 4), system controller 117 (FIG. 2) at successive steps 120-127 determines when hydraulic regenerative braking system 112 cannot provide full commanded braking torque and acts through proportional treadle valve 116 a to provide a proportional transition between an isolated hydraulic braking mode and an isolated foundation braking mode. According to methods 200 b (FIGS. 7-8) and 200 b (FIGS. 9-10), proportional braking is approximated. According to method 300 (FIG. 11), hydraulic braking is reduced at the initiation of a braking event based upon the estimated kinetic energy of the vehicle and available capacity for storing that energy.
