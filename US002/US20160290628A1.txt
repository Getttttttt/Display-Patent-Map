abstract
    An apparatus, system, and method for controlling combustion gas output in direct steam generation for oil recovery. A direct combustion steam generator burns a fuel and an oxygen-containing gas mixture to produce combustion products including steam, CO2 and N2. Supplemental oxygen is separately supplied to the combustion steam generator to adjust the oxygen content of the oxygen-containing gas mixture during the combustion process in order to adjust the ratio of CO2 to N2 produced in the combustion products.
