abstract
    A metallurgical heat treating system with heat recovery is disclosed herein. The metallurgical heat treating system includes a conveyor, a first furnace, a second furnace, a cooling section, a preheating section, and a heat recovery duct. The conveyor conveys material in a conveying direction. The first furnace, the second furnace, the cooling section, and the preheating section are in thermal communication with the conveyor. The second furnace is disposed downstream of the first furnace in the conveying direction. The cooling section is disposed downstream of the second furnace in the conveying direction. The preheating section is disposed upstream of the first furnace in the conveying direction. The heat recovery duct is in fluid communication with the cooling section and the preheating section for a convective transfer of heat therebetween.
