abstract
    A method for allowing electric car batteries to produce minimal amounts of charge as it is driven so that the vehicle can deliver longer ranges in between charges comprises of the following steps: generating kinetic energy at approximately 7 mph from wheels in motion; the kinetic energy is then converted into electric energy by a generator; a transformer would increase the voltage and send the energy to an internal charging port using a supply wire.
