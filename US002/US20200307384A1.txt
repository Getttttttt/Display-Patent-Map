abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric machine and a controller. The electric machine is configured to draw energy from a battery to propel the vehicle and to recharge the battery during regenerative braking. The controller is programmed to, in response to identifying a regenerative braking opportunity along an upcoming road segment based on a classification of driver behavior and a classification of the upcoming road segment, operate the electric machine to recharge the battery along the upcoming road segment.
