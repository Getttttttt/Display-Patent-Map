abstract
    Systems and methods directed to improved battery management, motor control, energy storage and battery charging. The systems and methods enable vehicle electrification and provides a paradigm changing platform that enables integration of battery management, charging and motor controls with means to manage regenerative braking, traction and handling. In embodiments, systems and methods are directed to a unified modular battery pack system having a cascaded architecture comprising an integrated combination of a networked low voltage converter/controller with peer-to-peer communication capability, embedded ultra-capacitor or other secondary energy storage element, battery management system and serially connected set of individual cells as the fundamental building block.
