abstract
    A condensing gas-fired furnace has a furnace cabinet, a primary heat exchanger, a secondary heat exchanger located upstream relative to the primary heat exchanger with regard to location within a circulation airflow path, a first baffle carried by a first wall of the furnace cabinet, a second baffle carried by a second wall of the furnace cabinet, wherein the second baffle is located opposite the first baffle, and wherein the second wall is located opposite the first wall, and a third baffle carried by a third wall of the furnace cabinet, wherein the third baffle is located adjacent to the first baffle and the second baffle, and wherein the third wall is located adjacent to the first wall and the second wall.
