abstract
    A method for operating a heat recovery system for the utilization of waste heat of a heat engine of the heat recovery system may include discharging a carrier fluid via the heat engine, feeding the carrier fluid to an evaporator of a cyclic process of the heat recovery system, vaporizing a working fluid of the cyclic process via the evaporator and the waste heat, feeding the working fluid to an expansion engine of the cyclic process after vaporizing the working fluid, determining at least one carrier state variable of the carrier fluid at the evaporator, and setting at least one operating parameter of the heat recovery system based on the at least one determined carrier state variable.
