abstract
    To provide a pyrolysis apparatus capable of pyrolyzing an object to be treated without releasing exhaust gas to the atmosphere. This pyrolysis apparatus includes: a treatment furnace having a pyrolysis section where an object to be treated is subjected to pyrolysis on a grate; a purification water tank retaining water and having a gas pool formed in an upper part thereof; a primary purification tank connected to the upper part of the purification water tank, in which water is jetted toward exhaust gas flowing in from an upper part of the treatment furnace through a gas flue; a piping through which gas is taken up from the gas pool of the purification water tank and returned to the primary purification tank; a secondary purification tank connected to the upper part of the purification water tank, in which water is jetted toward the gas taken up from the gas pool of the purification water tank; and a return piping through which the gas having passed the secondary purification tank is fed into the treatment furnace.
