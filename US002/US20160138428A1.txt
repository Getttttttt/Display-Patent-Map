abstract
    A system includes a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) including a first pressure economizer, a first pressure evaporator that may receive a first portion of a feed water from the first pressure economizer at a first pressure, a re-heat section that may receive the first portion of the feed water from the first pressure economizer as a first steam flow, and a flash system including a first flash vessel that may receive a second portion of the feed water from the first pressure economizer and to generate a first flash steam flow. The system may combine the first flash steam flow with the first steam flow of the feed water at a second pressure less than the first pressure.
