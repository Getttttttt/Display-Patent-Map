abstract
    An economizer controller calibration method, comprising: sealing an economizer perimeter gap between the economizer frame and a Heating, Ventilating Air Conditioning (HVAC) system cabinet to reduce an uncontrolled outdoor airflow; determining a functional relationship between an economizer actuator voltage (x) and a damper position Outdoor Airflow Fraction (OAF) (y); monitoring the economizer actuator voltage (x) and measuring at least one airflow characteristic to calculate the damper position OAF (y) and obtain a set of x-versus-y data for at least two damper positions: closed, intermediate, and fully-open; calculating at least two coefficients of the functional relationship using the x-versus-y data; calculating a target economizer actuator voltage (xt) as a function of a required OAFr (yr) using the functional relationship; and positioning the damper using the target economizer actuator voltage (xt) to provide the target damper position OAFr (yr) within a tolerance of the required OAFr (yr).
