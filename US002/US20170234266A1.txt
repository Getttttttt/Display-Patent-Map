abstract
    Provided is a waste heat recovery power generation system, including: a compressor configured to compress a working fluid; a heat exchanger configured to recover waste heat from waste heat gas supplied from a waste heat source, the recovered waste heat heating the working fluid; a turbine configured to be driven by the working fluid heated by the recovered waste heat; and a recuperator configured to exchange heat between an output fluid of the turbine and an output fluid of the compressor to cool the output fluid of the turbine in which the output fluid of the compressor is branched into a first output fluid and a second output fluid of the compressor.
