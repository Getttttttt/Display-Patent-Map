abstract
    A brake system is described for a vehicle having a master brake cylinder that is hydraulically connected to at least one wheel brake caliper, and having a fluid conveyor device by which brake fluid can be transferred into the at least one wheel brake caliper and out of the at least one wheel brake caliper, the fluid conveyor device including a pump motor that is controllable in two directions of rotation, the motor being capable of being controlled in such a way that brake fluid can optionally be pumped by the fluid conveyor device either out of a fluid storage device into the at least one wheel brake caliper or out of the at least one wheel brake caliper into the fluid storage device. In addition, also described is a method for operating a brake system of a vehicle.
