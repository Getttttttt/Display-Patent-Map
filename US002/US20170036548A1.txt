abstract
    A MG-ECU includes, as a regeneration limiting value, a limited value set according to a state of a battery, and an unlimited value enabling generation of braking force greater than the limited value. In a state in which regenerative braking is being limited, the MG-ECU causes frictional braking force to be generated based on a difference between the unlimited value and the drive force demand of a driver. In cases in which the frictional braking force is also limited in a state of the regenerative braking, the MG-ECU switches the regeneration limiting value from the limited value to the unlimited value, and requests a motor-generator to generate regenerative braking based on the limited value.
