abstract
    Device for removing moisture and/or another substance from ambient air or from a gas, the device being configured to operate alternately in an adsorption phase and a desorption phase. The device comprises a vessel comprising an entry and an exit which comprise valves allowing the exit and entry to be opened and closed and a body of adsorption material positioned inside the vessel dividing the inside of the vessel in an upstream region and a downstream region. The device further comprises a condenser loop comprising a condenser located outside the vessel, a branch conduit which extends from the vessel to the condenser and which allows a branch flow of air or gas to flow from the downstream region to the condenser, and a condenser return conduit which extends from the condenser to the vessel and which allows the branch flow to return from the condenser to the upstream region of the vessel. The device further comprises at least one main return conduit for returning a main return flow of air or gas from the downstream region to the upstream region while bypassing the condenser.
