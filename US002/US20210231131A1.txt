abstract
    An inertia-based energy storage device with a fluid pressure regulating function and an energy storage method. The device comprises a vacuum vessel (1), a pressure regulating vessel, a pressure transmission member, a kinetic energy recovery device and a hydraulic generator. The energy storage method comprises: providing a fluid which is liquid or compressed gas; accelerating the fluid and thereafter decelerating the fluid; recovering deceleration kinetic energy of the fluid in decelerating the fluid; in the process of accelerating or decelerating the fluid, regulating an pressure of the fluid from a first pressure to a second pressure depending on a rate of change in velocity and a state of motion of the fluid. The energy storage device can regulate the pressure of fluid during the inertia-based energy storage process and extract the pressure energy of fluid after pressure regulation.
