abstract
    A vehicle internal combustion engine arrangement includes an internal combustion reciprocating piston engine, and an exhaust line capable of collecting exhaust gases from the engine, a waste heat recovery system carrying a working fluid in a loop, in which the working fluid is successively compressed, heated in a heat exchanger by at least one engine fluid, and expanded in a first expander, a first compressor located in the exhaust line and mechanically connected to the first expander of the waste heat recovery system.
