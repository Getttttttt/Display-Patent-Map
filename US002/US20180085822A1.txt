abstract
    A method and apparatus for measuring quench characteristics of a fluid. The apparatus includes a probe with an energy input device electrically connected to a display unit to monitor temperature, media flow characteristics and media heat transfer characteristics. The method includes continuously measuring thermal energy transfer in a quenching media by measuring the surrounding fluid's heat transfer relative to input probe energy.
