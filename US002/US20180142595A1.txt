abstract
    An engine with an SCR catalyst aftertreatment system includes a turbocharger exhaust duct in fluid communication with the turbocharger outlet and a heating loop segment including an inlet and an outlet. The inlet and the outlet are in fluid communication with the exhaust duct, and the inlet extracts a portion of exhaust gases from the exhaust duct. The engine further includes an exhaust pressure driven air amplifier, an electric preheater, a fuel injector, an oxidation catalyst, a urea injector, and a temperature sensor on the heating loop segment.
