abstract
    The invention relates to a method for controlling a vehicle (1) equipped with a means (10) for recuperating the energy generated under braking, comprising steps of acquiring a braking instruction, calculating a first intermediate setpoint using a preventive filter which filters said braking instruction at the resonant frequency of the drive train (20) of the vehicle (1), calculating a second intermediate setpoint, formulated so as to damp out the oscillations in the drive train (20) using a curative filter, controlling said regenerative means (10) on the basis of said first and second intermediate setpoints, and controlling the brakes (60, 70). According to the invention, the second intermediate setpoint is calculated as a function of a forecast value of a dynamic characteristic of the recuperative means, estimated using a predictive mathematical model.
