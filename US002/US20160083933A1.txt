abstract
    An articulated work vehicle with a regenerative hydraulic circuit may comprise a front chassis, a rear chassis, first and second hydraulic cylinders each with head and rod chambers and each pivotally connected to the front chassis and the rear chassis, and an articulation joint. The rod chamber of the second hydraulic cylinder may be hydraulically connected to the head chamber of the first hydraulic cylinder via a flow restrictor. The rod chamber of the second hydraulic cylinder may also be hydraulically connected to a hydraulic source via a check valve which is configured to allow hydraulic flow into the rod chamber of the second hydraulic cylinder. The articulation joint may pivotally connect the front chassis to the rear chassis. The articulation joint may be laterally positioned between the first hydraulic cylinder and the second hydraulic cylinder.
