abstract
    The present invention relates to a waterless system and method for cooling a metallurgical processing furnace. Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) is used as a coolant, as opposed to water, which provides several advantages. For example, sCO2 can be used at higher temperatures, the risk of an explosion (with use of water) is eliminated, there are no problems with regard to reverse solubility of water at higher temperatures that can foul passageways, and smaller cooling passages can be used thus reducing the cost of cooling panels. A system is disclosed which uses a reservoir to store the sCO2, a compressor or pump to cause the delivery of the sCO2 to cooling passages in the furnace, a pressure reducing valve or a turbine to decrease the pressure of the sCO2, and a heat exchanger to cool the sCO2 to a liquid state as the sCO2 travels back to the reservoir.
