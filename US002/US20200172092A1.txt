abstract
    A vehicle is provided to improve driving and pedestrian safety. The vehicle includes a position receiver that receives a position of the vehicle and a communicator that receives map information including Green Zone position information. A controller operates the vehicle to travel in a Green Zone mode from a section start point of a Green Zone to a section end point of the Green Zone when it is predicted that the vehicle enters the Green Zone from the position of the vehicle received from the position receiver.
