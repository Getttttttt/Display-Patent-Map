abstract
    An energy conversion apparatus for a freezer includes a housing having a first region therein for receiving liquid CO2 for providing potential energy; a movable member rotatably mounted to the housing and having a second region in fluid communication with the first region and constructed to receive the liquid CO, for providing kinetic energy from which mechanical work is provided to rotate the movable member; and a discharge member connected to the movable member and having a third region in fluid communication with the second region, the third region continuing the mechanical work when exhausting the liquid CO2 such that the liquid CO2 is changed to a CO2 snow.
