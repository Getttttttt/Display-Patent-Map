abstract
    A number of variations may include a system which may include an electrified turbocharger along with a waste heat recovery system which may have at least a first boiler operably coupled to a vehicle engine system in order to recover waste heat therefrom. The waste heat recovery system may additionally include at least one waste heat recovery expander. The waste heat recovery system may be operably coupled to a turbocharged system which may have at least one electrified turbocharger. The electrified turbocharger and the waste heat recovery expander may be electrically coupled to a single electric machine.
