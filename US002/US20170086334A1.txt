abstract
    A point to multipoint closed loop chilled water and refrigerant distribution and control system used to distribute chilled water to air handling systems used to supply cold air ventilation to data center rooms and to the electronic equipment mounted therein which require constant cooling by using a control system controlling variable speed pumps, fans, compressors and condensers to operate a closed loop, variable flow refrigerant system and a plurality of associated closed loop water systems working in conjunction with heat exchangers to provide chilled water to interior air handling systems, provide hot water to heating applications and to provide radiant heat or forced air heating to other occupied spaces where desirable within a building containing a data center.
