abstract
    A heat source integrated air conditioner, which includes a freezer, a cooling tower, and a device for heating and is integrated up to heat source supply equipment to be capable of supplying cooling and heating as well as dehumidification, humidification, and ventilation is provided. The heat source integrated air conditioner is formed on an upper side of one frame and installed outside or on a rooftop of a building, thereby reducing time and cost for manufacturing, installation and maintenance, increasing utilization of a space inside a building, reducing heat loss and appliance costs by minimizing piping distance, and creating a pleasant indoor environment, and also enhancing utilization of a space inside the building and maximizing energy saving during operation of cooling/heating.
