abstract
    Pyrolysis methods and apparatuses that allow effective heat removal, for example when necessary to achieve a desired throughput or process a desired type of biomass, are disclosed. According to representative methods, the use of a quench medium (e.g., water), either as a primary or a secondary type of heat removal, allows greater control of process temperatures, particularly in the reheater where char, as a solid byproduct of pyrolysis, is combusted. Quench medium may be distributed to one or more locations within the reheater vessel, such as above and/or within a dense phase bed of fluidized particles of a solid heat carrier (e.g., sand) to better control heat removal.
