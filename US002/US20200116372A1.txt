abstract
    Methods and systems for controlling temperature and humidity within a space in a building. Outdoor air and return air from the space are passed through particular equipment in a particular order. Equipment includes a secondary direct-expansion refrigeration circuit, a recovery wheel, a primary cooling coil or direct-expansion refrigeration circuit, secondary circuit coils, and a dehumidification wheel. Various embodiments include modulating the secondary circuit compressor to adjust reheat capacity at the secondary circuit condenser coil, a geothermal direct-expansion refrigeration circuit, a variable refrigerant flow subsystem, fan coil units, multiple zones, a dedicated outdoor air supply subsystem, an evaporative cooler, supplemental outdoor air, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, supply air passes first through the recovery wheel, then through the primary cooling coil, then through the dehumidification wheel, and then to the space. Further, in some embodiments, exhaust air passes through the dehumidification wheel, and then through the recovery wheel.
