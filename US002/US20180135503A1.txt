abstract
    A waste heat recovery (WHR) and coolant system with active coolant pressure control includes an engine cooling system, a WHR system, and a coolant pressure control system. A coolant heat exchanger positioned along each of the engine cooling and working fluid circuits, and is structured to transfer heat from the coolant fluid to the working fluid. The coolant pressure control system includes a pressure line operatively coupled to an air brake system and to the coolant tank. A valve is coupled to the pressure line upstream of the coolant tank. A coolant pressure controller is in operative communication with each of the valve, an air pressure sensor, and a coolant temperature sensor. The coolant pressure controller is structured to determine a target coolant pressure based on a coolant temperature and control a valve position of the valve so as to cause the air pressure to approach the target coolant pressure.
