abstract
    An energy exchange system is configured to provide dry supply air to an enclosed structure. The system may include an energy transfer device having a first portion configured to be disposed within a supply air flow path and a second portion configured to be disposed within a regeneration air flow path. The energy transfer device is configured to decrease a humidity level of supply air. The energy transfer device is configured to be regenerated with regeneration air. The system may also include a first heat exchanger configured to be disposed within the supply air flow path downstream from the energy transfer device and within the regeneration air flow path upstream from the second portion of the energy transfer device. The first heat exchanger is configured to transfer sensible energy between the supply air and the regeneration air. The supply air is configured to be supplied to the enclosed structure after passing through the energy transfer device and the first heat exchanger.
