abstract
    A plate heat exchanger having a plurality of plates with sinusoidal undulations and two chimneys positioned at two opposite corners of the plates. Modules are formed by assembling together pairs of plates, the modules being stacked so as to make contact via the inlet and outlet chimneys in order to form the heat exchanger. The sinusoidal undulations form a first angle β with the flow direction of the fluids in the heat exchanger, the first angle β increasing in the flow direction of a first fluid through the modules. Furthermore, each plate has two distribution zones for distributing the first fluid in the modules in the proximity of each inlet or outlet chimney in order to make the filling and the discharge of the modules by the first fluid more uniform.
