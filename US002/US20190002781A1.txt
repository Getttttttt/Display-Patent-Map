abstract
    Biomass is processed into a slurry (Heavy Biofuel Oil or HBFO) comprising a fuel slurry suitable for low and medium speed diesel engines or other suitable power equipment that is produced by subjecting biomass feedstock to steam explosion processing, washing and separating unwanted materials, micronization to a targeted size, de-ashing with high pressure steam combined with micronization, and separation by means of classification of unwanted materials and a slurrification processes to make the HBFO suitable for use in internal combustion engines, such as diesel engine systems.
