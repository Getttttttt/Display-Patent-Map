abstract
    An electronic system for controlling traction and braking of a vehicle is described. The system includes a device for actuating braking operatively connected to at least one first wheel of the vehicle, and at least one first traction and braking control unit. The device comprises: at least one first electric actuator and at least one electric motor. The at least one first traction and braking control unit being configured to control the at least one electric motor in regeneration mode to exert a regenerative braking torque on at least one first wheel. The at least one first traction and braking control unit also being configured to control the at least one electric motor in traction mode to exert a traction torque on the at least one first wheel.
