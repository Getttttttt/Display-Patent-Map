abstract
    A charging system and method for charging a battery of a vehicle is disclosed. The charging system includes a movable member, such as a wind-driven element. The charging system also includes means for exposing the wind-driven element during vehicle deceleration and for covering the wind-driven element during vehicle acceleration and coasting. The charging system further includes electrical power generating means operably associated with the wind-driven element and the battery such that the electrical power generating means provides electrical power for recharging the battery when the electrical power generating means receives mechanical power from the wind-driven element. Alternative embodiments can include a drop-wheel as a movable member.
