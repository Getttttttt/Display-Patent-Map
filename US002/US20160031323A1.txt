abstract
    The present disclosure is related to a method to control a contactor tip assembly associated with a grid of an electric drive system is provided. The contactor tip assembly includes at least one first contactor tip and at least one second contactor tip. The method includes introducing a delay signal associated with an operation of at least one of the first contactor tip and the second contactor tip. Further, the operation includes a closing event and an opening event thereof. The method also includes controlling the operation of the first and second contactor tips in an alternate manner. Further, a delay is present between a sequential operation of one of the first and second contactor tips and the other of the first and second contactor tips based, at least in part, on the introduced delay signal.
