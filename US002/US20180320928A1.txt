abstract
    A heater having a burner, a first heat exchanger associated with the burner, a second heat exchanger above the first heat exchanger in fluid cooperation with the first heat exchanger and an ambient air intake blower above the second heat exchanger. The second heat exchanger comprises angularly disposed finned section so condensate within the second heat exchanger flows to a collection point and is collected in a trap. The trap includes a sensor to sense buildup of fluid in the trap with feedback to the heater controls. The heater may include a collection pan below the heat exchangers in fluid communication with the trap. In one aspect the collection pan may include a heating element to vaporize the fluid so that heated, humidified air is expelled through vents adjacent the base of the heater. In another aspect, the pan includes an ultrasonic vaporization element to vaporize fluid in the pan.
