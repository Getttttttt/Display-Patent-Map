abstract
    A regeneration control apparatus which controls a regenerative braking force of an electric motor for driving an electric motor vehicle includes: a regeneration operation unit operated by a driver to select magnitude of the regenerative braking force stepwise from selection stages; a default operation unit operated by the driver to change the magnitude of the regenerative braking force to one of the selection stages which has been set as a default stage; a detection unit detecting an operation state on the regeneration operation unit during a learning period; and a default stage changing unit, when one of the selection stages whose selection frequency is highest during the learning period is different from one of the selection stages which has been currently set as the default stage, changing the default stage to another selection stage.
