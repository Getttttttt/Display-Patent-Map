abstract
    An electric vehicle and a method for adjusting vehicle parameters based on a type of battery modules inserted into a vehicle. A processor is configured to: receive at least one input parameter from the battery modules housed in the vehicle; determine at least a type (e.g., lithium or lead acid) and capacity of the battery modules in the vehicle; and adjust output parameters to a battery management system and one or more vehicle subsystems based on the determined type and capacity of battery modules. Accordingly, battery packs can be swapped without updating electrical software in the vehicle. A customer can alternate from one type of battery pack module to another more easily and can obtain cost savings. The method can be implemented using CAN bus protocol.
