abstract
    An engine system with exhaust gas recirculation includes a combustion engine, a flow mixer, and a turbocharger. An exhaust flow path and a charge air flow path each extend to an inlet of the flow mixer, and a mixed gas flow path extends between the outlet of the flow mixer and an intake manifold of the engine. A charge air heat exchanger is arranged along the charge air flow path to cool the charge air, and a mixed gas heat exchanger is arranged along the mixed gas flow path to cool mixed charge air and recirculated exhaust gas. The exhaust gas recirculation flow path does not extend through any heat exchangers.
