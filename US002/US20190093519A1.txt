abstract
    A waste heat recovery system in thermal communication with an exhaust conduit of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle includes a condenser. The condenser includes a working fluid conduit configured to connect to a working fluid loop of the waste heat recovery system and a coolant fluid conduit configured to connect to a coolant fluid loop used to cool the internal combustion engine of the vehicle. The coolant fluid conduit includes a coolant fluid inlet and a coolant fluid outlet. The waste heat recovery system also includes a coolant fluid bypass fluidly connected between the coolant fluid inlet and the coolant fluid outlet. The coolant fluid bypass includes a coolant fluid control valve configured to vary a portion of the volume of coolant fluid that flows through the coolant fluid bypass based on a temperature of a working fluid in the working fluid loop.
