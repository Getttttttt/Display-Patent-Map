abstract
    An exhaust energy recovery system can include a hydraulic accumulator having an outer shell defining an internal volume containing an energy storage medium. The heat exchanger can be coupled to the outer shell and can selectively receive a flow of exhaust gas. The heat exchanger can have an inlet and outlet that can each be coupled to an exhaust pipe. A valve can be associated with the exhaust pipe upstream of the heat exchanger and a bypass passage can be in selective fluid communication with the valve to provide an exhaust gas flow path that bypasses the heat exchanger. The valve can be configured to: i) divert at least a portion of the exhaust gas through the heat exchanger thereby providing thermal energy to at least the energy storage medium of the accumulator, and/or ii) divert at least a portion of the exhaust gas through the bypass passage.
