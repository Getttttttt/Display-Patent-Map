abstract
    A control apparatus for a voltage conversion apparatus includes: duty command signal generation means for generating a duty command signal corresponding to a duty ratio of switching elements carrier signal generation means for generating carrier signals corresponding to respective switching frequencies of the switching elements; switching control signal generation means for generating respective switching control signals of switching ON and OFF states of the switching elements, by comparing the duty command signal with the carrier signals; one arm driving control means for implementing one arm driving by alternatively turning on the first and second switching elements; and phase inverting means for bringing phases of portions, of the carrier signals, corresponding to switching at least right after arm switching, into a state where the phases are shifted from each other by 180 degrees between the first and second switching elements, at the time of the arm switching.
