abstract
    A method for the direct reduction of feedstock, containing metal-oxide, to form metallic material, by contact with hot reduction gas in a reduction assembly (1): the product of the direct reduction process is discharged from the reduction assembly by a product discharge apparatus, which is flushed with seal gas, drawn off from the vent gas and subsequently dedusted. At least one portion of the dedusted vent gas is used as a combustion energy source during the production of the reduction gas, and/or as a component of a furnace fuel gas during a combustion process for heating the reduction gas, and/or as a component of the reduction gas. Apparatus for carrying out the method is disclosed.
