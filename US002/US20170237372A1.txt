abstract
    The present disclosure provides for a power system for a locomotive. The power system includes an engine, a first alternator, a second alternator and an inverter module. The first alternator operatively coupled to the engine and configured to provide electrical power to one or more traction motors. The second alternator operatively coupled to the engine and configured to provide electrical power to one or more auxiliary loads. The inverter module configured to selectively couple to an energy storage device to provide electrical power to the first alternator for cranking the engine and to a DC link to provide electrical power to the auxiliary load during regenerative braking of the traction motor.
