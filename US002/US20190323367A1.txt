abstract
    Systems and methods provide a flow distribution device that includes a duct for a heat recovery steam generators having a duct an expansion portion extending from an inlet portion. The expansion portion has a larger cross-sectional area than the inlet portion. The flow distribution device includes a guide vane having a curved surface. The guide vane is positioned in the duct to extend from at least a part of the inlet portion into the expansion portion.
