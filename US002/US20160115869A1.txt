abstract
    A method for operating a combined cycle power plant includes additional burners being arranged in the waste heat boiler, the burners being supplied with secondary air from the gas turbine, the gas turbine is operated without a supply of fuel, and driving is effected by means of a start-up inverter. A plant includes a waste heat boiler, additional burners for generating thermal energy being arranged within the waste heat boiler, a gas turbine designed such that the necessary air mass flow for the additional burners can be supplied by the gas turbine, wherein the gas turbine is operated without a supply of fuel, the plant further including a start-up inverter, wherein driving is effected by means of the start-up inverter.
