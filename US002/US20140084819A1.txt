abstract
    A controller for driving a motor has: an input part that receives, from each of two brake sensors, a signal indicating a corresponding brake is in an ON state or a signal indicating that the brake is in an OFF state; a control coefficient computing part that increases a control coefficient relative to a regeneration target value along a first slope when a first signal indicating only one of the brakes is in an ON state is received from the input part, the control coefficient computing part increasing the control coefficient along a second slope when a second signal indicating both brakes are in an ON state is received from the input part, the second slope rising faster than the first slope; and a control part controlling driving of the motor in accordance with the regeneration target value and the control coefficient computed by the control coefficient computing part.
