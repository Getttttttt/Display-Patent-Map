abstract
    An information pushing device includes an information emitting device and a plurality of power generation members. The information pushing device is configured to push wireless information to mobile terminal equipments. Each power generation member includes a strip-shaped of electric generation film and two electrodes formed on two opposite surface of the electric generation film. The electric generation film is made from piezoelectric material, the power generation member comprises a first end and a second end opposite to the first end. The electrodes of the first end is electrically connected with the power supply unit, the second end swings under a cool or a heated airflow and produces charge. The charge is stored in the electrodes and provided to the information emitting device.
