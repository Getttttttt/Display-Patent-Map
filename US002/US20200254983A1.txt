abstract
    A brake force control system configured to allow a driver to control brake force finely only by operating an accelerator pedal, and to decelerate a vehicle to a target speed only by operating the accelerator pedal. The control system calculates a target deceleration to travel through a target site at a target speed in accordance with a decelerating factor. If a reference deceleration generated by returning the accelerator pedal to an initial position is equal to or less than the target deceleration, the control system increases the reference deceleration.
