abstract
    An epicyclic transmission gear and disk brake based regenerative braking device includes an epicyclic transmission unit to transfer braking energy through arrangement of sun gear and the planetary gears to a clock spring of a clock spring torque storage module. The device includes a disk brake unit that arrests the rotation of a sun-planetary gear assembly in the epicyclic transmission unit such that momentum available at the extended hub is transferred to a ring gear. The ring gear is connected to an inner casing of the clock spring torque storage module that charges the spring. The device includes a chassis unit that dissipates excess energy through spinning of an outer casing of the clock spring torque storage module by a spring calibration wheel that rides over a sinusoidal contoured surface of the outer casing.
