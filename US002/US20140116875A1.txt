abstract
    A pyrometallurgical vessel for the production of metal by the electrolytic reduction of a metal bearing material dissolved in a molten salt bath, the cell including a shell 11 and a lining 12,13 on the interior of the shell, the lining including a bottom cathode lining 13 and a side wall lining 12, at least one of the bottom cathode lining 13 and a side wall lining 12 including a plurality of fluid ducts 16, 22, 31, 41 positioned within the lining for conducting a fluid therethrough, the flow of fluid through the ducts within the linings having 3-dimensional directional flow provided by 3-dimensional shapes inserted into the ducts or the ducts comprising a number of straight sections joined by curved sections arranged in a 3-dimensional shape, the 3-dimensional shapes of the ducts or the 3-dimensional shapes inserted into the ducts. The 3-D shapes in the ducts or the 3-D shape of the ducts are in such a way that secondary flows in the fluid are formed, broken and reformed imparting greater advection in the flow.
