abstract
    A combined cycle power plant includes a CO2 capture system operatively integrated with a liquefied natural gas LNG regasification system, where cold energy from the regasification process is used for cooling processes within the CO2 capture system or processes associated with it. These cooling systems include systems for cooling lean or rich absorption solutions for the CO2 capture or the cooling of flue gas. The LNG regasification system is arranged in one or more heat exchange stages having and one or more cold storage units. The power plant with CO2 capture can be operated at improved overall efficiencies.
