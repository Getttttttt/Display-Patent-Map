abstract
    A process for reducing pressure of a vapor stream used for reducing a temperature or pressure in a reactor. A pressure of a vapor stream is reduced with a turbine to provide a lower pressure vapor stream. The vapor stream rotates a turbine wheel within the turbine. The turbine wheel is configured to transmit rotational movement to an electrical generator. Thus, electricity is generated with the turbine. The lower pressure vapor stream is injected into a reactor and reduces a temperature in the reactor or reduces a partial pressure of a hydrocarbon vapor in the reactor.
