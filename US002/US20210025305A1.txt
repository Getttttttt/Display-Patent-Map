abstract
    A method is provided for operating an internal combustion engine in a motor vehicle, The internal combustion engine has at least one cylinder with a combustion chamber, a water injection unit with a tank and at least one injection nozzle for directly or indirectly injecting water into the combustion chamber, an exhaust gas system with at least one exhaust gas catalytic converter and a particulate filter device which has a particulate filter for filtering particles out of an exhaust gas flow guided in the exhaust gas system. A control unit is provide for a state monitoring process and for controlling the combustion in the cylinder.
