abstract
    A system for regenerating an emissions particulate filter that filters particulates from exhaust generated by an engine of a vehicle. The system includes an electric heater and a generator. The electric heater heats the emissions particulate filter to burn off exhaust particulates that have accumulated on the emissions particulate filter. The generator converts kinetic energy of the vehicle into electricity during regenerative braking of the vehicle. Electricity generated by the generator powers the electric heater. Energy used to power the electric heater can also come from engine load shifting.
