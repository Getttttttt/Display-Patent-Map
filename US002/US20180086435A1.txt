abstract
    A power supply apparatus for an aerospace actuator includes motor drive electronics for actuation of a motor for control of the aerospace actuator, and an energy storage device. The motor drive electronics are configured to receive input electrical energy from an aircraft power grid, receive electrical energy from the energy storage device and provide electrical energy from the grid and/or from the energy storage device to the motor. The energy storage device is configured to store at least one of: excess electrical energy supplied to the motor drive electronics from the grid and regenerated electrical energy from the motor drive electronics. The energy storage device is configured to discharge the stored energy as electrical energy to the motor drive electronics when required.
