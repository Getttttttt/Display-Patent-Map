abstract
    An Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) System has an LT working fluid loop and an HT working fluid loop. The working fluid loops may each have a pump, one or more heat exchanger boilers, an expander, and a condenser. A recuperator is arranged within the LT working fluid loop between the pump and the first heat exchanger boiler. The recuperator is also arranged within the HT working fluid loop between the expander and the pump, or within the LT working fluid loop between the expander and the condenser. One of the heat exchanger boilers in the LT loop may be a charge air cooler heat exchanger, and may receive charge air mixed with recirculating exhaust gas. The LT loop may include more than one heat exchanger boiler, arranged in series or in parallel. Bypass valves may selectively bypass one or more of the heat exchangers.
