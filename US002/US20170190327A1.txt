abstract
    A brake system for a vehicle having a master brake cylinder, which provides a pressure signal, having a brake-medium reservoir connected to the master brake cylinder, and a first brake circuit, which is coupled by a first input to the master brake cylinder and by a second input to the brake-medium reservoir, and having at least one first wheel-brake cylinder, which is mounted at a first wheel, in order to exert a force corresponding to the pressure signal onto the first wheel, and having a separator valve, which is configured between the first input and the first wheel-brake cylinder, to prevent further transmission of the pressure signal upon receipt of a supplied closing signal; and having a control valve, which is configured between the first input and the first wheel-brake cylinder; in order to control an inflow of a brake medium from brake-medium reservoir to the first wheel-brake cylinder. In addition, a method for controlling a corresponding brake system is also described.
