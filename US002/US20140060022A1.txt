abstract
    A hydraulic control system is disclosed for use with a machine. The hydraulic control system may have a tank, a pump, a swing motor, and at least one control. The hydraulic control system may further have an accumulator configured to receive fluid from and supply fluid to the swing motor, a charge valve movable to allow fluid flow from the swing motor into the accumulator, and a discharge valve movable to allow fluid flow from the accumulator to the swing motor. The hydraulic control system may additionally have a controller in communication with the at least one control valve, the charge valve, and the discharge valve. The controller may be configured to detect an acceleration of the swing motor, selectively cause the discharge valve to assist the acceleration, and selectively move the charge valve to an open position to recover energy associated with pressure spikes occurring during the acceleration.
