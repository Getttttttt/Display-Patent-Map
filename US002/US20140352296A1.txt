abstract
    A method and apparatus for operating an internal combustion engine, in particular for commercial vehicles, having a fuel/air feed device and a downstream exhaust system, wherein, to achieve improved efficiency, the exhaust gas enthalpy in the exhaust gas flow of the internal combustion engine is used to operate a heat engine, in particular a Stirling engine, which produces mechanical energy.
