abstract
    An electric power generation control device applied to a system including a generator capable of regenerative electric power generation, an electric power storage device capable of being charged with electric power, and a friction brake device that generates a braking force. The control device includes an operation amount acquisition unit that acquires a brake operation amount by the driver, an electric power generation amount acquisition units that increase a target electric power generation amount for the generator the larger the brake operation amount is, and have plural relationships of which the target electric power generation amounts that correspond to a certain brake amount differ, and acquire the target electric power generation amount according to one of the relationships based on change in the brake operation amount, and an electric power generation amount instruction unit that controls the generator based on the target electric power generation amount.
