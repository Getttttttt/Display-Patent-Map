abstract
    A method and system of processing animal waste is disclosed. In a particular embodiment, the method includes transferring animal waste to a gasifier to burn the animal waste, circulating water through a heat exchanger in a flue stack of the gasifier to generate heated water, and pumping the heated water to either an organic Rankine cycle system to generate electricity, a radiant heater, or any combination thereof. In addition, the method includes circulating the heated water through an evaporator of the organic Rankine cycle system to vaporize a refrigerant, and circulating the vaporized refrigerant from the evaporator, through a turbine to generate the electricity. Also, the method includes using a manure spreader to feed the animal waste to the gasifier at a varying feed rate that is based on contemporaneously calculating a British thermal units (BTU) of the animal waste being fed to the gasifier.
