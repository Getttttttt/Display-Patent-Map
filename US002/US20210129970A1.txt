abstract
    Disclosed is a re-liquefying device using a boil-off gas as a cooling fluid so as to reliquefy the boil-off gas generated from a liquefied gas storage tank provided in a ship. A boil-off gas re-liquefying device for a ship comprises: a multi-stage compression unit for compressing boil-off gas generated from a liquefied gas storage tank; a heat exchanger in which the boil-off gas generated from the storage tank and the boil-off gas compressed exchange heat; a vaporizer for heat exchanging the boil-off gas cooled by the heat exchanger and a separate liquefied gas supplied to a fuel demand source of a ship, and thus cooling the boil-off gas; an intermediate cooler for cooling the boil-off gas that has been cooled by the heat exchanger; and an expansion means for branching a part of the boil-off gas, which is supplied to the intermediate cooler, and expanding the same.
