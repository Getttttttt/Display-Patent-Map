abstract
    Provided is a vehicle braking force controller that can realize both improvement of passengers' riding comfort and feeling, and quick responsiveness, and that is excellent in stability against noise. The vehicle braking force controller provides a braking force command value in response to a stroke amount of a brake pedal operated by a driver, to a braking device which provides braking force to wheels. A stroke amount detection unit which detects a stroke amount inputted to the brake pedal is provided. A path-corresponding braking force command value changing unit is provided which changes the relationship between the stroke amount and the braking force command value determined based on the stroke amount, in response to an increase-decrease path that the stroke amount inputted from the brake pedal is following.
