abstract
    Systems and methods generate steam from produced water by passing the produced water through first and second steam generators coupled together. The first steam generator produces wet steam in which a liquid effluent with impurities of the produced water passes to the second steam generator. The second steam generator combusts fuel and oxidant in direct contact with the liquid effluent. The first and second steam generators limit fouling and waste while providing a combined steam output that may include combustion products from only the second steam generator.
