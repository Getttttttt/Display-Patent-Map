abstract
    A mobile air conditioner includes a circulation device for collecting hot wasted air and wasted water produced by the mobile air conditioner. The circulation device includes a water tank and a radiating pipe mounted in the water tank. The radiating pipe has a first end connected to an air blower and a second end connected to an air draining device. The air draining device has an outlet provided with an active carbon. The wasted water is collected in the water tank. The hot wasted air flows from the air blower into the radiating pipe which is immersed in the wasted water of the water tank. The hot wasted air is cooled by the wasted water and is filtered by the active carbon to release a clean air.
