abstract
    A water-to-air system using a modulating/proportionate control valve to regulate the amount of sensible reheat when operating in a dehumidification mode is disclosed. When in the reheat/dehumidification mode of operation, the modulating valve regulates the volume of water through a condenser coil to regulate refrigerant temperature to provide for sufficient reheating of the equipment supply air temperature within a narrow range, regardless of the inlet water temperature. The air conditioning system may be any type of water-cooled system, including a water source heat pump or water-cooled air conditioner.
