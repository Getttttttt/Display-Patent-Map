abstract
    To effectively utilize exhaust heat of an engine mounted on a vehicle. An exhaust heat utilization system includes a working fluid heating tank (11) mounted on a truck (10) driven by an engine (12) and configured to heat a working fluid (30) stored therein with exhaust heat of the engine (12) and a heater (26) configured to heat a greenhouse (25) with the working fluid (30) heated by the working fluid heating tank (11). Exhaust heat recovered from the truck (10) is utilized for the heating of the greenhouse (25).
