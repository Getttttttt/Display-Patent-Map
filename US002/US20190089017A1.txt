abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a battery module that includes a housing having a first opening configured to receive one or more battery cells and an electrical component, a housing cover configured to be disposed over the first opening to enclose the one or more battery cells and the electrical component in the housing, a signal connector disposed within the housing and electrically coupled to the electrical component, where the signal connector is configured to be actuated from a first position to a second position, and a vent port in alignment with the signal connector such that the signal connector is accessible to a push device passing through the vent port to facilitate directing the signal connector into the second position and toward a second opening of the housing cover when the housing cover is disposed over the first opening.
