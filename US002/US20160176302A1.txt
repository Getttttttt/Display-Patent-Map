abstract
    A wireless vehicle battery charging system includes an off-vehicle transducer connected to a power source and configured to wirelessly transmit and receive a first alternating current having a first frequency, an on-vehicle transducer configured to wirelessly transmit and receive the first alternating current, and a frequency converting circuit connected to the on-vehicle transducer. The frequency converting circuit is configured to change the first frequency of the first alternating current to a second alternating current having a second frequency. The system further includes a battery within the vehicle and a regenerative braking circuit connected to the frequency converting circuit and the battery. The regenerative braking circuit is configured to rectify the second alternating current to a direct current supplied to the battery and configured to convert the direct current from the battery to the second alternating current supplied to the frequency converting circuit.
