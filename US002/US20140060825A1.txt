abstract
    Methods and systems generate steam and carbon dioxide mixtures suitable for injection to assist in recovering hydrocarbons from oil sands based on concentration of the carbon dioxide in the mixtures as influenced by temperature of water introduced into a direct steam generator. Increasing temperature of the water to above 200Â° C. before introduction into the direct steam generator may utilize heat from an electrical power generation unit. Enthalpy of this preheated water impacts amount of fuel needed to burn in the direct steam generator and hence the concentration of the carbon dioxide, which may be below 11% by mass percent of the steam.
