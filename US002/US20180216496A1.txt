abstract
    A system includes a turbine system that contains a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) having a flow path that receives an exhaust gas, and having a fluid path that receives a fluid. The fluid path is adjacent to the flow path such that the fluid is heated by the exhaust gas. The HRSG includes an electrical heater that provides heat to the fluid path during a start-up mode of the HRSG, during a shutdown mode of the HRSG, or both.
