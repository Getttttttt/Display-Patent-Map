abstract
    Exemplary illustrations of a method are disclosed, including determining a baseline gradient and an increased gradient for a brake application force for a vehicle. Exemplary methods may further include actuating the baseline gradient in response to a first braking event for the vehicle, and actuating the increased gradient in response to a second braking event for the vehicle. Exemplary illustrations of a vehicle may include a braking system configured to apply braking force to at least one wheel of the vehicle, and a controller. The controller may be configured to determine a baseline gradient and an increased gradient for a brake application force for a vehicle. The controller may be configured to actuate the baseline gradient in response to a first braking event for the vehicle, and actuate the increased gradient in response to a second braking event for the vehicle.
