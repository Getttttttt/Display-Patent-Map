abstract
    A system includes a gas compressor system and a thermal cycle. The gas compressor system includes a compressor housing defining an interior compressor chamber. A gas compressor is in the interior compressor chamber to compress gas received into interior compressor chamber. A heat exchange fluid passage is provided adjacent to a surface that contacts the gas being compressed by the gas compressor. The thermal cycle includes a working fluid heated using the heat exchange fluid passage of the compressor housing. The working fluid is expanded by the thermal cycle to generate electricity.
