abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for an automatic, electric hub lock with a manual override capability. In one example, the electric hub lock may be actuated responsive to one or more of a manipulation of a manual dial proximate a vehicle wheel and an electronic control inside a passenger compartment. In another example, a method includes overriding the automatic control of the hub lock responsive to manual request for operating the vehicle in four-wheel drive mode.
