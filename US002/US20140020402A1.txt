abstract
    In one embodiment, a turbine using CO2 includes moving blades, stator blades, a working fluid transport flow path, a coolant transport flow path, and a coolant recovery flow path. The stator blades constitute turbine stages together with the moving blades. The working fluid transport flow path is configured to transport the working fluid sequentially to the turbine stages. The coolant transport flow path is configured to transport the coolant by allowing the coolant to sequentially pass through the inside of the stator blades from an upstream to a downstream of the working fluid. The coolant recovery flow path is configured to recover the coolant passing through the inside of the stator blade at a predetermined turbine stage and merge the recovered coolant with the working fluid transport flow path at a turbine stage on an upstream side of the predetermined turbine stage.
