abstract
    A vehicle includes a highly aerodynamic body for two passengers side by side with two non-steering front wheels spaced apart across the body and covered by exterior panes and a single rear steering ground wheel The bottom panel is planar and the rear wheel is carried in a disk in the plane which rotates to steer with a self centering cam. A hybrid drive system includes batteries and ultra-capacitors charged by regeneration operated by a separate foot pedal. The body includes a full width door that hinges at the front 45 and opens to near vertical to allow the passengers to step over the frame onto the floor in front of the seat with the steering wheel and pedals moved away. Wiring is contained in flat compartments in the interior walls. The batteries are contained in a temperature controlled container located at the front which also acts as a crush zone.
