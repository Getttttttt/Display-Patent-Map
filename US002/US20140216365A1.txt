abstract
    A system includes a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) including a plurality of evaporator sections. At least one evaporator section includes a natural circulation evaporator configured to generate a saturated steam, a once-through evaporator configured to generate a first superheated steam, a first superheater configured to receive the saturated steam from the natural circulation evaporator, and a second superheater configured to receive the first superheated steam from the once-through evaporator.
