abstract
    A system and method optimizes energy consumption in a railway system including a set of trains, a set of energy storage devices, and a set of substations connected to a grid by first optimizing control parameters controlling at least part of the energy consumption of the railway system to produce optimized control parameters. The optimized control parameters minimize, over multiple time steps, a combination of total power provided by the grid to satisfy a power demand of the railway system, a state-of-charge of each energy storage device, power supplied to charge the energy storage device and power supplied by the energy storage device. The optimizing is subject to constraints on operations of the railway system over multiple time steps. The constraints include a complementarity constraint. A command is generated to control the energy consumption of the railway system based on the optimized control parameters.
