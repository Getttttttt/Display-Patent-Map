abstract
    An actuator includes a slider intended to actuate a gate, movable between first and second positions, and an urging member to apply an urging force to drive the slider towards a first position when a temperature of the urging member is greater than a predetermined value. The actuator includes an elastic member that applies on the slider a return force towards a second position. The return force is less than the urging force. The urging member is a helical member with shape memory, and is ductile when its temperature is less than the predetermined value, and is formed towards a predefined helical shape when its temperature is greater than the predetermined value.
