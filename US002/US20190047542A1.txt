abstract
    An Electric Tag Axle has a differential connected to two axle shafts. A two speed gearbox is connected to the differential by way of a ring and pinion gear. A longitudinally arranged electric motor/generator is connected to the two speed gearbox. A single wheel disconnect mechanism within the axle allows for neutral operation by allowing the differential to freewheel. A vehicle energy management system is connected to the Electric Tag Axle and to a traction battery pack, and is configured to operate the Electric Tag Axle in a low range motoring mode, a high range motoring mode, a regenerative braking mode, and in the neutral mode. This allows the Electric Tag Axle are able to efficiently make use of a limited amount of stored electrical energy during vehicle takeoff, while efficiently supplementing propulsion power during motoring at cruise speeds, and while efficiently recapturing kinetic energy during regenerative braking.
