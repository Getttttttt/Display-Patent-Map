abstract
    A braking system includes a brake pressure provision device for providing brake pressure using a brake medium; a brake pressure compensation device; a wheel brake circuit including a wheel brake cylinder for braking a wheel, the wheel brake circuit being connected via a first actuator to the brake pressure provision device and via a second actuator to the brake pressure compensation device; and a control unit for controlling the actuators and the brake compensation device in such a way that the volume of the brake medium is adapted to a desirable brake pressure in the wheel brake circuit as a function of a predefined parameter, the brake pressure in the wheel brake circuit being reduced with the aid of the brake pressure compensation device and by opening the second actuator and closing the first actuator.
