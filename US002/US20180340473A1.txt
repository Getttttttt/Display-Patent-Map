abstract
    A 2×1 multi-shaft power island system is provided. The system includes a first gas turbine (GT)/gas turbine generator (GTG)/heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) island, the GT/GTG/HRSG island. The GT/GTG/HRSG island includes a first gas turbine system configured to produce power by combusting a fuel, and a first turbine generator system mechanically coupled to the first gas turbine system and configured to produce electrical power. The GT/GTG/HRSG island additionally includes a first HRSG system fluidly coupled to the first gas turbine system and configured to generate a first steam. The system further includes a second GT/GTG/HRSG island. The second GT/GTG/HRSG island includes a second gas turbine system configured to produce power by combusting the fuel, and a second turbine generator system mechanically coupled to the second gas turbine system and configured to produce electrical power.
