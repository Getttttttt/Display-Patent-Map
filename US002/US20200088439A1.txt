abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system including an exhaust plenum configured to receive an exhaust air flow from a cooling load. The HVAC system also includes a condenser configured to receive an input air flow and transfer thermal energy to the input air flow. A panel is positioned directly adjacent to and between the exhaust plenum and the condenser. The panel includes a passage providing a fluid flow path directly between the exhaust plenum and the condenser. The passage is configured to discharge a portion of the exhaust air flow, and the input air flow includes the portion.
