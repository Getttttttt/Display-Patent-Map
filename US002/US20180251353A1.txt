abstract
    A drawworks system for a mineral extraction system includes a drum mounted on a drum shaft and configured to support a cable. The system also includes a gearbox assembly having a gearbox housing, a gearbox supported by the gearbox housing and having a gearbox input shaft and a gearbox output shaft, wherein the gearbox input shaft is configured to be coupled to at least one motor and the gearbox output shaft is coupled to the drum shaft to drive rotation of the drum shaft and the drum, and a brake supported by the gearbox housing and coupled to the drum shaft to block rotation of the drum shaft and the drum, wherein the gearbox and the brake are positioned on one side of the drum along an axial axis of the drawworks system.
