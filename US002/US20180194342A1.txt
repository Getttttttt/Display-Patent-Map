abstract
    A hybrid vehicle includes an engine, an electric machine, a transmission, and a controller. The transmission is configured to alter clutch pressures in preparation for an upcoming shift between discrete gear ratios (e.g., input-to-output ratio). For example, the clutch pressures may spike to a heightened magnitude to prepare for the upcoming shift. The electric machine is configured to selectively propel the vehicle and perform regenerative braking. If regenerative braking demands occur during the clutch pressures being heightened during shift preparation, the controller is programmed to stop the preparing of the clutches. This can be done by reducing the clutch pressures back to their pre-preparation magnitude. The upcoming shift can be cancelled or delayed.
