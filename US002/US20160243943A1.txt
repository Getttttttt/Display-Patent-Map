abstract
    The antilock brake control device is used in a vehicle including: a motor to drive a wheel; a wheel bearing to transmit a rotation of the motor to the wheel and to rotationally support the wheel; and a friction brake to urge a press member against a brake rotor provided in each wheel, to generate a frictional force to brake the wheel. The antilock brake control device includes slip ratio monitor to monitor a slip ratio of the wheel; and driving torque addition section to add a torque in a driving direction to a torque command value for the motor when the slip ratio monitored by the slip ratio monitor exceeds a target slip ratio. When the torque in the driving direction is added to the torque command value for the motor, the friction brake is not operated.
