abstract
    A vehicle thermal management system including an engine, a vehicle cabin, a transmission thermal loop, and a controller is provided. The transmission thermal loop may include a transmission assembly in operational communication with the engine and a cabin thermal loop. The controller may be programmed to, responsive to detection of an engine off condition, output to a shut-off valve an open command such that heat from the transmission thermal loop transfers to the cabin thermal loop to warm the vehicle cabin. The controller may be further programmed to, responsive to detection of a cabin heater core having a temperature above a predetermined threshold, output a command to a coolant heater of an engine thermal loop to direct warm or cold fluid to the transmission assembly based on a detected transmission thermal loop temperature.
