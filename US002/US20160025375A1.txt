abstract
    A water heater of a latent heat recovery type adapted to an exhaust suction system includes a drainage water discharge path. The drainage water discharge path includes a drainage water tank having a water-seal mechanism, and the drainage water tank has a first chamber and a second chamber communicating with the first chamber through a hole. The second chamber is capable of storing drainage water up to a storage water plane located at a position higher than an upper end of the hole, and the first chamber senses a fluid level in the first chamber reaching a prescribed sensing plane. A height difference between the sensing plane in the first chamber and the storage water plane is greater than a height of a water head obtained by converting a difference between atmospheric pressure and a minimum pressure at the drainage water inlet to the water head.
