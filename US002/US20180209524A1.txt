abstract
    A series hydrostatic transmission for a vehicle having a wheel where the transmission comprises a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor each having a pumping mode and motoring mode. The pump and motor each have cylinders of cyclically varying working volume in which hydraulic fluid displacement through each cylinder is regulated and in phased relationship to cycles of cylinder working volume with reference to a phase signal. The transmission has a first mode in which the pump and motor are fluidly connected to each other, a second mode in which energy from hydraulic fluid pressurised by the motor in the pumping mode is transferred to an energy store, and a third mode in which energy from the energy store drives the motor, and wherein the motor comprises a valve assembly disposed between a high pressure line and a working chamber of the motor.
