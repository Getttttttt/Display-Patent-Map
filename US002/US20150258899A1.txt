abstract
    A vehicle such as a large truck may generate electricity for operating a hybrid engine or recharging batteries by use of an electricity generating driveshaft. The electricity generating driveshaft is comprised of a magnetized driveshaft which acts as a rotor, and a series of copper wire coils surrounding the magnetized driveshaft which acts as a stator in an electrical generator. As the magnetized driveshaft spins as a result of power from the hybrid engine, an electrical field is created which is captured by the copper wire coils and used to power the hybrid engine or recharge a supercapacitor. A truck may also be slowed by selectively activating magnets surrounding the driveshaft which slows the driveshaft rotation and thereby slows the speed of the truck to bring the truck to a stop while the driveshaft continues to generate electricity.
