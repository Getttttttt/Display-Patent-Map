abstract
    A system and method of generating steam from a emulsion stream produced from a reservoir via thermal recovery. The system includes a heat exchanger for adjusting the emulsion to a first temperature; at least one separation device for separating water from the emulsion at the first temperature to obtain produced water; and a high pressure evaporator for receiving the produced water at the first temperature and generating steam using the produced water. Also, an evaporator includes a vapor drum; a heating element in fluid communication with the vapor drum, said heating element receiving the water stream; a heating source for vaporizing the water stream for generating steam; and a bubble generator for generating bubbles and injecting generated bubbles into the heating element.
