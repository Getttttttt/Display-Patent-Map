abstract
    The present application provides a temperature control device for fluids, which comprises a furnace, a fluid pipe, a plurality of regenerative members, a burner, and an air control device. The burner heats the furnace to store heat to the regenerative members inside the furnace and conduct the thermal energy to the fluid pipe. The fluid pipi outputs a heated liquid. In addition, the regenerative members further produce and transport heated air to the air control device. The air control device converts the heated air to output cooled air.
