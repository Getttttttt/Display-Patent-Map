abstract
    The various embodiments herein provide an improved biomass based down draft gasifier for producing electrical energy. The gasifier comprises a reactor with double walled construction having an annular space between outer and inner shells. The annular space houses multiple helical guide vanes welded to the inner shell. The reactor is covered with a top cover assembly. An air inlet manifold is provided for directing the controlled air into the reactor through the air inlet nozzles. An automatic start system is provided for controlling the combustion of inlet fuel done with a spark plug. The gasifier comprises a throat which permits the ashes and charcoal of burnt fuel to drop into the bottom of the reactor. The gas separation holes are provided at the bottom of the reactor to separate the product gas from the charcoal. The product gas is taken out from an output pipe.
