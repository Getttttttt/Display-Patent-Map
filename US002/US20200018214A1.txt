abstract
    A vehicle system includes a vehicle component, a battery, and a thermoelectric module coupled to the component to allow heat transfer between the catalytic converter and the thermoelectric module, wherein the thermoelectric module is electrically connected to the battery. The vehicle system further includes a temperature sensor coupled to the vehicle component. The temperature sensor is configured to measure the temperature of the vehicle component. The vehicle system further includes a controller in electronic communication with the thermoelectric module. The controller is programmed to switch the thermoelectric module among the heating mode, the cooling mode, and the power-generation mode based on the temperature of the vehicle component. The vehicle component may be an exhaust manifold, a turbocharger turbine housing, an exhaust gas conduit coupled between an exhaust manifold and a catalytic converter, and/or a catalytic converter.
