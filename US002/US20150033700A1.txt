abstract
    Systems and methods for defrosting sensing components in fluid sensing system. In one embodiment, the invention provides a defrosting system that includes a sensing system. The sensing system includes a sensor operable to sense a characteristic of the fluid in a tank. The defrosting system includes a fluid pickup line spaced apart from the sensor, and a fluid return line. The fluid return line includes an output. The output is positioned to direct fluid onto the sensing system. In one embodiment, the defrosting system further comprises a pipe configured to provide the fluid to a system external to the tank. The fluid is heated by heat generated by the external system and directed onto the sensing system at least partially defrosts fluid contained within the sensing system.
