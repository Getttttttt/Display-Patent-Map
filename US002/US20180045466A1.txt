abstract
    A gas exhausting system includes at least two gas exhausting modules. The at least two gas exhausting modules are disposed on a heating furnace, and arranged at a front position and a rear position separately along a transporting direction of the heating furnace. Each gas exhausting module has a casing and an exhausting channel. The exhausting channel is arranged in the casing, and has an opening end. The opening end of the exhausting channel is lower than the second end of the casing. The exhausting channel is connected to a blowing machine. When the blowing machine is driven, gas is propelled into the exhausting channel, and hyperbaric gas can be exhausted upward from the opening end of the exhausting channel. The gas with higher flow velocity can provide a siphonic action, so as to accelerate gas to be exhausted from the heating furnace.
