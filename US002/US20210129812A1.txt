abstract
    A vehicle brake system installed on a vehicle equipped with an electric motor that applies a drive force to a wheel, including: a brake device configured to apply a braking force to the wheel; and a brake controller configured to control the braking force, wherein the brake controller is configured to execute a swinging-back reducing control for reducing swinging-back of a body of the vehicle on stopping by weakening the braking force immediately before the vehicle stops, based on a motor-rotation-speed-dependent running speed that is a running speed of the vehicle detected in dependence on a rotation speed of the electric motor.
