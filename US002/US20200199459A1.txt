abstract
    A furnace having a convection section with convection tubes in a convection compartment is disclosed. The convection tubes receive and preheat hydrocarbon feed primarily by convection of heat from hot flue gas that flows into in the convection section. The convection section additionally includes a perforated distributor plate that prevents flow channeling of the hot flue gas as it flows into the convection section. The furnace also includes a radiant section having radiant tubes in a radiant compartment. The radiant tubes are in fluid communication with the convection tubes so that preheated hydrocarbon feed flows from the convection section to the radiant section. The radiant section burns fuel and heats the preheated hydrocarbon feed primarily by radiation and from the hot flue gas, which flows from the radiant section into the convection section.
