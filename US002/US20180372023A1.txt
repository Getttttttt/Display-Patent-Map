abstract
    A vehicle has a waste heat recovery (WHR) system and an engine. The WHR system includes a WHR working fluid circuit with a pump, a power turbine, and a condenser. An engine coolant circuit circulates coolant between the engine and an engine coolant heat exchanger/working fluid boiler in the WHR working fluid circuit. At least one exhaust gas heat exchanger/superheater in the WHR working fluid circuit receives waste heat from an exhaust circuit and/or from an exhaust gas recirculation circuit. A working fluid cooled charge air cooler in the WHR working fluid circuit receives waste heat from compressed charge air in a charge air intake circuit. A recuperator may transfer waste heat from working fluid passing from the power turbine to the condenser to working fluid passing from the working fluid cooled charge air cooler to the engine coolant heat exchanger/working fluid boiler.
