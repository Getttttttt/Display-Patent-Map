abstract
    An electric car draws lots of power that needs to be on board the moving vehicle. An adaptive power supply can combine a variety of sources of electrical energy—which may include an internal combustion engine—and use those different sources to efficiently produce the electrical power required. An adaptive power supply provides optimal performance by sensing changing conditions, often hundreds of times per second, and then adapting itself to those conditions in order to optimize efficiency at each particular instant during a car's operation. Those conditions may include changes in user inputs, machine operating conditions, and machine operating parameters. Having multiple sources of electrical power allows effective control of more independent power parameters, enabling greater freedom to adapt to optimize efficiency. That gives adaptive power supplies that are cheaper, smaller, lighter, more powerful, and more efficient than conventional designs.
