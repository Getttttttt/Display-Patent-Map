abstract
    An energy recovery ventilator for a heating or cooling system includes a housing and a heat exchanger located in the housing for recovery of thermal energy from a stale airflow of the heating or cooling system. An exhaust fan positioned in the housing is in flow communication with the heat exchanger to urge the stale airflow from a return port disposed in a first side panel of the housing, across the heat exchanger and toward an exhaust port of the energy recovery ventilator. The exhaust fan and the heat exchanger are configured such that the heat exchanger is removable from the housing via a front panel opening in the housing without disturbing a position of the exhaust fan.
