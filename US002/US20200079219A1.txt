abstract
    In a hybrid vehicle, brake force is divided between friction brakes and regenerative braking. When the friction brakes are wet, the delivered braking force may exceed the commanded braking force resulting in a poor transition from regenerative braking to friction braking. When wet friction brakes are detected, a controller allocates more of the total braking energy to friction brakes until a threshold quantity of energy has been dissipated in the friction brakes, thus drying the friction brakes over fewer braking events than otherwise.
