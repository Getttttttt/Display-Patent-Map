abstract
    Vehicular front axle powertrain, which uses an electric motor with an external rotor is for driving and braking of the front axles of vehicles with wheels which also or only use electrical power. It consists of an electric engine (1) with an external rotor or rotor extension (1.2), which is also a generator working as a brake. The rotor or rotor extension (1.2) connects to a clutch (3), which guards against overload and may have a disc brake (3. I) mounted, which carries excess braking force. The clutch (3) connects to an internal joint (4), which connects to a shaft (5), which has an external homokinetic joint (6) with a hub shaft (6.2) for the vehicle's wheel. Rotational energy goes from the electric motor (I) without mechanical losses to the hub shaft (6.2) and back, while the hub shaft (6.2) can move relative to the stator in the (SA) and (SB) directions.
