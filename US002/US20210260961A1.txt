abstract
    A method of warming a valve assembly includes receiving an exhaust flow through a first heat exchanger first inlet; heating a coolant received through a first heat exchanger second inlet with the exhaust flow; exhausting the exhaust flow through a first heat exchanger first outlet; and discharging heated coolant through a first heat exchanger second outlet towards a second heat exchanger assembly that is coupled to the valve assembly to heat the valve assembly.
