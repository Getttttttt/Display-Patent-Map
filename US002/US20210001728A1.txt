abstract
    A system and method for setting a regenerative braking value are disclosed. The disclosed system may include: a first measurement unit configured to measure the displacement information of a brake pedal of an electric vehicle; a second measurement unit configured to measure the speed of the electric vehicle; a third measurement unit configured to measure the distance from the electric vehicle to an object in front of the electric vehicle; a first computation unit configured to compute the brake force required for a deceleration of the electric vehicle by inputting the displacement information and the speed into a first fuzzy logic algorithm; and a second computation unit configured to compute the regenerative braking value by applying the brake force and the distance to the object to a second fuzzy logic algorithm.
