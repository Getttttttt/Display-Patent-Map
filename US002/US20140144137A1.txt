abstract
    The invention in the preferred embodiment represents a method of powering any application requiring a motive body of steam in order to produce power, using stoichiometric oxyhydrogen combustion to vaporize a requisite flow of water. The steam-generation process produces water as the sole product of combustion. Applications include providing motive steam for thermal power generation systems within the electric power industry, electric-power generation systems within the railroad locomotive industry, and turbine-driven propulsion systems both water- and aeronautical-based.
