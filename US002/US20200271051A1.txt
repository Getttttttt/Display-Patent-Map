abstract
    Disclosed is a Zero Emission Onboard Charging System that charges an electric vehicle primary and secondary battery when the vehicle is being driven in full operation or at rest. The Zero Emission Onboard Charging System includes a belt driven generator configured to be installed in the vehicle, a pulley configured to the wheel to attach with a belt to the generator, a charging port configured to receive a charge from the generator, and a charge input configured to receive the charge from the charging port and to supply the charge to a primary battery and or secondary battery that powers an engine of the vehicle. Multiple belt driven generators, pulleys, inverters and batteries can be installed in configuring versions of the Zero Emission Onboard to Charging System enabling vehicles to have unlimited driving range through perpetual onboard charging capability independent of the power grid with no fuel required generating power using forward motion of the spinning wheels of the vehicle. Presently electric vehicles have zero emissions when driving, however, when they charge from the power grid emissions are transferred from the vehicle to the power plant. The Zero Emission Onboard Charging System eliminates emissions from the vehicle and ends reliance on power grid that cause emissions and pollution to generate power needed to charge EV charging stations.
