abstract
    An electric power transmission device includes an electric power transmission portion, a first communication portion, and a first control device controlling the electric power transmission portion and the first communication portion. A vehicle includes an electric power reception portion, a second communication portion, and a second control device controlling the electric power reception portion and the second communication portion. The first control device and the second control device determine whether or not to cause the electric power transmission portion to transmit electric power based on an instruction from a user which is provided after the user is notified of a status of electric power reception in the electric power reception portion or an estimated status of electric power reception in the electric power reception portion.
