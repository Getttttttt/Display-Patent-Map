abstract
    A high efficiency, thermodynamically interactive power system incorporating a “thermodynamic battery” operating in the cryogenic range. The “thermodynamic battery” is drawn upon to optimize the efficiency of power generation during times of peak demand and is “recharged” during periods of low demand. The system is ideally suited for (although not limited to) micropowerplants suitable for widely distributed generation of power in or associated with homes and small businesses, reducing transmission loading on the grid and capable of supplying power into the grid during peak load periods. The widely distributed power generation made practical by present inventions also enables distribution of heating and chill service locally on a much larger scale than is possible with large, centralized generation plants. A novel form of gear pump mechanism makes possible inexpensive and effective multi-stage compression and expansion of gaseous working fluid particularly suitable for incorporation into micropowerplants for distributed and localized power generation.
