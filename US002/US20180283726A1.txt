abstract
    A phase change material (PCM) module heat exchanger assembly includes a multi-section PCM container rotatingly supported about a center long axis of the multi-section PCM container, or a multi-section PCM container where one or more sections are slidingly mounted to the multi-section PCM container. Each section of a plurality of rotatably or slidingly selected PCM sections is selectably insertable into an air flow. A method of placing one of a group of two or more PCM sections into a building's heating, ventilation, or air conditioning (HVAC) ductwork and a method to harvest heating or cooling capacity for later use are also described.
