abstract
    A method for heating the interior of a motor vehicle and a heating system are described. In the method, electrical energy stored or generated in the motor vehicle or electrical energy fed from an external energy source is fed to an electrothermal transducer and is converted there to thermal energy, which is supplied to a carrier medium for the thermal energy. An electrothermal transducer is used, which is temporarily operated at a higher heating power in the heating-up phase than in the subsequent continuous operation. In this way, the motor vehicle interior is heated up significantly quicker than in the known methods.
