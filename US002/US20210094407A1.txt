abstract
    Systems, methods, and other implementations described herein relate to a hub motor for a wheel of a vehicle. In one embodiment, the hub motor includes a cylindrical rotor and a cylindrical stator coaxially spaced from the cylindrical rotor along an axle. The cylindrical rotor includes a rotor attachment to selectively couple the cylindrical rotor to the axle. The cylindrical stator is disposed between the cylindrical rotor and the wheel and includes stator attachments to selectively couple the cylindrical stator to an outer wheel surface of the wheel. The cylindrical rotor and the cylindrical stator are selectively attachable to the axle and the outer wheel surface, respectively, without removing the wheel from the vehicle.
