abstract
    A vehicle includes a torque converter bypass clutch, a wheel, a generator, and a controller. The torque converter bypass clutch is disposed between the wheel and the electric machine. The controller is programmed to, responsive to slip of the clutch exceeding a threshold during regenerative braking, energize the electric machine such that a torque being transferred from the wheel to the electric machine increases at a first rate and increase clutch pressure to decrease the slip. The controller is further programmed to, responsive to the slip decreasing to less than the threshold during the regenerative braking, adjust electric machine energization such the that torque being transferred from the wheel to the electric machine increases at a second rate that is greater than the first rate.
