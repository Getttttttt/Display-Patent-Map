abstract
    A method and an apparatus for controlling regenerative braking of a hybrid electric vehicle are provided and that adjust a regenerative braking torque by classifying as at least two or more regenerative braking modes and applying different regenerative braking slopes to each mode. The apparatus includes a motor controller that is configured to adjust a driving torque of a motor and a brake controller that is configured to adjust hydraulic pressure supplied to a brake cylinder of a wheel by calculating a braking torque. A hybrid controller is configured to adjust a regenerative braking torque by classifying as at least two or more regenerative braking modes and applying different regenerative braking slopes based on each mode.
