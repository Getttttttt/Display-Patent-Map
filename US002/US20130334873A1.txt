abstract
    A system and method that can generate and regenerate electricity from a vehicle having an 37 Electrically operable drive motor, 27 mechanical electric drive shaft, 29 mechanical electric wheel Axle and 31 mechanical electric wheels and or 33 mechanical electric vehicle attachment and or a 35 mechanical electric vehicle trailer. The vehicle could be designed to restore all, the electricity it used. By connecting the 27 mechanical electric drive shaft, 29 mechanical electric Wheel Axle and the 31 mechanical electrical wheels to the vehicle's inverter and store it in batteries. An inverter can be used to send that power to the 37 motor when needed. In some embodiments; excess Power can be output from the vehicle for utilities.
