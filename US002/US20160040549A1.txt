abstract
    A method for flexible operation of a power plant having a recovery steam generator having heat exchanger stages for generating live steam and/or reheater steam for a steam turbine from an exhaust flow of a gas turbine, wherein auxiliary firing is arranged in a flue gas channel of the recovery steam generator in the region of the heat exchanger stages. In order to regulate the live steam and/or the reheater steam, at least one injection cooling device is brought online directly upon using the auxiliary firing.
