abstract
    A power unit for power generation or transportation. The power unit comprises a barrel cam defining first and second planes and a substantially cylindrical body between the first and second planes. Combustion pistons coupled to the barrel cam and longitudinally disposed relative to the barrel cam so that the combustion pistons longitudinally traverse through the first plane during actuation. First Stirling pistons coupled to the barrel cam and longitudinally disposed relative to the barrel cam so that the first Stirling pistons longitudinally traverse through the first plane during actuation. Second Stirling pistons coupled to the barrel cam and longitudinally disposed relative to the barrel cam so that the second Stirling pistons longitudinally traverse through the second plane during actuation, where at least one of the pistons is coupled to the barrel cam so that the barrel cam rotates during actuation of the pistons.
