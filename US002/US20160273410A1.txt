abstract
    A thermal power plant with a generator, includes a cooling system for the generator, wherein the waste heat released from the generator on cooling can be used profitably for operating the thermal power plant, including drying fuel, in particular for drying coal. In a method for using waste heat of a generator of a thermal power plant, the waste heat of the generator is used for drying fuel, in particular for drying coal.
