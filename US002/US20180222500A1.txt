abstract
    The present invention concerns a method and system for reducing the electric power consumption of a railway system comprising at least one catenary, trains and at least one substation connected to sections of catenary and providing electric power to the catenary, wherein during the braking of the trains, the braking trains provide electric power to the catenary. The substation is associated to one device for reducing the electric power consumption and the invention:
