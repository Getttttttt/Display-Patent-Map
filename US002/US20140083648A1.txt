abstract
    A Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) includes a heater configured to be disposed within a supply air flow path, at least one pre-heater configured to be upstream from the heat exchanger within one or both of the supply and exhaust air flow paths, and a heat transfer device operatively connected to the heater and the pre-heater. The heat transfer device is configured to receive flue gas from the heater and transfer heat from the flue gas to liquid within the heat transfer device. The liquid is configured to be channeled to the pre-heater so that heat is transferred from the liquid to supply air within the supply air flow path.
