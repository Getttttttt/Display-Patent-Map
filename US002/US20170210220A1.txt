abstract
    A traction system for a vehicle may include a first mount, a second mount, a stator, and a rotor. The first mount defines a hollow core. The second mount is coaxially positioned with the first mount about a center axis. The stator is attached to and arranged along an outer surface of the first mount. The rotor is attached to and arranged along an inner surface of the second mount. The rotor faces the stator and rotates with respect to the stator and about the center axis.
