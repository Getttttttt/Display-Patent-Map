abstract
    A steam circuit is defined in a multi-section single shaft turbine. A hot reheat steam is input to a section of the multi-section turbine. A first flow path flows the hot reheat steam from an upstream side through the section of the multi-section turbine to a downstream side to create work. A second flow path directs a portion of the flow back toward the upstream side in the section of the multi-section turbine between an outer shell and an inner shell of the turbine. The effective shell cooling provides for increased main and reheat steam temperatures to improve performance. The system reduces the extraction steam flow required to meet the design final feedwater temperatures and allows more steam to expand through the low pressure section.
