abstract
    An electric vehicle includes first and second traveling motors, first and second rotational position sensors, and a measurement controller. The first rotational position sensor detects a rotation angle of the first traveling motor and has a first wheel-speed range in which a deviation of an original position of the first rotational position sensor is measurable. The second rotational position sensor detects a rotation angle of the second traveling motor and has a second wheel-speed range in which a deviation of an original position of the second rotational position sensor is measurable. The second wheel-speed range differs from the first wheel-speed range. The measurement controller executes, in an execution order, measurements of the deviations of the original positions of the first and second rotational position sensors while the electric vehicle is traveling, and switch the execution order on the basis of acceleration or deceleration data of the electric vehicle.
