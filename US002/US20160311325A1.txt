abstract
    A hybrid/electric vehicle power management system in which an Inertial Storage and Recovery System (INSTAR) utilizes an enhanced Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) system to reach higher vehicle efficiencies. INSTAR allows regenerative braking energy surges to be readily stored at high efficiency on the flywheel, whose energy is then converted to power for driving the motors, or charging the batteries at an efficient charging rate.
