abstract
    A braking force control apparatus includes: a prediction unit that predicts a time from a present time until a next start of the gear shift operation in the stepped automatic transmission based on a speed of the vehicle; an acquisition unit that acquires a state of a battery charged by a regenerative power generation of the regenerative generator; and a control unit that stops the regenerative power generation by the regenerative generator before the gear shift of the stepped automatic transmission is started, when it is determined, during the regenerative power generation by the regenerative generator, that the regenerative power generation by the regenerative power generator may be stopped due to the state of the battery during the gear shift operation of the stepped automatic transmission, based on a prediction result by the prediction unit and the state of the battery acquired by the acquisition unit.
