abstract
    An electric power source system includes an electric power generator, a voltage conversion device, a battery, an electrical load, and a control device. The voltage conversion device converts a direct current voltage. The battery is electrically connected to the electric power generator through the voltage conversion device. The electrical load is electrically connected to the electric power generator in a parallel relationship with the battery without passing through the voltage conversion device. The control device is configured to charge the battery through the voltage conversion device based on regenerative electric power in a regenerative state in which the regenerative electric power is generated by the electric power generator. the control device is configured to increase an electric power consumption of the electrical load further when the control device detects an event that impedes the charging in the regenerative state than when the control device does not detect the event.
