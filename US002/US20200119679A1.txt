abstract
    A system for reducing a resonant oscillation on a direct current bus is disclosed. The system includes a battery, a first capacitor connected in parallel with the battery, and an inductor connected in series with the first capacitor. The system also includes a first element connected in series with the inductor, a second element connected in parallel with the inductor and the first element, and a second capacitor connected in series with the first element. The system also includes an electric machine connected to the second capacitor. During a re-generation mode for charging the battery, a re-generation current o flows from the electric machine to the battery, passing through the first element and the inductor and bypassing the second element. Additionally, during a motor mode, a motor current flows from the battery to the electric machine, passing through the second element and bypassing the first element and the inductor.
