abstract
    An exhaust line includes a spiral heat exchanger having a first passage for a first fluid and a second passage for a second fluid. The second passage is arranged in a manner such that the second fluid circulates from an inlet firstly in at least one first circumferential segment disposed in a proximity of a first axial end and then into a plurality of second circumferential segments shifted towards a second axial end relative to the first circumferential segment. The second fluid advances axially in a counter current flow against the first fluid towards the first axial end while passing from one second circumferential segment to the next.
