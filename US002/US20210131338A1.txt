abstract
    A heating system is configured to produce heated fluid. The system includes a source of primary fluid, a diffusing structure comprising an outlet structure out of which the heated fluid flows, at least one conduit coupled to the source and the diffusing structure and configured to introduce to the diffusing structure the primary fluid, and an intake structure coupled to the diffusing structure and configured to introduce to the diffusing structure a secondary fluid accessible to the system. The heated fluid includes the primary and secondary fluids.
