abstract
    Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to dynamically and automatically adjusting a standard regenerative braking intensity. Roadway data, data from one or more sensors of the vehicle and data comprising parameter values for operating states of the vehicle regarding a roadway from a route being navigated by the vehicle are received by a processor of a control system of the vehicle. Standard regenerative braking intensity values based on a vehicle's acceleration is retrieved from memory. Adjusted regenerative braking intensity values are calculated based on at least one of the roadway data, the sensor data and the parameter values of the operating states of the vehicle and the standard regenerative braking intensity values. The adjusted regenerative braking intensity values are transmitted to the control system and an acceleration or deacceleration amount is applied to the vehicle based on the adjusted regenerative braking intensity values.
