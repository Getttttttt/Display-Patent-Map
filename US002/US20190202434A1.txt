abstract
    A vehicle control device includes an engine, and a motor that is driven by power to be supplied from a battery, the vehicle control device controlling a vehicle that uses at least one of engine output and motor output as a driving force. The vehicle control device includes a regeneration control and a downhill-acceleration control unit. The regeneration control unit causes the motor to perform regeneration on a downhill. The downhill-acceleration control unit performs downhill acceleration control for causing, in a specific zone on the downhill, the vehicle to travel at increased speed without allowing the vehicle to use the engine output as drive output, and without causing the motor to perform the regeneration.
