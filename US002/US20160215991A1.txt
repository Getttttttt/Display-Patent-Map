abstract
    A humidifier assembly for capturing moisture from the furnace and releasing the moisture into an area includes a furnace. A housing is coupled to the furnace. An inlet is coupled to the housing. The inlet is coupled to a drain line on the furnace. Condensation from the furnace is directed into the housing. A filter is removably coupled to the housing. The filter captures the condensation from the furnace and converts the condensation into an evaporate. The evaporate is released into the furnace. An outlet is coupled to the housing. An overflow line is coupled to the outlet. Excess condensation is directed outwardly from the housing. A reservoir is coupled to the overflow line. The reservoir captures the excess condensation.
