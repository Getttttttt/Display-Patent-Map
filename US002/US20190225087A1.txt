abstract
    A method is indicated for operating a motor vehicle, as well as a motor vehicle, having an electric machine for the positive or negative acceleration of the motor vehicle as well as a mechanical brake device for reducing the vehicle speed of the motor vehicle. In a special brake operation mode, a deceleration demand (V) is detected, and a target rotational speed curve (nsoll) of the electric machine is determined in dependence on the deceleration demand (V). An actual rotational speed (nist) of the electric machine for reducing the vehicle speed of the motor vehicle is then adapted to the target rotational speed curve (nsoll) so determined.
