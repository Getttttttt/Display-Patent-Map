abstract
    The invention relates to a waste-heat utilisation assembly (1) of an internal combustion engine (50), comprising a working circuit (2) that conducts a working fluid. In said working circuit (2) are arranged, in the direction of flow of the working fluid, a feed pump (6), an evaporator (10), an expansion machine (3) and a condenser (4). The evaporator (10) is also arranged in an exhaust tract (53) of said internal combustion engine (50). Between the evaporator (10) and the condenser (4), an auxiliary line (2 b) is connected in parallel to the working circuit (2). According to the invention, a sub-stream evaporator (12) is arranged in the auxiliary line (2 b) and a pressure sensor (14) and/or a temperature sensor (13) are also arranged in said auxiliary line (2 b), said pressure sensor (14) and/or temperature sensor (13) being arranged downstream of the sub-stream evaporator (12).
