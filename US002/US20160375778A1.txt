abstract
    A power net system of a fuel cell vehicle is provided. The power net system includes a fuel cell and a first switching unit that is configured to form and block an electrical connection between an output terminal of the fuel cell and a main bus. A load device diverges and is connected between the output terminal and the first switching unit. A reverse current blocking unit is disposed between the output terminal of the fuel cell and a node from which the load device diverges and is configured to block a current flow to the output terminal of the fuel cell. A second switching unit is configured to form and block an electrical connection between the output terminal of the fuel cell and the load device. A controller operates the first and second switching units to form the electrical connection between the main bus and the load device.
