abstract
    Aspects of the present disclosure generally pertains to freight trailers having onboard power. Aspects of the present disclosure more specifically are directed toward an electric freight trailer that can recycle the trailer braking energy of the towing vehicle, and also provide additional thrust to propel the freight trailer. Aspects of the present disclosure are also directed toward an electric freight trailer that can propel itself independently of a tractor, including steering and braking. Aspects of the disclosure are also directed toward additional subsystems that can utilize the trailer energy source.
