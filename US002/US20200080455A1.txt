abstract
    A wireless power transfer system for a train that includes one or more locomotive units with an energy storage system and one or more passenger cars units that transmit power to the one or more locomotive units. The wireless power transfer system includes one or more HEP cables through which power is provided from the one or more passenger car units to the one or more locomotive units, one or more wireless power transfer (WPT) transmitters mounted to the rail separate from the train, a WPT receiver on one of the one or more passenger cars configured to receive power from one of the one or more WPT transmitters, and an inverter on the one of the one or more passenger car units connected to the HEP cables. The inverter receives power from the WPT receiver and sends the power to the energy storage system through the HEP cables.
