abstract
    Provided are a motor driving apparatus and a clothing treatment apparatus including the same. The motor driving apparatus includes an inverter unit including a plurality of upper switches and a plurality of lower switches and configured to output AC power to a motor by a switching operation and a processor configured to control the inverter unit to perform power generation braking by maintaining the plurality of upper switches in a full off state and maintain the plurality of lower switches in a full on state. The processor performs a current control step of complementarily switching phase currents flowing into the plurality of upper switches and the plurality of lower switches prior to the power generation braking.
