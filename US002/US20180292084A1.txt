abstract
    A method of evaporation comprises cooling a prime mover using a coolant. The cooling comprising pumping the coolant from the prime mover through a heat exchanger and back to the prime mover in a cooling circuit. A process fluid is circulated in an evaporator loop comprising the heat exchanger and a flash tank, the process fluid being circulated from the flash tank, through the heat exchanger and to a flash nozzle positioned in the flash tank. A pressure of the process fluid is reduced across the flash nozzle from a first pressure upstream of the flash nozzle to a second pressure in the flash tank, wherein heat from the coolant provides sufficient thermal energy to the process fluid in the heat exchanger so that a percentage of the process fluid changes phase from liquid to steam when the pressure of the process fluid is reduced across the flash nozzle. Steam is ejected from the flash tank to separate the steam from the process fluid.
