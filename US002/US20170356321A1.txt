abstract
    A system includes an exhaust passage and a waste heat recovery system. The exhaust passage is structured to fluidly couple to an exhaust manifold of an engine, and to receive exhaust gas from the engine. The waste heat recovery system includes a working fluid circuit, a superheater, and an expander. The working fluid circuit includes a pump to circulate a working fluid through the working fluid circuit, including through the engine. Heat is transferred from the engine to the working fluid. The superheater is positioned along the working fluid circuit downstream of the engine. The superheater is fluidly coupled to the exhaust passage and transfers heat from the exhaust gas to the working fluid. The expander is positioned along the working fluid circuit downstream of the superheater. The expander generates useful energy from the heat transferred to the working fluid from the exhaust gas and the engine.
