abstract
    A kit for retrofitting a golf cart having wheels driven by an electric motor. The kit includes a replacement motor controller for operating the electric motor. The replacement motor controller includes memory for storing motor operation limits corresponding to the golf cart. A driving parameter programmer is in communication with the replacement motor controller for selecting one or more driving parameters including: acceleration limit; speed limit; regenerative braking limit; and vehicle range. The replacement motor controller adjusts a motor control profile in real-time based on selection of the driving parameter, and the replacement motor controller maintains the motor control profile within the motor operation limits stored in the memory.
