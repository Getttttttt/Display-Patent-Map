abstract
    A waste heat recovery system for use with a cooling system of an internal combustion engine is provided. The waste heat recovery system comprises a condenser, a pump, a fluid reservoir, a heat exchanger, an expansion device, and an auxiliary cooling device. The condenser is in thermal communication with the cooling system of the internal combustion engine. The heat exchanger is in fluid communication with the pump and thermal communication with an exhaust of the internal combustion engine. The expansion device is in fluid communication with the heat exchanger and the condenser. The auxiliary cooling device is in fluid communication with at least one of the condenser, the expansion device, and the fluid reservoir. In response to an effectiveness of the condenser in dissipating heat from the waste heat recovery system to the cooling system of the internal combustion engine, the auxiliary cooling device is selectively actuated.
