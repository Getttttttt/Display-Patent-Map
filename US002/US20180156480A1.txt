abstract
    A ridge vent for ventilating a roof of a building via a hole along a roof ridge to atmosphere, the ridge vent comprising a first ridge vent panel: a flange portion for resting on the roof, the flange portion having an opening for overlapping with the hole, the flange portion having a first flange portion positioned to one side of the opening and a second flange portion positioned to another side of the opening, such that the first flange portion and the second flange portion are at an acute angle with respect to one another; a frame portion coupled to the flange portion and having sides extending upwardly from the flange portion about the opening, the frame portion for maintaining a cap portion in a spaced apart relationship with the flange portion; the cap portion connected to the frame portion and covering over the opening; a first corrugated filter plate extending between the cap portion and the flange portion and positioned transversely between the opening and the atmosphere, the first corrugated filter plate positioned to said one side of the opening; and a second corrugated filter plate extending between the cap and the flange portion and positioned transversely between the opening and the atmosphere, the second corrugated filter plate positioned to said another side of the opening; wherein the corrugated filter plates providing for a passage of air between the atmosphere and the opening, the corrugated filter plates having a pore size sufficient for facilitating the air passage of air through the corrugated filter plates while blocking passage of atmospheric particles through the corrugated filter plates.
