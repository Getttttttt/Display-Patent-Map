abstract
    An electric vehicle control device includes a calculation unit that calculates a regenerative-brake-torque load factor when a braking command is detected. The calculation unit includes a brake-torque load-factor determination unit that determines the regenerative-brake-torque load factor according to vehicle speed information that is a detection value of vehicle speed; and a brake-torque load-factor correction unit that corrects the regenerative-brake-torque load factor determined by the brake-torque load-factor determination unit using element temperature information that is temperature information of a switching element included in an inverter.
