abstract
    A vehicle includes a motor; a transmission; a battery; a mode input device for receiving a driving mode; a control information input device for receiving regenerative braking control information or gearshift level control information; and a controller configured to control at least one of braking torque of the motor and gearshift level of the transmission to control an amount of regenerative braking during regenerative braking by recognizing a signal received from the control information input device as a signal corresponding to the regenerative braking control information when the driving mode input to the mode input device is a first mode, and control the transmission to control the gearshift level of the transmission by recognizing a signal received from the control information input device as a signal corresponding to the gearshift level control information when the driving mode input to the mode input device is a second mode.
