abstract
    An apparatus includes a vehicle configured to support the user. The apparatus also includes an operation-switch assembly configured to be supported by the vehicle. The operation-switch assembly is also configured to switch propulsion operation of the vehicle between a first propulsion-operation mode and a second propulsion-operation mode. In the first propulsion-operation mode, the operation-switch assembly is also configured to permit propulsion of the vehicle to be influenced by a power-train assembly being configured to generate a power-train force. In the second propulsion-operation mode, the operation-switch assembly is also being configured to: (A) permit propulsion of the vehicle to be influenced by a non power-train force, and (B) permit propulsion of the vehicle to be not influenced by the power-train force of the power-train assembly.
