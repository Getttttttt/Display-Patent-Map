abstract
    A method and apparatus for controlling the mass flow rate of a positive displacement expander comprises pumping a working fluid to a heat exchanger to convert the fluid into a working vapor. At least a portion of the working vapor is stored in an accumulator connected to the heat exchanger. At least a portion of the working vapor stored in the accumulator is selectively released into a positive displacement expander via a pulse width modulated valve to increase the efficiency of the expander.
