abstract
    A condensate trap for a furnace system includes a trap inlet configured to receive combusted gases, a condensate chamber coupled to the trap inlet and configured to trap condensate, a trap outlet coupled to the condensate chamber and configured to exhaust the combusted gases, a header box inlet configured to receive condensate from a header box, and a condensate outlet configured to drain condensate from the condensate chamber. Combusted gas that passes through the condensate trap provides heat to condensate within the condensate trap to thaw frozen condensate or to prevent condensate from freezing.
