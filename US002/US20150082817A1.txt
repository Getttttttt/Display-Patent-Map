abstract
    A low temperature cooling and dehumidification system uses a reverse airflow arrangement to defrost a frosted cooling coil while not interrupting operation. Automatic air dampers are used to reverse the airflow at the proper time to initiate defrost of that section of frosted cooling coil. This system is useful for low temperature cooling and dehumidification in situations where the inlet air is above freezing, however exiting air below freezing can be supplied if desired. It is advantageous for operation if the coolant flow and temperature internal to the cooling coil are regulated to create the conditions for frost formation to begin closer to the air leaving side of the active cooling coil. The dehumidified generated condensate can be collected and used as grey water and/or potable water.
