abstract
    Method and installation for calcining cement raw meal in a calciner whereby fuel and a calciner oxidant having an oxygen content of at least 30% vol are introduced into the calciner so as to generate either an oxidant-lean zone or a fuel-lean zone in the calciner located between the lowermost fuel inlet level and the lowermost oxidant inlet level of the calciner, between 50% and 100% by weight of the raw meal being supplied to the calciner upstream of and/or within the oxidant-lean, respectively the fuel-lean zone.
