abstract
    A system for cooling at least one electrical component of a machine. The machine is powered by a liquefied natural gas (LNG). The system includes at least one blower and at least one heat exchanger. The at least one blower is arranged to direct an air flow towards the at least one electrical component. The at least one heat exchanger is arranged upstream of the at least one electrical component. The at least one heat exchanger is using LNG as the coolant for cooling the air flow being directed towards the at least one electrical component.
