abstract
    A system for the thermal preparation of reclaimed road material containing PAHs, or of oil sludge having a loading station for pre-comminuted reclaimed road material or oil sludge, a rotary kiln in which the reclaimed road material or the oil sludge is burned, while oxidation air is fed in, a dust separator to which the flue gases produced in the rotary kiln are fed, an after-burner to which the flue gases leaving the dust separator are fed, and a filter to which the flue gases arising in the after-burning means are fed. These components are divided into a plurality of modules, each of which includes a weight and dimension such that each may individually be transported using conventional road transport means, in particular low loaders or heavy goods vehicles.
