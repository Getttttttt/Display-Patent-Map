abstract
    A heat exchanger is provided including a plurality of heat exchanger tubes. A first fluid flows through each heat exchanger tube and a second fluid flows around an exterior of each heat exchanger tube. A turbulator is disposed within at least one of the heat exchanger tubes. The turbulator extends at least a portion of the length of the heat exchanger tube. The turbulator includes a generally flat sheet of material having a plurality of integrally formed turbulence generating elements. The turbulence generating elements extend from a plane of the sheet of material into the first fluid flow. A disturbance is created in the first fluid flow adjacent each turbulence generating element.
