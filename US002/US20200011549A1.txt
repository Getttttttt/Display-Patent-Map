abstract
    An air conditioning system that includes an energy recovery ventilator that transfers energy between a supply air stream and an exhaust air stream. Downstream of the energy recovery ventilator are multiple refrigeration circuits that reject heat into both the supply air stream and the exhaust air stream. The use of the multiple refrigeration circuits eliminates the need to mount outdoor equipment and provide piping for a cooling system.
