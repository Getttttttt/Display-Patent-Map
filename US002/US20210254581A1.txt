abstract
    Various disclosed embodiments include combined heating and power modules and combined heat and power devices. In an illustrative embodiment, a combined heat and power device includes a heating system including: at least one burner; at least one igniter configured to ignite the at least one burner; a fluid motivator assembly including an electrically powered prime mover; and a heat exchanger fluidly couplable to the fluid motivator assembly. At least one alkali metal thermal-to-electricity converter (AMTEC) has a high pressure zone and a low pressure zone, the high pressure zone being thermally couplable to the at least one burner, the low pressure zone being thermally couplable to the heat exchanger.
