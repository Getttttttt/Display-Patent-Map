abstract
    In a heating heat-source apparatus having input circuits configured to receive pieces of mutually independent heating demand information, an abnormality related to an operation for setting one input circuit among the input circuits to a use state is detected and reported. Input circuits receive heating demand information. An operation part receives an operation for setting one input circuit of the input circuits to a use state. A CPU receives heating demand information transmitted from the input circuit in the use state while receiving specified information for specifying the input circuit in the use state from the operation part. Each piece of heating demand information is voltage information having a predetermined voltage range. The CPU reports an abnormality related to an operation for setting when voltage information transmitted from the input circuit in the use state deviate from a voltage range specified in the specified information.
