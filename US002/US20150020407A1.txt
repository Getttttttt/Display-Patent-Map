abstract
    In a method for reprocessing wet waste materials containing organic components, in particular sludges in a cement clinker production plant, in which raw meal is preheated in a preheater (3) in countercurrent flow to the hot exhaust gases of a clinker furnace (2), and calcined in a calciner (4) fired with alternative fuels, the wet waste materials are dried in a drying unit (18) using a hot gas produced from the preheater waste heat and the dried waste materials and the drier exhaust gases are discharged from the drying unit (18), wherein the drier exhaust gases are introduced into the calciner (4).
