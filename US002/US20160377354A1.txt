abstract
    The invention is in the form of a regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) comprising a chamber having a first opening into the chamber, a second opening into the chamber, a source of heat within the chamber, and one or more heat recovery media positioned within the chamber, each heat recovery media comprising plates having a first surface and an opposite second surface, wherein at least one plate has one or more openings passing from the first surface to the second opposite surface. The arrangement of the plates provides channels formed between adjacent plates and a flow of gas through the chamber is parallel with the channels
