abstract
    An electric vehicle braking system including a braking controller, a front braking system, and a rear braking system. The front braking system includes a front friction brake and a front regenerative braking system. The rear braking system includes a rear regenerative braking system and excludes a friction brake. The braking controller is configured to detect the front regenerative braking has reached a maximum force, detect additional deceleration is required, and, in response to detecting the front regenerative braking has reached the maximum force and detecting additional deceleration is required, apply the front friction brake.
