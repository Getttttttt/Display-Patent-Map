abstract
    A heat exchanger system has two heat exchangers, a first heat exchanger and a second heat exchanger, mounted within a single enclosure, a first air inlet for receiving air from a first air system, a first air outlet, one or more second air inlets for receiving air from a second air system, one or more second air outlets, a first air path defined as a sealed air path from the first air inlet through the first heat exchanger, to the first air outlet, and a second air path, a third air path and a fourth air path, wherein the first air path transfers heat/energy through the first heat exchanger in a counter-flow relation with the third air path, and the second air path transfer heat/energy through the second heat exchanger in a counterflow relation with the fourth air path.
