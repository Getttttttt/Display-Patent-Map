abstract
    An object of the present invention is to remove adverse effects on an in-wheel motor driving apparatus due to the existence of moisture in the apparatus. There is provided an in-wheel motor driving apparatus in which a driving apparatus for generating driving force of a wheel having a wheel hub bearing section is provided in the wheel, the in-wheel motor driving apparatus, wherein a portion of the driving apparatus, except the wheel hub bearing section, is housed in a case having a sealed structure and thereby the inside of the driving apparatus is blocked from outside air, and air in the case is replaced with inert gas as required. As a result, dew condensation is prevented in the case, and adverse effects due to the existence of moisture in the case are removed.
