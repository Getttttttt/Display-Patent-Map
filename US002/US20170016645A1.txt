abstract
    Energy-saving method/system for heating and humidifying a building or car's saloon are disclosed. The method includes—drawing in an outside airstream,—passing it via a dry channel and then, via a wet channel, in an opposite direction. Thereafter, the outside airstream is heated and directed to the building as supply air. An exhaust airstream from the building is introduced into a product channel. The wet channel is situated between the dry and product channels. The wet channel is in pairwise heat-exchange interactions with the wet and product channels. Water vapor, contained in the exhaust airstream, is condensed, discharged into the atmosphere at a temperature closed to the dew point. The outside airstream, passed along the wet channel, is transfer-heated and humidified by the exhaust airstream. Water from the product channel is used for wetting the wet channel. The system includes at least two membranes arranged between the channels.
