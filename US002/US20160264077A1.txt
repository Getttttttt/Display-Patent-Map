abstract
    A system for optimizing energy efficiency in an electrified vehicle includes an HVAC system configured to provide climate control for at least one of (i) a cabin of the electrified vehicle and (ii) a battery system of the electrified vehicle; a regenerative braking system configured to convert the electrified vehicle's kinetic energy into electrical energy; and a controller configured to, based on a vehicle torque request, control a distribution of the electrical energy generated by the regenerative braking system between (i) recharging a battery system of the electrified vehicle and (ii) powering the HVAC system. A method for controlling the HVAC system includes determining, at the controller of the electrified vehicle, the vehicle torque request, and based on the vehicle torque request, controlling, by the controller, the distribution of electrical energy generated by a regenerative braking system between (i) recharging the battery system and (ii) powering the HVAC system.
