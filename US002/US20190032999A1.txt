abstract
    A continuous industrial furnace comprising: an inlet; a heating zone; a cooling zone; and an outlet in this order, the continuous industrial furnace being configured to heat-treat a workpiece while conveying the workpiece from the inlet to the outlet, wherein at least a part of the heating zone comprises a furnace wall heat insulation structure, the furnace wall heat insulation structure comprising: an outer wall having one or more gas introducing ports; and a porous thermal insulation layer arranged with a gap on an inner side of the outer wall; and wherein the heating zone further comprises one or more exhaust ports for sucking and discharging the gas after the gas flows into the heating zone of the furnace from the gas introducing ports through the gap and the porous thermal insulation layer In this order and then flows toward the inlet side.
