abstract
    A pressure generating device may comprise a piston-cylinder unit having a bilaterally acting piston with two effective surfaces defining two respective, separate working spaces in a sealing manner. Each working space is connected via a hydraulic line to a hydraulic circuit, wherein at least one hydraulic chamber of a consumer is connected to each hydraulic circuit, and wherein a drive drives the piston. Each working space may be in communication with a reservoir for hydraulic medium, via a respective hydraulic line having a respective switching valve. Alternatively, one or both working spaces may be in communication with a reservoir for hydraulic medium via a hydraulic line, with a switching valve in one or both hydraulic lines, and/or a respective outlet valve may be associated with one or more hydraulic chambers of the consumer, and a further connecting line having a switching valve may connect the pressure chambers and/or hydraulic lines.
