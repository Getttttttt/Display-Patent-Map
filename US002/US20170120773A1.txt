abstract
    A battery system may include multiple battery cells having different chemistries. To achieve certain performance goals, voltage parameters for the battery system, such as cruising voltages and maximum voltages can be adjusted. These adjustments may, for example, direct charging currents to a lithium-ion battery to increase fuel economy or may direct charging currents away from a lithium-ion battery to increase its longevity. Methods for matching batteries having different chemistries based on their open circuit voltages are also discussed.
