abstract
    A global cooling system including a heat-exchanger-boiler, a heat-exchanger-condenser, a pump, a compressor, a rotary-device, a generator, an electrical power-inverter, and a voltage-regulator, in a preferred embodiment. The global cooling system utilizes a high-temperature-liquid, which may be water, from a water-source to heat the low-temperature-liquid, which may be a refrigerant, to produce net heat and therefore power a generator via a Rankine Cycle. The system configured to convert heat from the high-temperature-fluid to the low-temperature-fluid such that the heat is absorbed from the high-temperature-fluid into the low-temperature-fluid to convert the high-temperature-fluid such that the high-temperature-fluid is cooled to produce an electrical and/or mechanical output. Also included is a method of using a global cooling system.
