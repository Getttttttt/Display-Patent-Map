abstract
    A method and an apparatus are provided for distributing a braking force to braking units upon braking of an eco-friendly vehicle equipped with a motor. The distribution of a braking force of a vehicle includes a creep torque to calculate a total braking force and distribute the total braking force to each braking unit to provide a more uniform braking force based on a vehicle speed.
