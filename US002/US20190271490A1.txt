abstract
    Systems and methods for controlling temperature in an enclosed space can include an air-to-air heat exchanger (AAHX) and a direct evaporative cooler (DEC). The DEC can be located in a scavenger or outdoor air stream such that the DEC cools the outdoor air, which is then used to cool or reject heat from a process air stream passing through the AAHX. In an example, the AAHX can be a sensible wheel. In another example, the AAHX can be a counter-flow flat plate. The system can operate in various modes, including an economizer mode and an evaporation mode, depending, in part, on the outdoor air conditions and a load on the system. In some examples, the system can include a DX coil to provide additional cooling to the process air in another operating mode.
