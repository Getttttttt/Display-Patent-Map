abstract
    Generally a power unit including an internal combustion engine and a Stirling engine engaged through a common power transmission system to offset applied load. Specifically, a Stirling engine which uses the heat discharged by an internal combustion engine as heat source with the engine speed of the Stirling engine controlled by a combination of regulation of fuel consumption of and application of an exhaust brake to the internal combustion engine to transfer a compressive load of the internal combustion engine to the Stirling engine through the common power transmission system.
