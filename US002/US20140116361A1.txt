abstract
    Systems for the recovery of heat from hot air exhaust from industrial processes, and the utilization of recovered heat to generate steam at two discrete (high and low) pressures. The systems match steam production with demand. The systems utilize efficient finned tube exchange units made up of modular sections that can be selectively associated with either high or low pressure steam generators. The systems utilize separate steam domes for each of the discrete steam pressures. The steam dome components may be structured apart from the heat exchange components. Each steam dome utilizes its own sensor and control instrumentation to vary the allocation of heat recovered to either or both the high or low pressure steam generator. The two generator subsystems are linked to operate variably according to demand. Monitoring upstream heat and downstream steam requirements allow for automated operation and allocation of recovered heat into the two subsystems.
