abstract
    A drive system includes an engine, an alternator coupled to the engine, the alternator being configured to power at least one auxiliary load, a traction motor system operatively coupled to drive wheels of the vehicle, the traction motor system being configured for receiving primary electrical power from the alternator and for propelling the vehicle in response to the primary electrical power, and a motor electrically connected to the traction motor system and mechanically coupled to the engine. The motor is configured to receive electrical power from the traction motor system in a dynamic braking mode of operation of the traction motor system and to communicate power to the engine during the dynamic braking mode.
