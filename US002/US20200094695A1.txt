abstract
    Controlled clutchless shifting of multi-ratio geared electronic shift transmissions coupled directly to the electrical prime mover of a vehicle are disclosed. The adaptive control of electrically shifted manual transmissions incorporated into power-split series electric hybrid heavy vehicles operating over heavy duty drive cycles utilizes a direct coupling assembly that enables bi-directional energy transfer and power transport. An electronic shift transmission provides power amplifying or de-amplifying bi-directional intelligently controlled valve or pathway for available terrain potential or kinetic energy of a rolling mass of a vehicle, while retaining the original function of a transmission by increasing or decreasing mechanical rotating energy of the propulsion power to the rear wheels of a vehicle.
