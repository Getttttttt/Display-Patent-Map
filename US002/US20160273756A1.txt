abstract
    A method of operating a combined heat and power plant (10) (CHP plant) includes generating hot flue gas in a hot flue gas generator (12) and cooling the hot flue gas in a sequence of cooling steps to recover heat and to generate steam in a heat recovery steam generator (16) (HRSG). The HRSG (16) includes an HP steam evaporator (26) downstream of the hot flue gas generator (12) in which HP steam is generated and in which the hot flue gas is cooled, at least one HP steam superheater (20, 22) between the hot flue gas generator (12) and the HP steam evaporator (26) in which at least HP steam from the HP steam evaporator is superheated and in which the hot flue gas is cooled, and an MP steam superheater (24) upstream of the HP steam evaporator (26) in which MP steam is superheated by the hot flue gas and in which hot flue gas is cooled.
