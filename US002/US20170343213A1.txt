abstract
    [Problems to be Solved] An exhaust duct (4) for assembly into a combustion apparatus has: a burner (1) to eject air-fuel mixture downward; and a combustion box (3) disposed on a lower side of the burner (1). The exhaust duct includes: a riser duct section (42) elongated in a vertical direction and having, at a lower portion thereof, an inlet port (41) connected to an exhaust port (35) for combustion gas which is opened in a lower portion of the combustion box (3); and a flat horizontal duct section (43) bent at an upper end of the riser duct section (42) so as to be elongated forward. By restraining the resonance of an upper wall part (431) and a lower wall part (432) of the horizontal duct section (43), noises due to resonance sounds are reduced.
