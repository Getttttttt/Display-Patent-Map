abstract
    Several methods and systems for pre-cooling warm air in a cooling system are disclosed. The warm air may be return air, fresh air or a combination of return and fresh air. Condensate from a primary cooling element is applied to the wet side of an air-to-air heat exchanger while the warm air passes through the dry side of the heat exchanger. The warm air is pre-cooled by the transfer of heat from the warm air to the condensate, reducing overall energy consumption in the cooling system.
