abstract
    A regenerative power-amount estimation device according to an embodiment includes a regenerative power-amount estimation model for each brake notch switching configured to include a transient response of an electric brake corresponding to a switching operation of a brake notch for each switching operation of the brake notch in an operation of railway vehicles. A regenerative power-amount estimation part is configured to estimate an expected amount of regenerative power acquired for a brake plan being temporal transition data of the brake notch, based on the regenerative power-amount estimation model for each brake notch switching.
