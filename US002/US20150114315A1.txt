abstract
    A method for releasing an anhydrous gas in a gas phase at a target rate includes the step of obtaining a vessel at least partially filled with the anhydrous gas. The anhydrous gas is at least partially in a liquid phase and the vessel has an outlet for releasing the anhydrous gas in the gas phase. The method further includes releasing at least a portion of the anhydrous gas from the vessel through the outlet in the gas phase; applying a heat transfer fluid having a temperature of 32° F. to 150° F. to an exterior surface of the vessel during the releasing step, such that the anhydrous gas in the liquid phase is evaporated and the anhydrous gas in the gas phase is released at the target rate; and measuring starting and end weights of the vessel to monitor the releasing of the anhydrous gas in the gas phase.
