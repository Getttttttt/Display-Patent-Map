abstract
    A device which is configured for controlling a vehicle drive (40) for traction of a vehicle has a drive control apparatus and a monitoring apparatus. In order to ensure a high degree of safety when using the vehicle drive during rapid deceleration of the vehicle, the monitoring apparatus provides a traction release control signal value to the drive control apparatus, under the effect of which the drive control apparatus is enabled to control the vehicle drive, if, in addition to a traction release request signal value due to a rapid deceleration request and an additional traction lock request signal value due to a traction lock request, an additional traction release request signal value due to a traction release condition has effect on the monitoring apparatus. There is also described a vehicle with such a device and to a method for controlling a vehicle drive for traction of a vehicle.
