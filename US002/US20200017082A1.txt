abstract
    Provided is a vehicle braking control device applicable to a vehicle equipped with an electric-powered parking braking device, a hydraulic braking device and a regenerative braking device. The braking control device comprises a first braking control unit and a second braking control unit. When a parking braking operation is performed while the vehicle is travelling, the first braking control unit implements a first braking process which increases the braking force to the vehicle by operating the hydraulic braking device. When the braking force to the vehicle needs to be increased in a situation where the first braking process is being implemented, the second braking control unit implements a second braking process which increases the braking force to the vehicle by operating the regenerative braking device.
