abstract
    A vehicle includes a front-wheel/rear-wheel motor, a battery and an ECU. The ECU is configured to (i) control the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors, and (ii) control the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors such that a braking torque of a resonance-side motor, when at least one of the rotation speed of the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors is within a resonance range, is smaller than the braking torque of the resonance-side motor, when the rotation speed of the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors are outside the resonance range, and such that the braking torque of a non-resonance-side motor, when at least one of the rotation speed of the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors is within a resonance range, is larger than the braking torque of the non-resonance-side motor, when the rotation speed of the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors are outside the resonance range, during deceleration caused by a braking torque from the front-wheel/rear-wheel motors.
