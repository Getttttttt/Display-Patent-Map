abstract
    A heat exchange cell includes a casing, a heat exchanger in which a first heat transfer fluid flows, a feeding zone, and first and second collection chambers for a second heat transfer fluid. The casing can include rear, front, and peripheral side walls. The heat exchanger can be helically-shaped, mounted in the casing, and include at least one tubular duct for the flow of the first heat transfer fluid. The tubular duct can be coiled about a longitudinal axis and define a helix. The feeding zone of the second heat transfer fluid can be defined in the casing coaxially and internally with respect to the helix. The first chamber can be defined externally with respect to the heat exchanger by a radially outer wall thereof and the peripheral side wall. The second chamber can be at least partially delimited by at least one separating element.
