abstract
    Systems and methods for operating a transmission of a hybrid powertrain that includes a motor/generator are described. The systems and methods may classify transmission degradation in response to an estimated transmission input shaft speed that is determined from transmission output shaft speed. In one example, transmission degradation may be correctable transmission degradation, partial transmission degradation, and continuous transmission degradation.
