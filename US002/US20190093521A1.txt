abstract
    The object of the present invention is a plant and related method for the supply to the end-user, by making use of the heating power transferred by a heat source e.g. gas, oil products, coal or renewable type e.g. biomass, solar, geothermal, simultaneously with electric power and/or mechanical power, heating power and cooling power “Heating-Cooling” operating mode of the plant or simultaneously with electric power and/or mechanical power and heating power only “Heating” operating mode of the plant or simultaneously with electric power and/or mechanical power and cooling power only “Cooling” operating mode of the plant. The operation of the plant, according to each of the three operation modes, is obtained by the regulation of several on-off valves and a flow rate regulation valve.
