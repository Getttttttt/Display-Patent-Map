abstract
    Embodiments for heating a vehicle driveline are provided. One example method for a vehicle comprises heating a fluid with kinetic vehicle energy in response to a vehicle braking request, and directing the fluid to a driveline component. In this way, kinetic vehicle energy during a vehicle braking event may be used to heat a driveline component.
