abstract
    An electro-hydraulic hybrid system for a vehicle utilizes both the advantages of the hydraulic hybrid system and the electric hybrid system to maximize the collection of energy lost during a braking process and to provide launch assists in an acceleration process. The electro-hydraulic hybrid system includes an ECU that controls the electro-hydraulic hybrid system, a hydraulic drive pump, an accumulator, a hydraulic reservoir, a hydraulic pump, an electric motor, a power converter, and a battery. The hydraulic reservoir is in fluid communication with the accumulator through the hydraulic drive pump that functions as the main component of the hydraulic regenerative braking system. The hydraulic reservoir is also in fluid communication with the accumulator through the hydraulic pump that acts as the main component of the electro-hydraulic inter-conversion unit along with the electric motor, the at least one battery, and power converter that are electrically connected to each other.
