abstract
    An apparatus for treating a combustion product stream includes a burner assembly configured to support one or more flames, the burner assembly having at least a portion configured to be driven to or held at one or more first voltages. A collection surface is held at a voltage different than the one or more first voltages to attract particulates charged by the burner assembly.
