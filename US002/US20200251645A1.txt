abstract
    The thermoelectric conversion device includes thermoelectric conversion elements disposed in a row in a first direction and a second direction that intersect each other in a plane on a first surface side of a base material, hot junction portions thermally connected to ends on hot junction sides of the thermoelectric conversion elements, and cold junction portions thermally connected to ends on cold junction sides of the thermoelectric conversion elements. The hot junction portions and the cold junction portions are alternately disposed in a row in the first direction and the second direction. The base material has thin portions provided corresponding to junction portions that are either the hot junction portions or the cold junction portions and thick portions provided corresponding to the other junction portions. The thick portions that are adjacent in a third direction different from the first and second directions are connected.
