abstract
    An ESS charging and discharging operation method may include the steps of: checking whether SOC of the ESS is within an operable range, and performing an SOC management operation if the SOC of the ESS is not within the operable range; performing, if the SOC of the ESS is within the operable range, a catenary wire voltage control operation based on range of catenary wire voltage and range of variation rate of the catenary wire voltage; performing the SOC management operation after the ESS is charged or discharged depending on the catenary wire voltage control operation over unit time, if output current of the ESS does not exceed current reference value; and stopping the catenary wire voltage control operation and switching the operation to a standby state.
