abstract
    A combined gas-compressor and dehumidifier system composed of a gas compressor for compressing a first gas, a dehumidifier for dehumidifying a second gas, and a cooling system. The gas compressor is composed of (a) one or more compression stages and (b) one or more intercoolers, wherein the one or more intercoolers are connected to a cooling system. The dehumidifier for dehumidifying a second gas is composed of a first dehumidifying stage that uses a first desiccant to adsorb water from the second gas and output a second intermediate gas, a second dehumidifying stage that uses a second desiccant to adsorb water from the second intermediate gas, and a waste heat exchanger, wherein the waste heat exchanger is used to reactivate the first desiccant. The cooling system is composed of a liquid contained in connectors, and the connectors connecting the one or more intercoolers to remove heat from the gas compressor and provide the removed heat to the dehumidifier.
