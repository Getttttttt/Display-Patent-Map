abstract
    Disclosed herein is a heat recovery steam generator system comprising a vestibule comprising a base plate, a roof and side walls; where the base plate is opposedly disposed to the roof; a heat exchanger space through which an exhaust gas stream is charged; where the vestibule is disposed atop a heat exchanger space; and where the vestibule comprises at least one header in fluid communication with a tube bundle; where a portion of the tube bundle is disposed in the heat exchanger space; and a support system for the tube bundle; where the support system comprises a strap that is reversibly attached to the base plate as well as to the roof of the vestibule or to a structural member in the vestibule; and where each tube of the tube bundle contacts a collar that rests on the base plate.
