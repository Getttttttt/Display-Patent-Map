abstract
    A method and apparatus for controlling a speed change of a hybrid vehicle are provided. The apparatus includes an engine for combustion of fuel to generate power and a motor that is configured to supplement the power from the engine and operate as a generator during braking to generate electrical energy and store the generated electrical energy generated a battery. A transmission is configured to convert the power from the engine to a required torque based on a speed and transmit the power to wheels and is directly connected to the motor. In addition, a controller is configured to operate the transmission to shift in a constant power section of the motor when the motor is performing regenerative braking. The apparatus minimizes the sense of difference felt by a driver by shifting in the constant power section of the motor during the regenerative braking of a hybrid vehicle.
