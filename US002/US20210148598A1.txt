abstract
    An energy recovery system used with HVAC and Air-Conditioning units that is incorporated into a roof-curb, final filter curb assembly or base support structure (roof-curb air plenum) commonly used with mass produced standard or semi-custom manufactured air conditioning systems. The arrangement includes core or wheel type energy recovery media arranged and affixed within the curb or support base in an orientation and method to maximize the amount of energy recovery surface area installed in a minimum area while still allowing good airflow practices. Other items included may be filter racks preceding where air enters the energy recovery cores, a singular or multiple fan(s) to move the air, a condensate drain pan, and a preheat coil or bypass dampers which operate to prevent frosting of the energy recovery surface areas in cold conditions. A direct digital controller may also be included to maximize efficiency and control.
