abstract
    The present Invention provides a device that is capable of charging an electric battery as the vehicle Is driven, thereby extending the mileage of an electric or hybrid vehicle. The device includes a gear assembly that Is built directly into the car rim. The assembly of gears are Installed to rotate with the rotation of the rim, whereby one smaller gear is further connected to a generator, which then provides electricity to the battery with the movement of the gear.
