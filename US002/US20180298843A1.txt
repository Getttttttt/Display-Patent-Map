abstract
    A waste-heat recovery system includes a main power unit, an auxiliary power unit and a transmission unit. The main power unit includes a main engine, a main output shaft that is driven by the main engine, and a heat pipe that is connected to the main engine. The auxiliary power unit includes a stirling engine that is connected to the heat pipe, and an transmission shaft that is driven by the stirling engine. The transmission unit is disposed between the main output shaft and the transmission shaft for transmitting torque from the transmission shaft to the main output shaft.
