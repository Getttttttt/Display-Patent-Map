abstract
    An air conditioning device having an indoor heat exchanger, a heat recovery ventilator, a supply fan, and an exhaust fan inside a housing and configured to perform at least one of cooling/heating, heat recovery ventilation, and pure ventilation. The air conditioning device includes a first flow path configured to guide indoor air while the cooling/heating is performed, a second flow path configured to guide the indoor air toward the heat recovery ventilator, and a third flow path configured to guide outdoor air toward the heat recovery ventilator while the heat recovery ventilation is performed. The air conditioning device includes fourth and fifth flow paths configured to guide indoor air and outdoor air, respectively, and an inlet port that corresponds to the third flow path and the fifth flow path, and a discharge port that corresponds to outlets of the second flow path and the fourth flow path.
