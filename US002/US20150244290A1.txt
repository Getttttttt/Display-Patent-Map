abstract
    The present disclosure is related to a method for regenerative braking of a machine. The machine includes an electric drive assembly. The electric drive assembly includes a generator, a motor and a direct current bus and a regenerative brake assembly disposed between them. The regenerative braking assembly includes an inverter. The method includes connecting a phase leg between the direct current bus and the inverter. The phase leg includes an inductor and an electric switch. The phase leg boosts the regenerative voltage. The boosted regenerative voltage is then fed back to control a braking torque from the motor and directed back to the generator.
