abstract
    A combined cooling, heating and power system is formed by integrating a CO2 and ORC cycle systems, and an LNG cold energy utilization system on the basis of an SOFC/GT hybrid power generation system. The combined systems provide utilization of energy and low carbon dioxide emission. The SOFC/GT is used as a prime mover, high-temperature, medium-temperature, and low-temperature waste heat of the system are recovered through a CO2 and ORC cycles, cold energy (for air conditioning and refrigeration), heat, power, natural gas, ice, and dry ice is provided by using LNG as a cold source of the CO2 cycle and the ORC cycle, and low carbon dioxide emission of the system is achieved by condensation and separation of CO2 from flue gas, so energy losses of the combined system is reduced, and efficient and cascade utilization of energy is achieved, thereby providing energy conservation and emission reduction effect.
