abstract
    An array of energy harvesting units is disclosed. Each unit has a flexible, elongated support with the proximate end fixedly connected to a stationary support such that the flexible beam experiences a mechanical vibration due to flow of a fluid. An active material is disposed on the flexible support that generates an electric current in response to the mechanical vibration. A coupler is provided on each energy harvesting unit such that each is connected to at least one adjacent unit. The resulting array provides an energy output that is greater than the sum of two, uncoupled units.
