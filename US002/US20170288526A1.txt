abstract
    A self-generating power generation system is a generating system that is designed to use a portion of the incoming power to generate additional power to make the system highly efficient. The system may be used in a motor vehicle and take advantage of the available kinetic energy of the turning wheels regenerate power to multiply the efficiency. The system uses two batteries, a brushless dc motor, a generator, gearing, relays, switches, a regulator, a diode, and a controller.
