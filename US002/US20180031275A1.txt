abstract
    A heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) furnace includes a condensing furnace and a condensate removal system associated with the condensing furnace. The condensate removal system includes an electrolyzer having a container that may collect a condensate generated from an exhaust gas produced in the condensing furnace and an electrode disposed within the container and that may apply an electric current to the condensate to electrolyze the condensate and thereby generate condensate gases.
