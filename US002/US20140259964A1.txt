abstract
    The present invention provides an insulation panel used to form part of an exterior element of a buildings envelope for thermal insulation, ventilation, heating and cooling purpose having an internal duct that provides heat exchange between counter flowing waste and fresh air streams, oriented through the panel to minimise undesirable heat transfer. Ventilation air enters beneath the eaves, waste air exits beneath the ridge passing the coil of a reversible heat pump. The paired coil inside the building in the upper roof space within the fresh air stream is used for heating or cooling the building. Ducted waste air, leaving the building at this same position, can be supplied with a water mist before entering the heat exchanger to provide further indirect evaporative cooling of the incoming air stream. The waste air is also used to cool solar panels when fitted to the roof.
