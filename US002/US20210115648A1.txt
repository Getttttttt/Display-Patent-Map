abstract
    A boom system including a hoist boom pivoted to a machine base; a stick boom having a proximal end pivoted to the hoist boom and a distal end configured to carry a working tool; at least one hydraulic hoist cylinder mounted between the machine base and the hoist boom; a first stick cylinder mounted between the hoist boom and the stick boom; a second stick cylinder mounted similarly and mechanically linked with the first stick cylinder; and a hydraulic circuit for supplying hydraulic fluid to the hoist cylinder and stick cylinders, wherein the hydraulic circuit includes a hydraulic conduit line connecting a base end of the at least one hoist cylinder with a base end of the second stick cylinder to allow hydraulic fluid to shunt between the base ends of the hoist cylinder and the second stick cylinder.
