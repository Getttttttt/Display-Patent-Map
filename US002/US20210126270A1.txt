abstract
    Disclosed is a system for determining a hydrogen supply failure of a fuel cell, the system including: a fuel cell, a plurality of hydrogen tanks having hydrogen, a hydrogen supply line connected to the hydrogen tanks and supplying hydrogen from the hydrogen tanks to the fuel cell, a plurality of tank valves mounted on the hydrogen tanks, respectively, and discharging hydrogen in the hydrogen tanks to the hydrogen supply line when opening, a pressure sensor sensing pressure in the hydrogen supply line, and a determiner determining poor opening of the hydrogen tanks on the basis of pressure information sensed by the pressure sensor.
