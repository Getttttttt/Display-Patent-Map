abstract
    An apparatus for transferring recovered power of a waste heat recovery unit (WHRU) includes a hydraulic pump converting the recovered power generated by an expander of the WHRU into a hydraulic energy; and a hydraulic motor converting the hydraulic energy converted by the hydraulic pump into rotational energy and transferring the rotational energy to a vehicle engine.
