abstract
    A control system and control method for a hybrid vehicle, which properly determine based on a predicted charge amount whether or not to change a speed position, to thereby obtain a larger charge amount, thereby making it possible enhance fuel economy of the hybrid vehicle. A first charge amount is estimated which is an amount of electric power charged into a storage battery when regeneration is performed by an electric motor in a state in which the speed position of a stepped transmission is held, for a predetermined regeneration time period. Further, a second charge amount is estimated which is an amount of electric power charged into the storage battery when the speed position is changed to a target speed position within the regeneration time period, and regeneration by the electric motor 4 is performed until the regeneration time period elapses.
