abstract
    A method for controlling a hydraulic brake system where a hydraulic fluid is displaced in the direction of at least two-wheel brakes by means of a brake cylinder. One of the at least two-wheel brakes is at least partially hydraulically isolated from the brake cylinder in order to adapt the at least two-wheel brakes with regard to their hydraulic braking force to an incipient or present wheel load distribution. In addition or alternatively, in the method, it is furthermore the case that at least one volume fraction of the hydraulic fluid is displaced between the at least two wheel brakes in order to adapt the at least two wheel brakes with regard to their hydraulic braking force to a changing wheel load distribution over the course of the braking process and/or to a changing generator braking torque over the course of the braking process.
