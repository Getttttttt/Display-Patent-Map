abstract
    The invention provides a method and apparatus for purifying water. The apparatus includes a water still for receiving water and a hot air maintained in a heat-exchanging relationship to obtain a hot water and a cold air. The apparatus also includes one or more water purification units configured to receive the hot water from the water still in which the hot water is further heated using thermal energy received from one or more thermal energy sources to obtain steam and waste matter. A water purification unit of the one or more water purification units includes a waste matter remover for removing the waste matter from the water purification unit. The water still includes a heat-exchanging unit configured to receive the steam from the one or more water purification units. The steam received at the heat-exchanging unit is condensed to obtain purified water within the heat-exchanging unit using the cold air.
