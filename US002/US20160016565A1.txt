abstract
    A system for applying regenerative braking during high friction coefficient braking of a vehicle includes at least one controller; at least one braking sensor interfacing with the at least one controller; a vehicle powertrain interfacing with the at least one controller; a brake pedal interfacing with the at least one controller; vehicle friction brakes interfacing with the at least one controller; and the at least one controller applies anti-lock braking torque to the vehicle brakes and simultaneously applies regenerative braking torque to the vehicle powertrain responsive to input from the at least one braking sensor. A method for applying regenerative braking during high friction coefficient braking of a vehicle is also disclosed.
