abstract
    A utility vehicle includes: a pair of front wheels; a pair of rear wheels; at least one front wheel power source configured to drive the front wheels and not to drive the rear wheels; at least one rear wheel power source configured to drive the rear wheels and not to drive the front wheels; and a controller that controls the front wheel power source and the rear wheel power source. Upon receiving a predetermined two-wheel drive command, the controller brings the front wheel power source into a non-operative state while allowing the rear wheel power source to drive the rear wheels. Upon receiving a predetermined four-wheel drive command, the controller brings the front wheel power source into operation while allowing the rear wheel power source to drive the rear wheels.
