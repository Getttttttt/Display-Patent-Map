abstract
    A combined internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system is provided. The combined internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system comprises the internal combustion engine, the waste heat recovery system, and a ratio adapting device. The internal combustion engine includes a turbocharger. The waste heat recovery system comprises a condenser, a pump, a heat exchanger, and an expander. The expander is in driving engagement with the turbocharger. The ratio adapting device is drivingly engaged with an output of the internal combustion engine and the expander of the waste heat recovery system. The ratio adapting device may be engaged to transfer energy from at least one of the turbocharger and the expander to the output of the internal combustion engine.
