abstract
    A system for increasing fuel efficiency of a vehicle includes a power source designed to convert a fuel into power and an input device designed to receive user input corresponding to a request to operate in a constant power mode. The system further includes at least one sensor designed to detect vehicle data corresponding to a current power of the power source and a memory designed to store an upper power threshold and a lower power threshold. The system further includes an electronic control unit (ECU) that is designed to determine the current power of the power source based on the detected vehicle data and to control the power source such that the current power remains between the upper power threshold and the lower power threshold when the user input corresponds to the request to operate in the constant power mode.
