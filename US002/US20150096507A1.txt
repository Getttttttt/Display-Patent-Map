abstract
    A supercritical steam generator includes a downdraft furnace enclosure, a hopper tunnel, and a convection pass enclosure, with the hopper tunnel joining the downdraft furnace enclosure and convection pass enclosure together. Flue gas passes down through the downdraft furnace enclosure through the hopper tunnel and up through the convection pass enclosure. This structure permits the outlet steam terminals, which provide access to the resultant supercritical steam and/or reheat steam, to be located at a base of the steam generator rather than at the top of the steam generator as with conventional boilers. This reduces the length of the steam leads from the steam generator to a steam turbine that produces electricity using the supercritical steam.
