abstract
    An apparatus includes a frame and a damper blade moveable between a closed position and an open position. A biasing member is coupled to the frame and exerts a biasing force to urge the damper blade towards a substantially closed position. A magnet coupled to the damper blade exerts a magnetic force to pull the damper blade from the substantially closed position to the closed position. When the damper blade is in the open position and an upstream airflow pressure falls below a first predetermined threshold, the biasing member moves the damper blade to the substantially closed position, and the magnetic force then pulls the damper blade to the closed position, automatically inhibiting airflow through the frame. When the damper blade is in the closed position and an upstream airflow pressure is increased to a second predetermined threshold, the damper blade is released from the closed position.
