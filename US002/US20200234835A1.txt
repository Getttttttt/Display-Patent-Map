abstract
    A coolant recirculation system of a nuclear power plant is provided that may include: a reactor vessel configured to accommodate a reactor core and a reactor coolant therein; a steam generator configured to transfer a gas, converted from a liquid phase to a gaseous phase by exchanging heat with the reactor coolant, to a turbine system; a pressurizer configured to control pressure of the reactor coolant in the reactor vessel; a primary system pressure reducing valve located above the pressurizer and configured to open at a predetermined pressure to discharge the reactor coolant into a containment building for rapid depressurization; and a moisture separator connected to the primary system pressure reducing valve to separate moisture. The moisture separator may separate the reactor coolant into a gaseous phase and a liquid phase. Then, the liquid phase reactor coolant may be returned to the reactor vessel to be recirculated.
