abstract
    A method is provided for controlling regenerative braking torque, which is produced by an electric machine of a vehicle operating in generator mode in a coasting operation mode of the vehicle, in an open-loop or closed-loop manner in accordance with need. The method detects, on the basis of a specified algorithm, an imminent situation in which the speed of a vehicle should be reduced to a speed lower than the current speed. The method outputs a recommendation directed at the driver to release the accelerator when the expected occurrence of such a situation has been detected. If the driver has released the accelerator, the method controls the regenerative braking torque in an open-loop or closed-loop manner in such a way that the vehicle achieves the lower speed without actuation of the service brake when the situation occurs, or, if this cannot be achieved solely via the recuperation torque, maximizes the vehicle deceleration that can be produced by regenerative braking.
