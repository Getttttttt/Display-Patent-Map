abstract
    The embodiments described relate to an expeditionary solid waste disposal system configured to improve logistics and enable it to be readily deployed. The two-stage gasification/oxidation process takes place in a dual chambered device that resembles and functions as a shipping container. Incinerators or other waste conversion devices are commonly containerized by loading the equipment into a standard or modified shipping container. This apparatus is designed as a waste conversion unit that integrates all of the necessary features required to be an ISO-certified shipping container within its structural design such that the waste conversion system and shipping container are one and the same. With correct set-up by 2 persons aided by forklift the system can be configured and operational in a matter of hours.
