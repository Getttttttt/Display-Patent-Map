abstract
    A method of recovering heat from a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) fractionation plant for production of potable water. The method includes heating a buffer fluid via a heat exchanger in the NGL fractionation plant to transfer heat from the NGL fractionation plant to the buffer fluid. The method includes heating feed water with the buffer fluid discharged from the heat exchanger for production of potable water via a multi-effect-distillation (MED) system. The method may include producing potable water with heat from the buffer fluid in the MED system.
