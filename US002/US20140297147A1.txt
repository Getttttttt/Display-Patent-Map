abstract
    Vehicle mass is estimated in a hybrid motor vehicle. Upon determination of a significant change in vehicle mass, adjustments are made to control of the regenerative braking systems and to energy storage levels to improve fuel efficiency. Upon determination of an increase in vehicle mass, the amount of braking force applied to the vehicle by the regenerative braking system in response to brake pedal movement is increased in order to capture more braking energy before friction braking is used.
