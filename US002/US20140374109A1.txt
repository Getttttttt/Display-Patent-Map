abstract
    Methods and systems for enhanced carbon dioxide capture in a combined cycle plant are described. A method includes compressing a recycle exhaust gas from a gas turbine system, thereby producing a compressed recycle exhaust gas stream. A purge stream is extracted from the compressed recycle exhaust gas stream. Carbon dioxide is removed from the extracted purge stream using a solid sorbent.
