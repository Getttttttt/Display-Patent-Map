abstract
    A system for and method of utilizing and generating electrical power is provided. The trailer assist system is configured to engage with a trailer of a tractor trailer or other vehicle, thereby converting the vehicle into a hybrid vehicle and/or a power generation vehicle as the vehicle travels along a road. The trailer assist system includes one or more drive wheel for selective engagement with the road, an electrical motor being selectively configured to provide power to the drive wheel and a regenerative braking system being selectively configured to generate power from the drive wheel. Retractable positioning wheels are selectively deployed to assist in moving the trailer assist into and out of position relative to a trailer, thereby facilitating exchanging one trailer assist system for another trailer assist system. A control system utilizes information from one or more sensor to optimize performance of the trailer assist system.
