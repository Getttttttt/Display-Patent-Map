abstract
    A system and a method for controlling regenerative braking of an electric vehicle are provided. The system and method calculate an available torque considering a battery system and an available torque considering a motor system to improve an accuracy of regenerative braking amount. The method includes calculating an available torque considering a battery system and an available torque considering a motor system when regenerative braking of the electric vehicle is required and calculating a regenerative braking capacity based on the available torque considering the battery system and the available torque considering the motor system.
