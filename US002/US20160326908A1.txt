abstract
    A pulsed pressure, heat recovery system includes a pressure vessel for holding a vaporisable first fluid. The vessel contains a heat exchanger, and provides communication to the heat exchanger for flow of a heated second fluid. The heat exchanger enables heat transfer from the second fluid to vaporise the first fluid. The system also includes a flow loop for the first fluid extending from an outlet of the vessel to an inlet to the vessel, having in series: a first non-return valve, a turbine and a second non-return valve. The first non-return valve allows the vaporised first fluid to flow from the vessel to the turbine when the pressure of the vaporised first fluid in the vessel exceeds a predetermined limit. The turbine extracts energy from expansion of the vaporised first fluid. The second non-return valve prevents flow reversal around flow loop between the turbine and the inlet.
