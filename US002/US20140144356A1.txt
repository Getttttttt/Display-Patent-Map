abstract
    Systems and processes for processing sludge and other natural waste are provided. In one example, the sludge or natural waste may be dried into a powder using high-temperature gas to absorb moisture from the sludge, causing the high-temperature gas to become an at least partially saturated gas. The at least partially saturated gas may pass through a scrubber before being heated in an air-heater and used in the moisture absorption process. The heat for the air-heater may be provided by a burner operable to burn the dried powder obtained from the sludge. The heated gas may be used to pre-heat the saturated gas and may be used to dry additional sludge.
