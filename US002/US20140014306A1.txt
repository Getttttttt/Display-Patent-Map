abstract
    A heat exchanger of the fumes-water type configured to couple with a burner for the manufacture of boilers for domestic or industrial use. The heat exchanger includes an exchanging body (2) made of die-cast aluminum with two half-shells (2 a and 2 b), to be mounted in a mutually opposing fashion, and enclosed within a casing (3), made of a plastic or aluminum material, formed of two half-parts (3 a and 3 b) to couple in order to contain therewithin the exchanging body, thus constituting two seats, one internal one for the flow of fumes and the other, external, one for the flow of water, which runs upwards from the bottom, passing all around the exchanging body with a partly parallel and partly spiral route. The exchanger is of the “cross flow” type, where the input on the water side corresponds with the heat exchanger fumes output and allows high heat exchange performance.
