abstract
    A method for maximizing regenerative energy captured by an electric machine in a powertrain including an engine, the electric machine and a transmission device configured to transfer torque through a driveline includes detecting an operator brake request and monitoring a time between the detected operator brake request and a preceding operator brake request that was last detected. A maximized regenerative deceleration event is initiated if the time exceeds a predetermined threshold time that includes monitoring a current fixed gear ratio that is selected from among a plurality of fixed gear ratios of the transmission device when the operator brake request is detected and applying a magnitude of torque at the axle that is sufficient for achieving a maximum capability of the electric machine to capture regenerative energy in the current fixed gear ratio.
