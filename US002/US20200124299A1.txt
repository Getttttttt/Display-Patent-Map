abstract
    An air-conditioning system includes: a dehumidifying unit configured to mix air discharged from an environmental testing chamber with outside air for dehumidification and to discharge dry air; a dry air thermal controlling unit configured to thermally control the dry air discharged from the dehumidifying unit to have a temperature lower than a preset air temperature inside the environmental testing chamber; and a dry air heating unit configured to heat the dry air thermally controlled by the dry air thermal controlling unit up to the preset air temperature and to supply the dry air to the environmental testing chamber. The dehumidifying unit preferably discharges the dry air having a dew point temperature of −30° C. or less.
