abstract
    The energy output of a power plant combustion chamber that combusts fuel comprising biomass as all or part of the fuel can be increased by feeding oxygen into the combustion chamber so that said fuel is in contact with gaseous oxidant whose oxygen content exceeds that of air by up to 5 vol. % above that of air.
