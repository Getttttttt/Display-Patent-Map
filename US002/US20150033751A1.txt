abstract
    A system includes a compressor configured to compress a gaseous stream, an exhaust gas cooler configured to cool an exhaust gas from combustion with a cooling water, and a water injection system configured to inject the cooling water from the exhaust gas cooler into at least one of a compressor inlet of the compressor, a stage of the compressor, between stages of the compressor, or an inlet duct coupled to the compressor inlet of the compressor, or any combination thereof.
