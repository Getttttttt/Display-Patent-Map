abstract
    A method for removing gas from a storage vessel and returning it along with a liquid feed to the vessel. The gas such as natural gas is withdrawn from the storage vessel and fed to a venturi device where it is combined with a feed of liquid to the venturi device. The gas will combine with the liquid feed in the venturi device while the pressure in the storage vessel will be decreased thereby reducing the need for venting and increasing efficiency of the storage vessel.
