abstract
    Systems of an electrical vehicle and the operations thereof are provided. Embodiments include an electric vehicle, rechargeable electric vehicle, and/or hybrid-electric vehicle and associated systems. The electric vehicle includes redundant vehicle control systems that monitor each other to prevent a dangerous reduction or change in torque to the electric motor(s). By monitoring each other, the redundant VCUs can ensure that a failure of the opposite VCU does not endanger the vehicle and may be shut down when the opposite VCU when the VCU's behavior is outside acceptable operating circumstances.
