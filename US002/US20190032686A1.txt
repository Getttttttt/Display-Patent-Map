abstract
    An energy-saving charge/discharge method controls the repeated charging and discharging of a working vessel in a manner that enables the storage and subsequent reuse of compressed gas during the repeated charge and discharge cycle. In contrast to the methods of the prior art, the method does not discard the entire mass of compressed gas during each discharge phase of the cycle. An energy savings results from the recycling of compressed gas, which reduces the net consumption of compressed gas for a given charge/discharge cycle of a given pressure vessel. A minimum amount of apparatus is required to implement the recycling of compressed gas.
