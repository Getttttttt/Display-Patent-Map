abstract
    A process gas preparation device for an industrial furnace system is disclosed. The gas preparation device includes a preparation reactor having a catalyst. A gas feed line and a gas return line are connected between the industrial furnace and the preparation reactor to form a closed loop. A compressor is situated upstream from the preparation reactor in the feed line. The preparation reactor is also connected with supply lines for hydrocarbon gas and air to be supplied to the preparation reactor. The process gas preparation device also includes a control device with which process gas preparation and return can be regulated and controlled. The gas feed line also has a shut-off valve. The control device can check the functional state of the catalyst by measuring the pressure differential across the catalyst and can initiate a burn-out process therein to clear clogging of the catalyst.
