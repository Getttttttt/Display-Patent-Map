abstract
    A hybrid electric vehicle having one or more controllers, at least two independently driven electric machines (EMs) that are each coupled to separate drive wheels, and controllers configured to generate a torque split ratio responsive to lateral acceleration and/or unequal friction coefficients detected during braking, and to generate electric power with the motors by regeneratively braking each wheel with unequal torques adjusted by the ratio, such that combined wheel braking torques do not exceed a total braking torque limit for the vehicle. In some configurations, the controller(s) generate the torque split ratio by a predetermined lookup table that maps a plurality of torque split ratios to lateral accelerations, the coefficients, and other parameters. Further arrangements include the controller(s) coupled with sensors that detect wheel slip and yaw rate, and responsive to a braking signal, the controller(s) disengage regenerative braking when the wheel slip and/or vehicle yaw are detected.
