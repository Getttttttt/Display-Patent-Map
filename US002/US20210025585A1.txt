abstract
    A modular pressurized combustion system for flexible energy generation is provided. The system comprises a plurality of pressurized combustion boilers, at least one compressor configured to provide pressurized oxidizer gas to each of the plurality of pressurized combustion boilers in parallel, and at least one feeder configured to provide fuel to each of the plurality of pressurized combustion boilers in parallel. The system further comprises a flue gas input unit configured to provide recycled flue gas to each of the plurality of pressurized combustion boilers in series, at least one pressurized heat recovery unit configured to receive a flue gas output stream from each of the plurality of pressurized combustion boilers, and at least one particle filter configured to filter a flue gas output stream from the pressurized heat recovery unit. The system also comprises an integrated pollutant removal unit.
