abstract
    A vehicle is provided that stores user information associated with a user in the vehicle and vehicle information associated with the vehicle (the vehicle information comprises a vehicle identification number of the vehicle, an electronic serial number associated with the vehicle, and/or an engine code of the vehicle), determines the user desires to interact with a third party, retrieves the user and vehicle information from the memory, combines the user information and the vehicle information into a first communication for the third party, and automatically sends the first communication to the third party for the user to authenticate the user to the third party.
