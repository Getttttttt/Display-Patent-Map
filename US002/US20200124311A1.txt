abstract
    In some examples, an apparatus for and method of heating, ventilation and/or air conditioning of an interior space of a structure. The apparatus can include a heat exchanger core, a first blower in fluid connection with a first side of the heat exchanger core, a second blower in fluid connection with a second side of the heat exchanger core, at least one sensor collecting pressure data, and a control component. The control component can operate the first and second blowers to reduce a difference in pressure between the first and second sides of the heat exchanger core.
