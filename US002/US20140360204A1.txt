abstract
    The present techniques are directed to systems and a method for extracting a high pressure gas from a power plant. A method includes providing a fuel to a burner, and providing an oxidant to the burner, wherein an oxidant flow rate is adjusted to provide a substantially stoichiometric ratio of the oxidant to the fuel. The fuel and the oxidant are combusted in the burner to produce an exhaust gas. At least a portion of the exhaust gas is extracted downstream of the burner to form a product gas.
