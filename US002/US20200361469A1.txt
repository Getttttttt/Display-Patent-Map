abstract
    This disclosure relates to an electrified vehicle configured to selectively increase an energy recovery threshold and a corresponding method. In particular, an example electrified vehicle includes an energy recovery mechanism configured to apply a negative wheel torque up to a negative wheel torque threshold. The electrified vehicle also includes a controller configured to selectively increase the negative wheel torque threshold based on a mass of the electrified vehicle.
