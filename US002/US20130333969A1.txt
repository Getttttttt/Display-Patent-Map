abstract
    The aim of the invention is to lower the fuel consumption of a vehicle having a pneumatic brake system during operation of the vehicle by utilizing existing components to their full capacity, thus contributing to energy conservation. The invention relates to a method for controlling pressure, wherein modes of compressed air expansion are provided: in a second compressed-air expansion mode, compressed air is channeled from a second compressed-air storage container to the compression chamber of the air compressor during expansion phases of the air compressor. In a third compressed-air expansion mode, compressed air is channeled from a third compressed-air storage container to the compression chamber of the air compressor during expansion phases of the air compressor. The invention further relates to a pressure control device.
