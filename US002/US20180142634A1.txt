abstract
    An evaporative emissions (EVAP) system for a vehicle includes a waste heat control valve configured to direct an exhaust gas from an exhaust treatment system, the waste heat control valve being positioned at a point downstream from a catalyst of the exhaust treatment system, a vapor canister configured to store a fuel vapor evaporated from a liquid fuel housed in a fuel tank of the vehicle, and a heat exchanger connected to (i) the fuel tank, (ii) the waste heat control valve, and (iii) the vapor canister, the heat exchanger being configured to (a) utilize the exhaust waste heat to evaporate the fuel vapor from the liquid fuel and (b) provide the evaporated fuel vapor to the vapor canister. A method of operating the EVAP system includes controlling the waste heat control valve and a fuel pump to provide the vapor canister with a desired amount of fuel vapor.
