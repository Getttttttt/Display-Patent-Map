abstract
    An energy exchange system includes a supply flow path including a central sub-path connected to a bypass sub-path that is, in turn, connected to a delivery sub-path that connects to the enclosed structure. A sensible heat exchanger configured to condition the supply air is disposed within the central sub-path. The bypass sub-path connects to the central sub-path upstream from the sensible heat exchanger within the central sub-path. A first coil configured to further condition the supply air is disposed within the central sub-path downstream from the sensible heat exchanger. A bypass damper is disposed within the bypass sub-path. The bypass damper is configured to be selectively opened and closed. The bypass damper allows at least a portion of the supply air to pass through the bypass sub-path into the delivery sub-path and bypass the sensible heat exchanger and the first coil when the bypass damper is open.
