abstract
    An apparatus and method are disclosed that enable a multi-spool gas turbine engine to produce ISO-qualified power quality during block loading, while also achieving high efficiency over a wide power range. Such an engine would enable new markets, including modern data centers, to operate independently from the utility grid, while achieving high efficiency, reliability, and power quality. The engine includes a variable area nozzle upstream of the free power turbine. On experiencing the torque spike, the variable area nozzle is opened rapidly to provide rapid an increase in air flow aspirated by the engine. When combined with a proportionally increased fuel supply, the power and torque of the free power turbine increases with a time constant close to that of the fuel valve and variable area nozzle movement. Coupling a variable speed alternator to the free power turbine, and coupling the rectified alternator output to an inverter serves to isolate the speed change of the alternator from the frequency delivered to the power grid.
