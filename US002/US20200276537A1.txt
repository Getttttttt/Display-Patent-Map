abstract
    A process for the production of formaldehyde is disclosed. The process comprises feeding a feed stream comprising methanol to a reactor; converting the methanol to formaldehyde in the reactor using a mixed oxide catalyst to produce a process stream comprising formaldehyde; separating formaldehyde from the process stream to create a product stream comprising formaldehyde and a waste gas stream; feeding at least part of the waste gas stream to a steam condenser to raise the temperature of the at least part of the waste gas stream to create a heated waste gas stream; and feeding the heated waste gas stream to a catalytic combustion bed to catalytically combust components of the heated waste gas stream to create a combusted waste gas stream.
