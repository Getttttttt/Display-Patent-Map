abstract
    A partially-reduced iron producing apparatus includes: an exhaust gas circulating device supplying an oxygen-containing gas to raw-material pellets to be heated by ignition of raw-material pellets, the oxygen-containing gas made by circulating part of an exhaust gas by use of the heat of the ignition raw-material pellets and mixing the discharged exhaust gas with air; and a liquid-tar separating device which is provided in the exhaust gas circulating device. A partially-reduced iron is produced by heating and reducing the whole of the raw-material pellets in a bed height direction thereof through a combustion region for the raw-material pellets and a heating region for the raw-material pellets, the combustion region formed on an upstream side of an endless grate by supplying the gas having a high oxygen concentration; and the heating region formed downstream of the combustion region of the endless grate by supplying the gas having a low oxygen concentration.
