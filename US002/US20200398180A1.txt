abstract
    Methods and apparatus consistent with the present disclosure may provide electrical energy and thermal to extraction or separation equipment. Methods and apparatus consistent with the present disclosure may extract and concentrate essential elements plant matter. An amount of wasted heat energy collected from a engine that powers an electrical generator may be provided to an evaporation or separation process when electrical power is provided to extraction or separation processing equipment. Computers or electronics that control equipment consistent with the present disclosure may be remotely controlled via a mobile electronic device, when desired. Such computers or electronics may receive sensor data related to the operation of plat matter extractors, related separation equipment, or other equipment may be used to manage a production line. As such, methods and apparatus consistent with the present disclosure may extract essential elements from cannabis plant matter and process those essential elements into cannabis extracts or isolates.
