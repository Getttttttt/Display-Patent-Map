abstract
    The movement speed v of a moving body having drive wheels driven by a motor, the rotational speed ω of the drive wheels of the moving body, and the actual torque value Tm generated by the motor are acquired. Subsequently, a slip rate estimation unit (741) estimates the slip rate λ of the drive wheels on the basis of the movement speed v and the rotation speed ω. Further, a drive torque estimation unit (742) estimates the drive torque Td of the drive wheels on the basis of the rotational speed ω and the actual torque value Tm. Next, a limit value calculation unit (743) calculates a limit value L for a torque command value Tc on the basis of the slip rate λ and the drive torque Td. Further, a limiter unit (744) limits the torque command value Tc using the limit value L, generates a torque setting value Ts, and sends the generated torque setting value Ts to a motor drive system (900). As a result, it is possible to quickly realize control in accordance with changes in the road surface state, thus allowing safe travel while ensuring the needed drive power.
