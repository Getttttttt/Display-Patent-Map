abstract
    Provided is an electric brake device that achieves improved responsiveness, cost reduction and also reduces the copper loss in an electric motor, thus reducing power consumption. The electric brake device includes a brake rotor (8), a friction member (9), a friction member actuator (6), an electric motor (4), a controller (2), a main power supply (3), and an auxiliary power supply (22). The auxiliary supply (22) is charged with regenerative power from the motor (4). The controller (2) includes a backflow power interruption (26) preventing the main supply (3) from being charged with the regenerative power from the motor (4), and an auxiliary power supply controller (24) causing the auxiliary supply (22) to supply running power to the motor (4) when powering the electric (4) is started in a state in which the regenerative power in the auxiliary supply (22) is greater than or equal to a set voltage.
