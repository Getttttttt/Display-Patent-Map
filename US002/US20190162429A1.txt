abstract
    A heat and mass exchange (HMX) device comprising a plurality of membranes arranged in a stack. Adjacent membranes are separated from one another by an airflow channel Each membrane of the stack comprises an array of integrated support structures that extend into the airflow channel and to the second membrane. The support structures comprise an adhesive material that is bonded to each membrane. The support structures divide the airflow channels into subchannels.
