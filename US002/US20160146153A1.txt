abstract
    A method of controlling facility power requirements using a thermoacoustic power device is provided that includes determining energy assets in a facility, controlling the energy assets using an appropriately programmed controller across a network having a security system protocol, monitoring outside temperatures and weather, measuring usage of the energy assets using a temperature sensor or an electrical usage sensor to a load-response signal of an on/off operation and usage of the energy assets to identify a specific energy asset by the controller to determine aggregate energy needs of the energy assets, and using a thermoacoustic power device controlled by the controller to generate electricity and heat according to the monitored temperature, weather and energy assets.
