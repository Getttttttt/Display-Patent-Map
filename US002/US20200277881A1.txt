abstract
    Disclosed is a process that combines interacting main processes and sub-processes to extract kinetic energy from thermal energy. These different interacting processes and sub-processes are physically separate from each other with the main processes operating as closed cycles that operate with two different process fluids parallel to each other and interact with each other, in order to consider and utilize sufficiently all three forms of energy, i.e. thermal energy, kinetic energy, and the energy of the phase changes. By interacting, these different main processes and sub-processes enable a ‘combined-process’ that especially allows the highly efficient transformation of low temperature thermal energy into kinetic energy. Also disclosed is a system for carrying out the process.
