abstract
    In a braking force control system for a vehicle, braking is performed by distributing a braking force required for braking the vehicle to the regenerative braking force and the friction braking force. The regenerative braking force and the friction braking force are re-distributed by predicting a nose dive phenomenon of the vehicle, whereby the occurrence of the nose dive phenomenon is prevented by minimizing damping control of an electronic control suspension (ECS). Thus, an excessive operation of the ECS may be prevented.
