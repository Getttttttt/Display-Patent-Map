abstract
    A thermoelectric device may include a housing made of a plastic, which may partially limit an interior space and which may include a first side wall and a second side wall lying opposite to the first side wall, and a thermoelectric element made of a thermoelectrically active material arranged in the interior space. The first electrical connection element may be arranged on an inner side of the first side wall, and a second electrical connection element may be arranged on an inner side of the second side wall. The first electrical connection element may be connected in a substance-to-substance manner to a first front side of the thermoelectric element facing the first side wall, and the second electrical connection element may be connected to a second front side of the thermoelectric element facing the second side wall.
