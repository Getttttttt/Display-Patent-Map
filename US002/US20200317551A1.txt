abstract
    Disclosed is a device for services related to providing hot water, to water treatment, to the cleaning of any fixed or mobile surfaces like lines for proving potable water or food liquid, remarkable in that it is mobile, includes an internal chassis housing in the lower part a tank for recovering possible fluids and a subassembly for producing hot water with at least one condensing boiler associated with at least one module for supplying gas formed by a plurality of gas cylinders of the carburation type storing in their internal volume the gas in the liquid state in the lower part and in the gaseous state in the upper part, the gas cylinders being disposed in the internal chassis substantially horizontally and with the opening orifice oriented upwards so that the end of the pipe for passage of the gas opens onto a larger elongated gaseous part.
