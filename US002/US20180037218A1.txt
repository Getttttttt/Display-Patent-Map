abstract
    A control system for a vehicle includes: a motor-generator to regenerate an electric power; a secondary battery to be charged with the electric power regenerated by the motor-generator; an electrical load to be activated with an electric power supplied from at least one of the motor-generator and the secondary battery; a power supply device to supply the electrical load with the electric power generated by the motor-generator based on a deceleration power generated by a braking operation of the vehicle; and an electronic control unit to calculate excess power which is electric power exceeding chargeable power with which the secondary battery is chargeable of a required deceleration power required by the braking operation, and to control the power supply device in accordance with a command value for causing the electric power supplied from the power supply device to the electrical load to be less than the excess power.
