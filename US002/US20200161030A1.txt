abstract
    A power diffusing assembly includes a power diffusing body disposed along a flow path of a compressible fluid. The power diffusing body includes passages extending through the power diffusing body and through which at least part of the fluid flows through the power diffusing body. The power diffusing body receives an incoming flow profile of the fluid on an inlet side of the power diffusing body, directs the fluid through the passages in the power diffusing body, and outputs an outgoing flow profile of the fluid out of an outlet side of the power diffusing body. Arrangements of the passages in the power diffusing body are based on the incoming flow profile of the fluid that are received by the power diffusing body and are based on a desired profile of the outgoing flow profile of the fluid exiting out of the power diffusing body.
