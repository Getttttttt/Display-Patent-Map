abstract
    A driving system includes: a motor; a power transmission device; a motor controller; an application force controller; and an application force acquiring device. When the motor controller receives a request for generation of power in such a state that the motor generates no power, the motor controller controls to permit and/or prohibit the generation of power of the motor based on the current application force and a necessary application force which is an application force of the power transmission device that is needed to transmit a maximum generation power of the motor in a current rotating state quantity which is a rotating state quantity that the motor is currently having.
