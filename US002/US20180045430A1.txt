abstract
    An energy recovery assembly for transferring thermal energy between outgoing exhaust air and incoming supply air. The energy recovery assembly comprises a bead receiving conduit section configured to receive and retain a plurality of beads made of thermal conductive material therein, and at least one bead inlet and at least one bead outlet for each bead receiving conduit section. The bead receiving conduit section is positioned across the air transfer path of the ventilation system. Each one of the at least one bead inlet is configurable between an open configuration allowing introduction of beads in the bead receiving conduit section and a closed configuration preventing introduction of the beads therein. Each one of the at least one bead outlet is configurable between an open configuration allowing removal of the beads from the bead receiving conduit section and a closed configuration preventing removal of beads therefrom.
