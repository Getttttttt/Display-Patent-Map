abstract
    Provided is a gas furnace. The gas furnace includes: a manifold with an exhaust port for discharging fuel gas; a nozzle attached to the exhaust port; a burner for burning a mixture of air and fuel gas ejected from the nozzle; a primary heat exchanger that provides a first flow path and allows a combustion gas produced by the combustion of the mixture to move through the first flow path; and a secondary heat exchanger located adjacent to the primary heat exchanger, that provides a second flow path and allows the combustion gas discharged from the primary heat exchanger to move through the second flow path, wherein the secondary heat exchanger includes: at least one tube forming the second flow path; and a baffle inserted into the at least one tube, the baffle including: a plate longitudinally extending in a lengthwise direction and twisted in the shape of a screw; and a plurality of holes formed to penetrate the plate.
