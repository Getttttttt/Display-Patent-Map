abstract
    A system for controlled recovery of thermal energy and conversion to mechanical energy. The system collects thermal energy from a reciprocating engine, specifically from engine jacket fluid and/or engine exhaust and uses this thermal energy to generate a secondary power source by evaporating an organic propellant and using the gaseous propellant to drive an expander in production of mechanical energy. A predictive control circuit utilizes ambient and system conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow of organic propellant at one or more locations. The predictive control module regulates system parameters in advance based on monitored information to optimize secondary power output. A thermal fluid heater may be used to heat propellant. The system may be used to meet on-site power demands using primary, secondary, and tertiary power.
