abstract
    A vehicle stability control system includes a signal collection sensor and a vehicle controller (10). The signal collection sensor is configured to collect a vehicle condition information parameter, and the vehicle controller (10) is configured to calculate a control yaw moment according to the vehicle condition information parameter. The control yaw moment is used to cancel a difference between an estimated yaw moment and an actual yaw moment. The vehicle controller (10) is further configured to determine according to the vehicle condition information parameter whether the vehicle (100) is in a stable region or a non-stable region in the case of tire blow-out, and allocate the control yaw moment to four wheels (101) according to a vehicle stability condition, thus implementing vehicle stability control. A vehicle stability control method and a vehicle (100) with the vehicle stability control system are also disclosed.
