abstract
    This disclosure generally relates to lightweight thermionic microengines for aerial vehicles. The aerial vehicles include a propulsion system. The propulsion system includes a combustor. The propulsion system further includes a thermionic generator that receives heat from the combustor and generates electricity. The propulsion system further includes one or more propulsion motors that receive the electricity generated by the thermionic generator. The propulsion motors may provide power to one or more propellers to generate lift and thrust for a UAV.
