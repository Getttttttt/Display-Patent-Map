abstract
    In an electric automobile traveling by driving a rear wheel with an electric motor mounted on a vehicle body rear part, a load distributed to the rear wheel is larger than a load distributed to a front wheel by an amount corresponding to a weight of the electric motor. Therefore, it is desirable that a braking force distribution amount to the rear wheel be larger than that to the front wheel. Without providing a proportional pressure reducing valve changing a ratio of braking force distributed between the front and rear wheels, it is possible, by supplying a same brake fluid pressure from a master cylinder to front and rear wheel brake calipers and carrying out regenerative braking in the rear wheel, to make the braking force distribution amount to the rear wheel larger than that to the front wheel.
