abstract
    A software-defined powertrain transmits commands to at least 4 distributed polyphase motor controllers. A single vehicle control unit transforms operator control indicia into a plurality of individual commands, and securely transmits said commands to each one of a plurality of independent motor controllers mechanically coupled to a single wheel by a polyphase electric motor. The motor controllers are DC to variable AC electrical converters which each receives phase and magnitude requirements. A mixed criticality operating system provides an encrypted application-programming interface to operate functions such as torque vectoring, cooling, braking, and battery management. The OS provides an isolated trust zone to each of a plurality of cores for authentication and validation.
