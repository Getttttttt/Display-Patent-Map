abstract
    In one embodiment, an exhaust heat collecting system of collecting exhaust heat in a fluid treatment system. The fluid treatment system includes a fluid path to convey at least an operating fluid or a cooled fluid among first and second heat source fluids, the operating fluid and the cooled fluid. The fluid treatment system further includes a fluid treatment module including an expansion module, a power generator and a condenser for the operating fluid, or including a heat absorbing module and a heat releasing module for the cooled fluid. The exhaust heat collecting system includes a water path to heat water by using the condenser or the heat releasing module, and a heater to heat the water from the water path by using the first or second heat source fluid or the operating fluid to produce the water to be used as hot water or to produce steam.
