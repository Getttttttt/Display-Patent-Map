abstract
    An apparatus for controlling a transmission of a vehicle includes a determination device that determines whether a condition for a regenerative braking based lift foot up shift is satisfied, a controller that performs regenerative brake control and performs a shift by controlling release clutch torque and lock-up clutch torque, when the condition for the regenerative braking based lift foot up shift is satisfied, and a torque compensation device that compensates for the release clutch torque according to an RPM variation during the shift.
