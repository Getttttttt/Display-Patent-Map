abstract
    The Road-and-air transport vehicle is intended to transport people (from 1 to 4 people] on the roads, as a light passenger vehicle, and in the air—as a small aircraft. It has a body (1] with a cabin (13), 4 wheels: 2 front wheels, controllable (2) and 2 rear wheels driven (48] by two electric motors (51,52), fitted to the wheel rims, or by the main back propeller engine (28)—electric or with internal combustion which has a variable vector of the propelling force—for a short landing strip and big maneuverability, as well as several wings: 2 front telescopic wings (5,7) and (11,14), with variable angle of attack for short take-off way and big maneuverability; 2 main movable wings (19,43), whole, with bent edges, folded to the body (when it is on the road), and unfolded (when the vehicle is flying), as by means of rotation by different devices they change their swept position during the flight, they have elevons (79) and rotating flaps (77), which increase their lifting force at taking off—for short drive take-off way, while during the flight they generate electricity; additional wings: 1 bottom wing (40), 1 upper wing (38) and 1 rear wing (33), carrying two vertical stabilizers (30,32 with steering wheels 84,85) connected fixedly by the upper back wing (31 with 2 horizontal steering wheels 86,87), forming the tailpiece. It is fitted with 2 propellers (27,35) or 2 turbine (58,59) electrical motors—generators, which during the flight produce electricity, but in case of fault of the main engine (28) they replace it—for the purpose of safe landing. For maximum safety the Road-and-air transport vehicle is fitted with a parachute module (75), which lands the whole craft. All external surfaces of the wings, the body and the cabin are covered with photovoltaic elements and together with the other generators they charge a unit of accumulators and capacitors. The Road-and-air transport vehicle is intended for mass use for personal purposes (flying cars) or for public (ambulances, taxis, postal carriers, police patrols, fire-department vehicles, for military and other) purposes.
