abstract
    The present application relates to a vehicle and a method of limiting a vehicle speed during evacuation running designed to prevent a normal battery block from being overcharged by regenerative electric power during evacuation running, in which a vehicle driven by a parallely connected battery blocks runs under a condition in which some abnormal battery blocks are separated. The method may include determining whether a vehicle is performing evacuation running, calculating receivable regenerative electric power for the battery blocks used for running of the vehicle, calculating a limit speed of the vehicle according to the receivable regenerative electric power, and limiting the speed of the vehicle to the limit speed or to a speed lower than the limit speed.
