abstract
    A locomotive assembly is provided. The locomotive assembly includes a locomotive having a power source configured to generate mechanical power. The locomotive also includes a generator configured to generate electrical power. The locomotive further includes an electric motor configured to provide motive power to the locomotive. The locomotive assembly also includes an auxiliary vehicle haying a power receiving device configured to receive electrical power from an external power grid. The auxiliary vehicle also includes a transformer and a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker and the transformer are configured to control the electrical power received by the power receiving device. The auxiliary vehicle further includes a cooling system configured to control a temperature of the transformer. The transformer is further electrically coupled to the electric motor of the locomotive to selectively provide electrical power to the locomotive.
