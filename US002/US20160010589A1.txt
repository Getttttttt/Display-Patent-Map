abstract
    A gas turbine engine propulsion system in which a first propulsive unit has a core engine and a first low pressure turbine arranged to be driven by combustion products from the core engine. The first propulsive unit also has a first fan rotor and a first fan shaft drivingly connecting the first turbine and the first fan rotor. The propulsion system also has a further turbine arranged in flow series with the first turbine and a second propulsive unit spaced from the first propulsive unit. The second propulsive unit has a second fan rotor driven by the rotational output of the further turbine. The further turbine may be located in the second propulsive unit and may be in fluid communication with the first turbine via an inter-turbine duct.
