abstract
    A gas turbine system includes an exhaust gas processing system that includes an exhaust stack having a first inlet and a first outlet. The first inlet is fluidly coupled to a second outlet of a cooler configured to direct the exhaust gas to the exhaust gas processing system via a first conduit extending between the exhaust stack and the cooler. The first conduit includes a first end configured to be directly coupled to the second outlet of the cooler and a second end configured to be directly coupled to the first inlet of the exhaust stack. The exhaust gas processing system also includes a carbon capture system disposed within the exhaust stack and configured to receive a carbon dioxide (CO2) lean solvent, to remove CO2 from the exhaust gas, to generate a CO2-rich solvent comprising the CO2 removed from the exhaust gas, and to generate a treated exhaust gas.
