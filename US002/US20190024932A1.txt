abstract
    A hybrid air conditioning apparatus includes a first air conditioning device and a second air conditioning device. The first air conditioning device is a cooling and heating air conditioner, and the second air conditioning device communicates with the first air conditioning device. Air modulated by the second air conditioning device is sent to the first air conditioning device for cooling and heating air adjustment. Accordingly, the air discharged from the first air conditioning device has enhanced quality and all kinds of properties in the air are provided uniformly.
