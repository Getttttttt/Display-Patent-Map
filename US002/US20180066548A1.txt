abstract
    A combined cycle power plant is provided. The combined cycle power plant includes a gas turbine and a heat recovery steam generator disposed in fluid communication with the gas turbine and including one or more steam heater units. Additionally, the combined cycle power plant includes a recuperator unit integrated with the heat recovery steam generator and configured to use gas turbine exhaust from the gas turbine to preheat compressor discharge air from the compressor and supply the preheated compressor discharge air to the combustor, where a first subset of the one or more steam heater units is disposed in parallel to the recuperator unit, and where a second subset of the one or more steam heater units is disposed in series with the first subset of the one or more steam heater units and the recuperator unit with respect to a direction of flow of gas turbine exhaust.
