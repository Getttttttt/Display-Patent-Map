abstract
    A gas-fired instantaneous water heater including a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and a heat pump that is powered by the TEG to improve efficiency compared to existing water heaters. Water to be heated is circulated through the heat pump, TEG heat exchanger, and primary heat exchanger to produce a stream of heated water. An adjustable firing rate permeable matrix radiant burner is included, in which natural gas and air are combusted to produce combustion products, including heat. The combustion products are condensed in a condensing system to produce cooled and dry exhaust gas.
