abstract
    The disclosure is directed at a method and apparatus for an active convertor dolly for use in a tractor-trailer configuration. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a system to connect a tractor to a trailer. The apparatus further includes a charge generating system for translating the mechanical motions or actions of the dolly into electricity or electrical energy so that this energy can be used to charge a battery or to power other functionality for either the dolly or the tractor-trailer. The active dolly may also operate to assist in shunting the tractor-trailer.
