abstract
    A combustion system of a composite heat carrier generator comprises combustion and vaporization chambers. The combustion chamber comprises a main body and a head portion connected thereto. The head portion comprises an outer shell, a cyclone, and fuel receiving, fuel spray nozzle, water receiving, and air receiving nozzles. The fuel receiving and fuel spray nozzles are connected. The air receiving nozzle forms an air inlet cavity in communication with the fuel spray nozzle and the cyclone. The cyclone includes a pre-combustion chamber facing the fuel spray nozzle and a groove. The pre-combustion chamber receives a mixture of fuel and air, and the cyclone groove introduces air.
