abstract
    Aspects of the invention provide a heat exchanger including a shell at least partially defining an interior region; a burner positioned to deliver combustion gases into the interior region; and a plurality of tubes configured to circulate water therein, the plurality of tubes extending through the interior region. The plurality of tubes further including an inner set of tubes and an outer set of tubes, the inner set of tubes being closer to the burner than the outer set of tubes. The inner set of tubes and the outer set of tubes being positioned adjacent to one another such that the outer set of tubes is staggered from the inner set of tubes and tubes of the outer set of tubes are adjacent to tubes of the inner set of tubes. Additionally, baffle segments are annularly positioned in the interior region adjacent the plurality of tubes. Adjacent baffle segments defining gaps for the flow of the combustion gases.
