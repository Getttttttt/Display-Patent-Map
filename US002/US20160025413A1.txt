abstract
    The invention relates to a pipe bundle recuperator on a sintering furnace for thermal transfer between at least one first fluid, a second fluid and a third fluid. The pipe bundle recuperator comprises the following: at least one first pipe bundle having a first pipe bundle entrance, a first pipe and a first pipe bundle exit for guiding the first fluid and at least one second pipe bundle having a second pipe bundle entrance, a second pipe and a second pipe bundle exit for guiding the second fluid, an outside pipe for guiding the third fluid, wherein the first pipe bundle and the second pipe bundle are arranged at least partially within the outside pipe, and, additionally, a fluid conducting system arranged in an interior region of the outside pipe for forced guidance of the third fluid along a course which is helical at least in regions, wherein the fluid conducting system has at least one first fluid conducting component. The invention further relates to a thermal transfer method having a sintering furnace and having a pipe bundle recuperator.
