abstract
    A method and a plant for the production of pig iron or liquid steel semi-finished products are shown, metal oxide-containing batch materials and, if appropriate, aggregates being at least partially reduced in a reduction zone by a reduction gas, subsequently being introduced into a smelting zone and being smelted along with the supply of carbon carriers and oxygen-containing gas and along with the formation of the reduction gas. The reduction gas formed in the smelting zone is supplied to the reduction zone, reacted there and drawn off as export gas, CO2 is separated from the export gas, and a product gas is formed which is utilized for the introduction of pulverulent carbon carriers into the smelting zone.
