abstract
    A gas turbine fuel heating system is disclosed having at least one coalescing filter configured to accept a main fuel supply and a plurality of fuel circuit heaters. Each fuel circuit heater can be configured to accept an independent fuel circuit portion of the main fuel supply leaving the at least one coalescing filter and also configured to accept a heating medium circuit portion of a heating medium. The system can have a plurality of scrubbers, a plurality of fuel circuit manifolds, and a plurality of fuel premix tubes. A controller circuit determines the MWI for each independent fuel circuit portion and adjusts the heating medium circuit portion passed to the corresponding fuel circuit heater to maintain at least one parameter selected from the group consisting of a baseline independent fuel circuit portion MWI setpoint and a predetermined independent fuel circuit portion nozzle gas injector pressure ratio.
