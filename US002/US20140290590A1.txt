abstract
    A condensing type hot water boiler comprises: a firebox casing that formulates a firebox in which fuel is combusted; a burner that ignites fuel furnished in the upper part of said firebox casing; a ventilator that supplies air to said firebox; a heat exchange casing, wherein heat is exchanged between hot water and the flame and combustion gas flowing in from said firebox, located at the lower part of said firebox casing; and a hot water coil formed to cover the inner wall of said firebox casing and in which hot water is received in the interior from said heat exchange casing for heat exchange with flame and combustion gas of the interior of said firebox.
