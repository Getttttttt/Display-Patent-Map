abstract
    A control system used in a hybrid vehicle having a drive system including a starter motor, an engine, and a motor/generator, and a power supply system including a high power battery as power supply for the motor/generator, a low power battery as power supply of the vehicle auxiliary equipment, a capacitor as power supply for the starter motor, and a capacitor power supply control unit that controls charging and discharging of the capacitor. The control system includes an auxiliary equipment load power supply system formed by connecting the high power battery and the low power battery via a DC/DC converter, and a starter load power supply system including the capacitor and a capacitor charging circuit controlled by the capacitor power supply control unit, the starter load power supply system being connected to and branching from the DC/DC converter of the auxiliary equipment load power supply system.
