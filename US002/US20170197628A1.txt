abstract
    A system and method for controlling a transmission gear shift in a vehicle having a driveline and an electric motor operable to output torque to the driveline includes applying a negative motor torque to the driveline to reduce driveline oscillations resulting from the transmission gear shift. The negative motor torque is based on vehicle conditions occurring after the transmission gear shift has begun and before the transmission gear shift is complete.
