abstract
    The present invention relates to a supercapacitive storage system (10) for the electricity of a vehicle, characterized in that it comprises a control device (12) arranged to allow charging of capacitive storage elements (11) or the storage system (10) when the voltage of the capacitive storage elements (11) is below or equal to a maximum voltage value of the operating range of a driving and energy recovery system (20), and to prohibit charging of the capacitive storage elements (11) when the voltage of the electricity distribution grid (2) is above a maximum operating voltage value of the capacitive storage elements (11), a driving and energy recovery system (20) and a control method.
