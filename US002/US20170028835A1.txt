abstract
    A vehicle configured to operate independently from fossil fuel power sources. The vehicle includes a battery, a solar cell, and an electric motor operably connected to the internal combustion engine. The vehicle includes multiple supplemental power sources, including wheel induction generators and the inertial generators, configured to recapture of the portion expended to operate the vehicle, reducing the amount of electrical energy required to be generated by the solar cell. Each of the induction generators includes an induction coil and a plurality of magnets positioned about each of the hubs of the wheels. Rotation of the plurality of magnets about the induction coil from when the vehicle is in motion generates an electrical current in the induction coil. The inertial generators can be directly connected to the electric motor or in electrical communication with the battery.
