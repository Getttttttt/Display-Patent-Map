abstract
    An internal combustion engine is powered on or using a mix of a liquid fuel and hydrogen, to produce energy that is converted into electricity using an alternator, which is subsequently used to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen is produced through the use of hydrogen generating cells which breaks down water using electrolysis and outputs hydrogen. The cell uses anode rods inserted into a tank containing cathode tubes. Additionally, the tank itself also acts as the cathode as the tank is connected to the negative end of a circuit. A current passes from the anode rods to the cathode through water to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen is off gassed and stored in a reservoir to be used in an internal combustion engine as fuel. The energy needed to perform electrolysis is garnered from an alternator and a turbine that is part of the system.
