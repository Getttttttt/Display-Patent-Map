abstract
    The invention relates to a waste heat recovery system (1) comprising a working fluid circuit (18), having a heat exchanger which is connected in an exhaust gas line (4) of an internal combustion engine (2). The heat exchanger is part of the working fluid circuit (18) together with an expansion machine (20) which has at least one working fluid bypass (21) that is controlled by a valve. According to the invention, a waste heat recovery system (1) is provided with improved functionality. This is achieved in that the valve is a directional valve which connects a fluid inlet (36) to an expansion machine fluid outlet (37) and/or a bypass fluid outlet (38), in particular a 3/2-way valve (22), and the connection of the fluid inlet (36) to the expansion machine fluid outlet (37) is leakage-free relative to the bypass fluid outlet (38), whereas the connection of the fluid inlet (36) to the bypass fluid outlet (38) exhibits leakages with respect to the expansion machine fluid outlet (37).
