abstract
    The present invention relates to regenerative electric energy wherein the electric motor, gear box and generator are configured to produce a continuous flow of electric energy. The invention relates to the driving members of electricity generation such as nuclear, hydroelectric, thermal plant, and wind power. The one embodiment includes inverter with battery charger, and battery, utilizing as initial start-up to AC load usage of electric motor as driving mechanism of generator, and further embodiment a set of breakers as diverting configuration division members of electricity generation of generator wherein the portion of electric energy is diverted back to inverter with built-in switch that can detect and switch automatically and transfer between inverter power and incoming AC power then activate the system and supply continuous AC power to electric motor as regenerative driving source of generator. Then other portion of the regenerative energy is transmitted to end users of electric energy.
