abstract
    A fossil-fuel power generation system assisted by waste incineration includes a waste incineration subsystem and a fossil-fuel power generation subsystem; wherein: the waste incineration subsystem includes a waste incinerator and the fossil-fuel power generation subsystem includes a main boiler; a flue gas channel is provided between a furnace of the waste incinerator and the main boiler; flue gas generated by waste incineration of the waste incinerator enters the main boiler through the flue gas channel; and the flue gas channel is located in a low part of the main boiler. Based on a high-temperature combustion environment of the main boiler, thermal energy of combustible waste is fully released and a thermal efficiency is increased; moreover, the flue gas discharged by the waste incinerator contains harmful substances which are mostly burned down by a high-temperature incineration of the main boiler. A secondary incineration greatly reduces the harmful substances and protects environment.
