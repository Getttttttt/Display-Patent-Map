abstract
    A method that may include obtaining environmental parameters related to one or more routes of a trip for a first vehicle system, and determining one or more expenditure sections and one or more charging sections of the one or more routes by predicting where the first vehicle system will consume energy and where the first vehicle system will generate the energy, respectively, during the trip based on the environmental parameters. A first trip plan may be obtained for the trip based on the one or more expenditure sections and the one or more charging sections, the trip plan designating one or more operational settings for the first vehicle system for travel during the trip.
