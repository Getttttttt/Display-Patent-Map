abstract
    A valve for controlling a flow of a fluid between a source, reservoir, a vent, and pressure-based device. The valve has multiple positions each having a source port fluidly coupleable to the source, reservoir port fluidly coupleable to the reservoir, device port fluidly coupleable to the pressure-based device, and venting port configured to vent the fluid. The multiple positions are separately selectable and include a fill position having a fill conduit fluidly coupling the source port and device port, a recycle position having a recycle conduit fluidly coupling the reservoir port and device port, and a vent position having a vent conduit fluidly coupling the vent port and device port. The fill conduit, recycle conduit, and vent conduit each communicate the fluid only when a corresponding one of the multiple positions is selected, and the multiple positions are configured to prevent selection of more than one at a time.
