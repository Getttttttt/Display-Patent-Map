abstract
    The present invention provides a process for power recovery in a process for producing ethylene, comprising steam cracking a hydrocarbon feed to produce a cracked gas product; cooling the cracked gas product by indirect heat exchange with high pressure liquid water to obtain cooled cracked gas product while evaporating the high pressure liquid water to high pressure steam; expanding the high pressure steam in a first steam expansion turbine to produce power and to obtain medium pressure steam; heating at least part of the medium pressure steam to increase the temperature of the medium pressure steam by passing the medium pressure steam through a convection zone of the cracking furnace and retrieving reheated medium pressure steam from the convection zone; expanding at least part of the reheated medium pressure steam in a second steam expansion turbine to produce power and to obtain low pressure steam.
