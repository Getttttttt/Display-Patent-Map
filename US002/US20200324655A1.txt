abstract
    A vehicle propulsion system includes a propulsion electrical storage device (PESD), a first switching device, an ancillary electrical storage device (AESD), a second switching device, and a controller. The PESD powers a traction motor of a vehicle via a propulsion circuit. The AESD is a different type of electrical storage device than the PESD and powers the traction motor via an ancillary circuit. The first switching device is electrically connected to the propulsion circuit, and the second switching device is electrically connected to the ancillary circuit. The controller switches or maintains the second switching device in a closed, conducting state during an elevated demand period for the AESD to power to the traction motor. The controller switches the second switching device to an open, non-conducting state prior to switching the first switching device to the closed state for the PESD to power the traction motor.
