abstract
    A vehicle and method is provided. The vehicle includes systems and method for limiting the slip of the wheels. In an embodiment, the system holds the brakes based on an acceleration characteristic measured by a sensor. In another embodiment, the system includes a transmission controller that applies an adjustment to limit an amount of clutch slip as the clutch temperature to change in clutch performance to reduce wheel slip. In another embodiment, the system monitors wheel slip signal from a sensor and compares the wheel slip to a target slip value and controls clutch slip of the transmission clutch based to maintain engine output torque during acceleration. In another embodiment, in response to an anticipated vehicle launch event, a drive motor applies a first torque to the input shaft to adjust a gear lash of the differential unit.
