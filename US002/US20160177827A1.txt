abstract
    A gas turbine power plant includes a gas turbine having a compressor, combustion chamber, and expander and is rotationally mechanically coupled to an energisation unit designed for motor operation of the compressor and for electricity-generating generator operation of the gas turbine. The power plant includes a recuperator, thermally connected to an exhaust-gas discharge line of the turbine such that heat is transferred from the exhaust-gas flow in the exhaust-gas discharge line to a fluid flow in a fluid line during operation, which fluid flow is fed to the combustion chamber. A supply line is fluidically connected to the turbine such that water is supplied to the turbine to increase operating mass flow during operation. The exhaust-gas discharge line is thermally coupled to at least one heat accumulator, such that, during operation, heat of the exhaust-gas flow is transferred to a heat accumulator medium for storage in the heat accumulator.
