abstract
    Systems, methods, and vehicles for use with internal combustion engines comprising combustion chambers that produce exhaust gases that include a Stirling engine having a hot side and a cold side with the hot side being in thermal contact with exhaust gases produced by the internal combustion engine. The Stirling engine is configured to be powered by heat from the exhaust gases during operation of the internal combustion engine, and a compressor powered by the Stirling engine is configured to provide compressed air to combustion chambers of the internal combustion engine.
