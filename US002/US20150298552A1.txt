abstract
    The regenerative energy produced during the braking of a vehicle is used for powering a secondary battery, that is independent from the main battery, and, in the event of a complete failure of said main battery, allows the continued operation of the basic services such as power steering, lights, the brake servo unit, and electronics, as a result of the combined action of said autonomous system that includes a capacitor bank which powers said services either directly or via the secondary battery. The system comprises an interface of the electronic power and control unit, an electronic power and control unit, applied to the steering and pedals, and an ECU power controller and port.
