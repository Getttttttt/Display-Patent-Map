abstract
    In a method a combined heat and power plant produced gaseous medium, whether it be synthesis gas or internal combustion engine's exhaust gas, is used for electricity production or its contained heat energy is recovered to be used e.g. for house heating, comprises method steps of separating a first gas portion and a second gas portion from the gaseous medium. This enables to change the ratio of the produced heat and power in multiple ways. The combined heat and power plant in the method comprises a valve configured to separate the gaseous medium into a first gas portion and into a second gas portion.
