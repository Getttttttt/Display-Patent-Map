abstract
    Auxiliary energy regeneration system for motorvehicles (7) propelled by an electric, or electro-thermal hybrid propeller, equipped with MGU-K motor generator units (13), and possibly also of MGU-H units, characterised in that: Said auxiliary energy regeneration system consists of an aerogenerator system (A) arranged on said motorvehicle (7) in at least one dynamic air intake (8), or air duct, and comprising one or a group of wind turbines (1) electrically connected to one or a group of batteries (6) dedicated to the operation of said MGU- K unit (13), and possibly also of said MGU-H unit, wherein said aerogenerator system (A) is controlled by a control and electronic management unit (4) to actively cooperate in parallel with said MGU-K unit (13), and possibly also with said MGU-H unit, in order to reduce the charging time of the group of batteries (6), increasing the performance of the electric propeller or of the electro-thermal hybrid propeller of said motorvehicle (7).
