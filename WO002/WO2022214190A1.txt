abstract
    A method for adapting air resistance of a heavy-duty vehicle (100). The vehicle comprises at least one electric machine (111, 121, 131) arranged for regenerative braking, one or more energy absorption devices (140) arranged to receive energy from the at least one electrical machine during regenerative braking, and a variable air resistance arrangement (210, 220, 230) arranged to provide a range of different air resistances of the vehicle. The method comprises: obtaining (S1) a current energy absorption capability of the one or more energy absorption devices (140); obtaining (S3) an expected energy generation from regenerative braking during a planned route of the vehicle and during a nominal value of air resistance of the vehicle (100); determining (S4) a desired air resistance of the vehicle (100) from the range of different air resistances of the vehicle based on the current energy absorption capability and the expected energy generation; and adapting (S5) the variable air resistance arrangement (210, 220, 230) according to the desired air resistance.
