abstract
    There is provided a method and a system to adaptively control a vehicle inverter system that is operable to power a vehicle powertrain, wherein the vehicle powertrain comprises a plurality of operating modes. The method and system comprises adaptively controlling the AC power output of the vehicle inverter system to vary the AC power output of the vehicle inverter system for the vehicle powertrain according to each operating mode of the vehicle powertrain. The method and system further comprises identifying the operating mode of the vehicle powertrain in real-time and adaptively controlling the AC power output of the vehicle inverter system according to the identified real-time operating mode of the vehicle powertrain.
