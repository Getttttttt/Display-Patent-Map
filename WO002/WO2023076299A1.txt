abstract
    A power plant system is disclosed. The power plant system includes a combustor, a turbine configured to generate electricity, a carbon capture system configured to remove at least a portion of carbon-based gasses from the flue gas downstream from the combustor, and a thermal storage system including a hot storage unit configured to store heat generated at least by resistively-heated gas at a hot temperature, the hot temperature greater than ambient temperature. The power plant is configured to operate in at least a first mode for storing thermal energy in the thermal storage system and a second mode for releasing the stored thermal energy from the thermal storage system and during the second mode, heat stored in the hot storage unit is transferred to the carbon capture system.
