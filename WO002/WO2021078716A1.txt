abstract
    The present invention relates to electromechanical brake technology, and more particularly to an electromechanical brake system. The electromechanical brake system comprises a capacitor- based power source and at least one electric brake device. The electric brake device comprises a motor that acquires electric power from the capacitor-based power source via a power supply main circuit to generate a braking force. The electromechanical brake system further comprises an energy recycling circuit connected in parallel to the power supply main circuit. The energy recycling circuit comprises a unidirectional conduction element and/or a voltage regulating element. When the brake force is reduced or the brake is at least partially released in response to a braking demand, the motor generates energy which is returned to the capacitor-based power source via the energy recycling circuit. The present invention may avoid an accumulation of a back electromotive force generated when the motor rotates in a reverse direction, thereby avoiding a hidden danger of circuit overvoltage damage and reducing energy consumption of the electromechanical brake system.
