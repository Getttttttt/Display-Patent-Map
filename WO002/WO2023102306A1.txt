abstract
    A kinetic energy recovery apparatus for use in powered vehicles can connect to the axle of the car or similar vehicle. As the vehicle moves forward, the kinetic energy from the forward spin of the axle is transformed into electricity by the apparatus. A belt connected to the device transfers the energy from the spinning axle to a generator, which generates electricity which is then stored in a battery.
