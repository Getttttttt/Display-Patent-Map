abstract
    An electrically controlled valve which can be operated using a programable controller. A cooperating pair of the electrically controlled valves can be used in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO). The electrically controlled valve has two seats, and a blade which can move between a first position contacting the first seat and a second position contacting the second seat. The blade is moved by an actuator which is controlled by a variable frequency drive (VFD). A control computer continuously monitors the operation of both valves and halts operation of the system upon detecting a fault (error). The motion of the blade is programmed such that force of impact on the seat is reduced. Once the blade is seated, a brake is engaged which maintains the stationary position while utilizing relatively low power.
