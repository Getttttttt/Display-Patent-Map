abstract
    An electric or hybrid electric-endothermic traction system comprises an electric machine (2), an inverter (5), a battery pack (Batt), and a switching device (4) associated with the electric machine (2) and configured to switch it between a low-speed configuration, in which the stator windings (3) assume a first electric configuration, and a high-speed configuration, in which the stator windings (3) assume a second electric configuration, wherein the first electric configuration of the stator windings (3) results in a voltage induced by the rotation of the rotor (BEMF1 ) that, on reaching a pre-determined threshold value (ω_th) of the angular velocity of the rotor (2b), exceeds a supply voltage of the battery pack (V_batt), whereas the second electric configuration of the stator windings (3) results in a voltage induced by the rotation of the rotor (BEMF2) that is lower than the voltage of the battery pack (V_batt) for any angular velocity within a range of use of the electric machine (2). An emergency device (7) is connected to the switching device (4), control unit (6) and/or inverter (5) and is configured to send to the switching device (4) a signal (S2) representing a switching of the stator (2a) from the low-speed configuration to the high-speed configuration, if said stator is in the low-speed configuration, or a disabling of the switching device (4), if said stator is in the high-speed configuration.
