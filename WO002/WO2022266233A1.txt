abstract
    Systems, apparatuses, and methods for controlling a transmission and other vehicle systems and components based on operation of an auxiliary braking system for a vehicle are disclosed. A controller for a vehicle includes a processing circuit having at least one memory device coupled to at least one processor, the at least one memory device is configured to store instructions thereon that, when executed by the at least one processors, cause the at least one processor to: receive data regarding operation of an auxiliary brake system of the vehicle; determine an auxiliary brake fault condition based on the received data regarding operation of the auxiliary brake system; determine that the vehicle is on or is about to experience a negative road grade; determine a vehicle speed is greater than a requested vehicle speed for the negative road grade; and control a transmission to downshift at least two settings relative to a current transmission setting.
