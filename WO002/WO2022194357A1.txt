abstract
    A vehicle unit (110, 120) comprising a vehicle control unit, VCU, (130, 140) an electrical energy storage system (EESS), (135, 150), and at least one electric machine (136, 160, 170, 180) arranged for regenerative braking, wherein the electric machine generates an electrical output current during regenerative braking, wherein the control unit (130, 140) is arranged to obtain a desired energy absorption capability value of the vehicle unit (110, 120) and to control an energy dissipation from the EESS (135, 150) to maintain an energy absorption capability of the EESS (135, 150) above the desired energy absorption capability value.
