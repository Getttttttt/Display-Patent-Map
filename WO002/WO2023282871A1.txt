abstract
    The present invention relates to an energy production system (10) for providing production of energy from the waste heat depending on the pressure difference in at least one pressure changing unit (100) which balances the pressure of a fluid (20) which moves, in order to receive the waste heat which occurs as a result of operation of a vehicle motor (30) and in order to use said waste heat in a cooling cycle. Accordingly, the subject matter energy production system (10) comprises at least one movement provider (110) which at least partially moves for providing balancing of the pressure of said fluid (20) and at least one part of which is made of conductor material, and at least one magnetic field generator (200) where the movement provider (110) stays inside the magnetic field for providing production of energy depending on the movement of said movement provider (110).
