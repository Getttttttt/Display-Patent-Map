abstract
    The present invention relates to a process and plant (1) for converting thermal energy into electrical and/or mechanical energy. The plant includes a closed circuit (2), a pump (13) to circulate the working fluid in the closed circuit (2), an evaporator (3) to heat the working fluid to cause it to change from a liquid to a gaseous state, a volumetric expander (4) operating in the closed circuit (2) downstream of the evaporator (3) and configured to receive working as an input fluid in the gaseous state, a condenser (16) operating on the closed circuit (2) downstream of the volumetric expander (4) and upstream of the pump (13) to condense the working fluid determining its transition from the gaseous to the liquid state. The pump (13) in turn comprises a first compartment positionable in fluid communication with a first portion (2a) of the closed circuit (2), extending downstream of the pump (13) and upstream of the evaporator (3), to send working fluid in the liquid state to the same evaporator (3), and a second compartment that may be positioned in fluid communication with a second portion (2b) of the closed circuit, extending upstream of the volumetric expander (4) and downstream of said first portion (2a), to receive working fluid in the gaseous state generated by the evaporator (3). The working fluid in the gaseous state expands the second compartment and causes a volume reduction of the first compartment by promoting the pumping of the working fluid in the liquid state to the evaporator (3).
