abstract
    A method (900) for controlling the wheel slip with mixing of the dissipative braking torque and the regenerative braking torque in a braking system with Brake-by-Wire, B-b-W, technology of a vehicle, comprising steps of: - receiving (901), by a wheel slip control sub-module of a wheel slip main control module with mixing of the dissipative braking torque and the regenerative braking torque of an electronic control unit of a braking system of a vehicle, a first plurality of input information for controlling wheel slip, hereinafter also simply first plurality of input information; - determining (902), by the wheel slip control sub-module, a braking torque request to be applied to a corner of the vehicle and a braking torque control component, based on the first plurality of input information received; - providing (903), by the wheel slip control sub-module, the braking torque request to be applied to a corner of the vehicle, the determined braking torque control component, and an enabled wheel slip control confirmation value, to a braking regeneration sub-module of the generative wheel slip control module of the electronic control unit of the braking system of the vehicle; - receiving (904), by the braking regeneration sub-module, a second plurality of input information for controlling the wheel slip; - determining (905), by the braking regeneration sub-module, a regenerative braking torque command as a function of the braking torque request to be applied to the corner of the vehicle or of the braking torque control component, based on a status of an input enabling signal, and as a function of the second plurality of input information and of the enabled wheel slip control confirmation value received from the wheel slip control sub-module, if the enabling input status is disabled, the step of determining (905) is performed by the braking regeneration sub-module to obtain the regenerative braking torque command as a function of the braking torque request, if the enabling input status is enabled, the step of determining (905) is performed by the braking regeneration sub-module to obtain the regenerative braking torque command as a function of the braking torque control component; - determining (906), by the braking regeneration sub-module, a dissipative braking torque command as a function of the braking torque request and of the regenerative braking torque command determined by the braking regeneration sub-module.
