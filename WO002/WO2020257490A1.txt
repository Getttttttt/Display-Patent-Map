abstract
    A powered weight distribution system is provided for a vehicle having a platform on which a load is supported. The powered weight distribution system includes a shiftable axle assembly. The shiftable axle assembly includes a drivable axle and a frame supporting the drivable axle. The frame is configured to be supported on the platform. The frame is switchable between a locked configuration in which the frame is fixed relative to the platform and an unlocked configuration in which the frame is shiftable relative to the platform. The shiftable axle assembly further includes a powering element configured to rotatably drive the drivable axle, such that the frame and the drivable axle shift relative to the platform when the frame is in the unlocked configuration and the drivable axle is rotated by the powering element.
