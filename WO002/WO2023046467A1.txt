abstract
    Water heater (10) comprising a gas burner (11) being configured to combust gas if a heat demand is present, namely if heated water is requested by at least one water consumer (24), further comprising a heat exchanger (17) being configured to heat water using the thermal energy provided with the combustion of the gas, wherein the heat exchanger is a condensing heat exchanger, further comprising an input pipe (18) being configured to provide water to be heated to the heat exchanger (17), further comprising an output pipe (19) being configured to provide water heated by the heat exchanger (17) to the at least one water consumer (24), further comprising a siphon or trap (22) being configured to collect condensate resulting at the condensing heat exchanger (17) during operation of the water heater (10), further comprising a first connection pipe (21) and a valve (23) acting together with the first connection pipe (21), both the first connection pipe (21) and the valve (23) being configured to guide water heated by heat exchanger (17) from the output pipe (19) to the siphon or trap (22), and/or to guide water not heated by the heat exchanger (17) from the output pipe (19) to the siphon or trap (22).
