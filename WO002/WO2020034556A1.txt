abstract
    Provided herein are systems and methods of automatic off-throttle regenerative braking in electric vehicles. One or more sensors disposed in an electric vehicle can acquire one or more sensor signals indicative of one or more respective driving parameters of the electric vehicle. A data processing system of the electric vehicle can determine, using the one or more sensor signals, one or more current driving conditions of the electric vehicle. The data processing system of the electric vehicle can determine, using the one or more current driving conditions, a future driving state indicative of an imminent future slowdown event. The data processing system of the electric vehicle can cause a regenerative braking system of the electric vehicle to apply regenerative braking, responsive to determining the future driving state.
