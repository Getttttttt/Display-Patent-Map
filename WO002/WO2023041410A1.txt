abstract
    The invention relates to a system for extraction of hot combustion gas to supply heat for separate use, said hot combustion gas extracted from a preheater(1) of a clinker burning department in a plant for manufacture of cement clinker, said plant comprising a preheater(1), a rotary kiln(3), a clinker cooler(4), said preheater(1) comprising two or more cyclone stages,where the hot combustion gas is extracted from one or more locations between a rotary kiln gas outlet(32) and an exhaust gas outlet stage cyclone(1a) of the preheater(1), said plant being connected to a separate use application which is a heat consuming process or plant which can receive a heat input as hot combustion gas from said clinker burning department, wherein the extraction of hot combustion gas utilizes a heat transformation effect of the preheater(1).
