abstract
    A fuel cell power module powers an autonomous electric train. The fuel cell power module is located in one or more locomotives of the train. A locomotive may also have one or more of hydrogen storage, a traction motor, and a battery. The train also has a plurality of coaches each containing a traction motor, and optionally also a battery. The coaches do not have fuel cell power modules or other fuel based sources of energy. The traction motors in the coaches receive electrical power from the fuel cell power module in the locomotive. Energy is recovered by regenerative breaking in the coaches and stored in batteries in the coaches or the locomotive or both. The train can be operated independent of a catenary system.
