abstract
    The present invention relates to a cooling arrangement for a hybrid vehicle (1) comprising an electric drive unit (2), a combustion engine (3) and a WHR system (4), wherein the cooling arrangement comprises a cooler package (5) arranged in an air flow passage (6) of the hybrid vehicle (1).The cooler package (5) comprises a first radiator (r1) which is primarily used to cool coolant for cooling of an energy storage (2b) of the electric drive unit (2), a second radiator (r2) which is primarily used to cool coolant for cooling of cooling power electronics (2c) of the electric drive unit (2), a third radiator (r3) which is primarily used to cool coolant for cooling of a condenser (4a) of the WHR system (4) and a fourth radiator (r4) which is used to cool coolant for cooling of the combustion engine (3). The first radiator (r1) and the second radiator (r2) are arranged in positions upstream of the third radiator (r3) and the fourth radiator (r4) in view of the intended flow direction of a cooling air flow (7) through the air flow passage (6).
