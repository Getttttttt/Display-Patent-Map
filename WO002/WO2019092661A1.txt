abstract
    An electric propulsion motor (52) power-assisted bicycle is described. To improve the performance, the bicycle comprises a manually operable brake (20) to brake the bicycle, a position sensor (32) for detecting the, e.g. angular, position of the brake, and an electronic board (50) programmed to detect said position by the sensor and to control the power delivered by the electric motor as a function of said position.
