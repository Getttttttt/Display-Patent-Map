abstract
    A modular heat recovery steam generator (mHRSG) comprises a first boiler module comprising a plurality of pipes having at least one pipe with a flanged end; a first piping deck comprising a plurality of pipes having at least one pipe with a flanged end, wherein the pipe with the flanged end is secured to the pipe with the flanged end of the first boiler module using bolts; a second boiler module comprising a plurality of pipes having at least one pipe with a flanged end; a second piping deck comprising a plurality of pipes having at least one pipe with a flanged end, wherein the pipe with the flanged end is secured to the pipe with the flanged end of the second boiler module using bolts; and a main stack. The first boiler module is operatively coupled to the second boiler module and the second boiler module is operatively coupled to the main stack.
