abstract
    Hybrid wayside energy recovery systems are described. The system includes a wayside energy transmission system coupled to a utility electrical grid and coupled to a traction power distribution network of a railway system on which rail vehicles operate. The wayside energy transmission system is configured to transmit energy recovered from the traction power distribution network to the utility electrical grid. The system includes a wayside storage system coupled to the railway system. The wayside energy storage system is configured to store energy recovered from the traction power distribution network. A controller is coupled to the traction power distribution network, the wayside energy transmission and to the wayside energy storage system. The controller is configured to receive positional information about a rail vehicle on the traction power distribution network and transfer at least a portion of energy recovered from the rail vehicle to either the wayside energy transmission system for transmission to the utility electrical grid or to the wayside storage system for storage based, in part, on the positional information about the rail vehicle.
