abstract
    The present invention relates to a steel making plant (1) comprising at least one electric arc furnace (10) and a fume collection and treatment system (100) comprising: a first primary suction line (110) fluidically connected to the electric arc furnace (10) to suck the fumes generated in said electric arc furnace (10); a secondary suction line (120) suitable for ventilating the environment surrounding the electric arc furnace (10) by means of at least one suction hood (121); and at least one filtration apparatus (130) suitable for filtering the emissions collected by said fume collection and treatment system (100) before they are discharged into the atmosphere. The electric arc furnace (10) is powered by a continuous charging system (11). A fume cooling apparatus (111), a dust collecting device (112) and a denox selective catalytic reduction apparatus (113) are arranged in sequence along said first primary suction line (110), starting from the electric arc furnace (10). The secondary suction line (120) flows into the first primary suction line (110) downstream of the denox selective catalytic reduction apparatus (113) and upstream of said at least one filtration apparatus (130).
