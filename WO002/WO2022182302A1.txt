abstract
    The present invention is a heat exchanger which comprises a body comprising a gas inlet hole or burner and a gas outlet (discharge) thereon and a preferably helical pipe located inside the said body; and comprises at least one plate assembly (1) which enables the gas pressure drop to be kept at minimum level by means of directing the burnt gas homogenously and comprises a plate body (2) which partially or completely covers the burnt gas outlet hole, and which is comprised of at least one opening (3) in the form of a hole provided on the said plate body (2) and enabling the burnt has in the heat exchanger to reach the chimney by passing therethrough.
