abstract
    The present invention is directed to a system (100) for selectively operating regenerative braking in a vehicle. The system (100) includes a user-operable input device (110) for selecting a regenerative mode, a motor (120) for driving the vehicle, and a controller (130) coupled with the motor (120) and the user-operable input device (110). The controller (130) is configured to: receive an input signal corresponding to the regenerative mode selected by a user; receive a vehicle parameter; and enable or disable the regenerative braking for controlling operation of the motor (120) based on the regenerative mode selected by the user and the vehicle parameter.
