abstract
    A wheel module (300) arranged to generate torque (M) to accelerate and to decelerate a heavy-duty vehicle (100). The wheel module (300) comprises at least one electric machine (310) arranged for regenerative braking, an eddy current braking device (320), and an electronic control unit, ECU, (330). The wheel module (300) further comprises a communications port (350) arranged for communication with an external control unit (101) and a power distribution network (340) arranged to connect the electric machine (310) to the eddy current braking device (320) and to a power port (360) arranged to input and to output electrical power to and from the wheel module (300). The ECU (330) is arranged to obtain configuration data via the communications port (350) indicative of a maximum output power of the power port (360), and to control the power distribution network (340) to maintain the output power of the power port (360) below the maximum output power by distributing power from the at least one electric machine (310) between the eddy current braking device (320) and the power port (360).
