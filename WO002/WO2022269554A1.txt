abstract
    The present invention relates to a process of cogeneration of electrical energy and heat starting from biomass (6) in a micro-cogenerator (1), said process comprising: i) feeding the biomass (6) to a pyrolytic gasifier (2) where it reacts thus generating syngas (8); ii) feeding the syngas (8) to a burner (3) where it is burned thus generating combustion gases (32); iii) subjecting the combustion gases (32) to heat exchange in the hot exchanger of a Stirling engine (4), with exhaust fumes (34) being obtained, during said step ii) the air-syngas ratio is adjusted based on a signal provided by a lambda probe (57) crossed by a flow of said exhaust fumes (34), said process comprising a start-up phase the micro-cogenerator (1) which comprises, in turn, a step a) of detecting the presence of syngas (8) inside the burner (3) and a subsequent step b) of ignition of the burner (3), wherein: said first step a) comprises calculating the integral over time of the temperature of the reaction chamber (17) of the pyrolytic gasifier (2) and calculating the integral over time of the value read by said lambda probe (57), during said step a) the value of the integral over time of the temperature is compared with a preset threshold value of said integral and, when said threshold value is exceeded, the value of the integral over time of the value read by the lambda probe (57) is, in turn, compared with a corresponding threshold value until it is exceeded, said second step b) is started when the latter threshold value is exceeded.
