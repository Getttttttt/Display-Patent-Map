abstract
    The present invention provides a waste-heat recovery and power generation system for liquid-cooled data centres and computing centres, to capture and use their waste heat and use it to produce electricity, allowing the data centres and computing centres to self-supply a part of their electrical needs in a cost-effective manner. The system uses heat collected from the electronic components to heat and vaporize a working fluid; uses the vaporized working fluid(s) to power an expander; uses the expander to drive an electric generator; uses a condenser to condense the partially cooled vapour expelled from the expander; uses a pump to return the condensed working fluid to the evaporator system; and uses a control system to manage the valves of the heat-capture system and the expander, and to manage the generation system order to maximize efficiency and power quality.
