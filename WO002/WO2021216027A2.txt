abstract
    The present invention relates to systems and devices in which water or energy is produced, in order to provide new generation water and electricity generation and heating cooling system, and device through which clean water can be obtained from the humidity of the air, can also be used for electricity generation, while meeting the clean water and energy requirement while also meeting the need for heating and cooling, characterized by comprising; at least one condenser unit (1) that transfers the humidity absorbed in the air to the liquid-water phase with the humid air inlet (18) pressed into the media cassettes (21) consisting of salts and into it by means of the fan (20), at least one media recycling (2), where the obtained atmospheric water is sent to the evaporation unit (3) and at the same time recycles the media that transforms into solid phase to the media, cassettes (21), at least one evaporation unit (3) where the hot liquid coming from solar parabolic units (4) or solar panels by means of solar energy evaporates atmospheric water and separates the same from the media, at least one steam turbine unit (5) in the evaporation unit (3) to which the steam obtained at a certain temperature is sent and which will be used in electricity generation, at least one control unit (24) that allows for using the absorbed atmospheric air as a cooler, condensing the obtained atmospheric water vapor with heat pump technology, provides ambient air conditioning with heat pump waste heat and directs processes of water production, energy generation, heating, cooling air conditioning by controlling the entire system.
