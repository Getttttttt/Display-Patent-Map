abstract
    A new thermal system utilizing removable heat pump modules to decrease servicing time and complexity increase the range of refrigerants safely usable increase the efficiency of many thermal systems and serve new industrial thermal needs. Safe use of potentially toxic and flammable refrigerants is enabled by enclosing the heat pump modules within a hermetic enclosure with multiple overpressure safeties employed, The tool necessary for servicing these thermal systems without any refrigerant leakage is included.
