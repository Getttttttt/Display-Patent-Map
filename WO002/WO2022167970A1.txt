abstract
    A method of extracting lithium from a raw material mixture, comprising the steps of introducing a raw material mixture into a rotary kiln, subjecting the raw material mixture to a thermal treatment in the rotary kiln for melting the raw material mixture and to form alkali metal chlorides in gaseous form, maintaining the melt at a temperature of > 1150Â°C to allow the melt to flow to a kiln outlet of the rotary kiln, drawing off the exhaust gas together with kiln dust and the gaseous alkali metal chlorides, quenching the exhaust gas together with the kiln dust and the gaseous alkali metal chlorides thereby condensing the alkali metal chlorides on the surface of the kiln dust, separating the condensed alkali metal chlorides from the exhaust gas, mixing the condensed alkali metal chlorides with water to obtain an aqueous solution of alkali metal chlorides, and separating the aqueous solution of alkali metal chlorides from the kiln dust.
