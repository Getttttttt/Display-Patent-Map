abstract
    Method and system for controlling the humidity in an enclosure that has a humidity source such as a greenhouse. The system includes a refrigeration type dehumidifier having an air-to-air heat exchanger coupled to the evaporator. Air from within the enclosure flows through the air-to-air heat exchanger before and after it comes in contact with the evaporator, and the air that is exhausted from the condenser is expelled outside the enclosure. The water that is generated from condensation of humidity of the air within the enclosure is collected and dispensed to replenish water to the humidity source for example by irrigation of plants in a greenhouse. Hygrometers may be coupled to the system to indicate when dehumidification and/or irrigation is required.
