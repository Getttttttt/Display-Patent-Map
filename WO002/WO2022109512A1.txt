abstract
    The present disclosure presents improved combustion turbine engine systems and related methods. One such system includes a turbine system comprising a high pressure compressor, a high pressure turbine, a combustor, and a recuperator. The system further includes a turbocharger system comprising a low pressure compressor and a low pressure turbine; an air cooler device that is configured to cool intake air output to the low pressure compressor; and a refrigeration system comprising a hot gas heat exchanger and a cold gas heat exchanger, wherein the refrigeration system receives combustion products from the turbine system and compressed air from the turbocharger system. The refrigeration system cools the combustion products and the compressed air to generate a cooled combustion product mixture that is provided to the turbine system, and the refrigeration system further generates steam that is provided to the turbine system. Other systems and methods are also presented.
