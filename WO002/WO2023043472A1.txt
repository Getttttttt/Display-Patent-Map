abstract
    A lift device and a method of controlling the lift device are provided. The lift device has a lifting mechanism supporting a lifting platform relative to the chassis. An electric motor is drivingly coupled to a traction device, and a traction battery is in electrical communication with the electric motor. A user input is provided to control a speed of the lift device by inputting a requested speed. A controller is configured to, in response to the lift device being on a non-zero grade and if the requested speed is greater than a predetermined speed, command the electric motor to output a braking torque and provide electrical power to the traction battery, and limit the speed of the lift device to the predetermined speed.
