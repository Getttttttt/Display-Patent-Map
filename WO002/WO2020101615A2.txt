abstract
    It starts combustion by taking atmosphere temperature as the basis; automatically defines combustion time and circulation water pump waiting time by taking atmosphere temperature as the basis; during combustion, the start/ stop combi boiler (4) modulates flame height, fan speed and pump speed based on the set climatic program and atmosphere temperature, to keep under control the amount of energy to be sent to radiators; while energy is sent to radiators by the mainboard, it also measures return water temperature, temperature of water sent to radiators by use of temperature sensors (29); it measures the amount of water passing through the combi boiler by use of a flow sensor (40) to keep under control the amount of energy generated; in lower atmosphere temperatures, it increases the amount of energy generated based on the climatic program set; return water is cooled down by a dedicated heat exchanger (18) by use of the fresh air taken in the combi boiler; return water arrives the combustion chamber in low temperature and the start/ stop combi boiler is constantly operated in high efficiency; even if the temperature of water sent to radiators by the start/ stop combi boiler (4) is increased in cold weather, there is nearly no efficiency loss; one of the most important features of the start/ stop combi boiler (4) is the flue used; the hermetic core flue (1) developed by us is an important feature of this combi boiler, thanks to which the thermal energy in the discharge air is transferred to fresh air taken in the combi boiler; in order to keep discharge air temperature under zero Celsius degree and obtain high level of efficiency, some models are equipped with a compressor (32); the compressor (32) reduces the temperature of discharge air by use of a cooling evaporator (35) to obtain high level of efficiency; since the compressor (32) is not switched on when utility water is demanded from the start/ stop combi boiler (4), the Hamita device has been developed.
