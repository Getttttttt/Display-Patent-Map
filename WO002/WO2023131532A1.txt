abstract
    The invention relates to a heat exchanger apparatus for temperature regulation in a building. The apparatus has an inlet section (2) with a wedge-shaped inlet channel having a wide opening at an air inlet and a gradually narrowing cross-section, and wherein the inlet channel has a side-opening towards a heat exchange section (4). The heat exchange section has plate-shaped phase change material (PCM) modules (8) mounted in an inclined stacked formation forming a series of air channels (40) between the PCM modules extending from the inlet section to the wedge-shaped outlet section (6) so that the airflow is gradually redirected from the inlet section and into the air channels of the heat exchange section. The heat exchanger with PCM plate modules has a low pressure drop meaning low additional energy consumption, and the heat exchanger has a very even airflow offering a system that provides effective cooling until all energy stored in the PCM plate modules is dispatched.
