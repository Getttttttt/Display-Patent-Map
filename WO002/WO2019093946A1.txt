abstract
    Air heat exchanging system (10), for instance for installation in an older natural ventilation house, the system comprising at least two supply air ducts (11, 12) each one of which provided with a respective inlet (21, 22), each supply air duct (11, 12) being situated either inside an exhaust-air duct (13) common to at least two supply air ducts (11, 12) and/or inside an exhaust-air duct (14) separate for each supply air duct (11, 12). The inlet (21, 22) of each supply air duct (11, 12) is connected to a common supply air distributor (31 ), which in turn is connected to an outlet (42) for supply air (1) in a secondary heat exchanger (SHX). Furthermore, the secondary heat exchanger (SHX) is provided with an inlet (41) for supply air (1) and with an inlet (43) and an outlet (44) for exhaust air (2). In the secondary heat exchanger (SHX), supply air (1) is heated by exhaust air (2) which is led out from the system through exhaust air devices (52).
