abstract
    Systems, circuits, and methods are disclosed herein for charging (recharging) one or more batteries of an electric vehicle through an on-board charge shaping (or tuning) circuit. The charge shaping circuit may alter the charge signal received from a charging station and/or a regenerative charge signal from the vehicle motor based on one or more charge conditions at the battery. The shaped charge signal as controlled by the charge shaping circuit may improve one or more aspects of charging of the vehicle battery. The charge shaping circuit and/or a motor controller/inverter of the electric vehicle may include circuitry that is controllable to generate a shaped power signal in a similar manner as above, with or without the charge shaping circuit discussed above. In some implementations, one or more heat transfer systems may be included to transfer heat generated from the battery charging system to the battery.
