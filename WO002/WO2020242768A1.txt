abstract
    A waste heat recovery (WHR) system that can be utilized in internal combustion engine systems includes at least two circuits, one having a low pressure working fluid and another having a high pressure working fluid. Each circuit can include heat exchangers to allow the working fluid to absorb heat form one or more heat source fluids associated with the engine. The system can also include an expander configured to receive the working fluid from the at least two circuits, and generating mechanical power. The system also can include a condenser, a sub cooler, and at least one working fluid pump to pump the working fluid in the at least two circuits. The cooling system also includes a controller that can receive temperature and pressure values from various locations in the WHR system and control at least the flow rates of the working fluids in the at least two circuits.
