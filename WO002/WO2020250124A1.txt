abstract
    The present invention relates to a regenerative active hydraulic system for a vehicle (100), said system comprising: - a motor (140) for driving said vehicle (100), - transmission means (130) operationally connected to at least one wheel (105) of said vehicle (100), said transmission means (130) being adapted to transmit mechanical power from said motor (140) to said at least one wheel (105), - an energy accumulator (240) adapted to store and release a pressurized fluid, - a reversible hydraulic machine (250) operationally coupled to said transmission means (130), said reversible hydraulic machine (250) being in communication of said fluid with said energy accumulator (240), said regenerative active hydraulic system being configured in a manner such that, during a braking phase of said vehicle (100), said reversible hydraulic machine (250) retards said at least one wheel (105) of said vehicle (100) by pumping said fluid into said energy accumulator (240), or in a manner such that, during a driving phase of said vehicle (100), said reversible hydraulic machine (250) supplies supplementary power to said at least one wheel (105) of said vehicle (100) by using said pressurized fluid stored in said energy accumulator (240), wherein said regenerative active hydraulic system comprises at least one active hydraulic device (290) adapted to pump said fluid towards said reversible hydraulic machine (250) and said energy accumulator (240).
