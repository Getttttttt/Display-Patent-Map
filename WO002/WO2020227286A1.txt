abstract
    A brake system of a vehicle is disclosed. The braking system includes: a sensor configured to transmit a signal; a brake control unit (BCU) connected to the sensor and configured to determining a braking torque in response to the received signal; an electric motor connected to the BCU and configured to generate the braking torque; a braking mechanism connected to the electric motor to produce an braking effect from the braking torque; and a transmission situated between the braking mechanism and the wheel and configured to amplify the braking effect.
