abstract
    Disclosed herein is an apparatus for combusting recyclable or waste material. The apparatus (10) comprises a cylindrical combustion chamber (20), the chamber (20) comprises a first inlet (30) in a side wall, the first inlet in communication with a blower (32), an ignition means (34), and a source of recyclable or waste material (42), and an outlet (50) in a first end wall (24) on a longitudinal central axis of the chamber. The longitudinal axis of the first inlet (30) is offset from the central axis of the chamber (20), the first inlet (30) is proximal the first end wall (24) and the outlet (50) comprises a portion which extends inwards of the first end wall (24) a distance greater than the distance between the first inlet (30) and the first end wall (24).
