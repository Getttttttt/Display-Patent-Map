abstract
    The present invention relates to an energy management system, comprising an electric machine electrically connected to an electric source, an air compressor arranged in an air flow channel of the thermal management system, the air compressor being configured to receive and pressurize air, wherein the air compressor is mechanically connected to, and operable by, the electric machine, an air heating arrangement positioned in the air flow channel in fluid communication with the air compressor, wherein the air heating arrangement is arranged to heat air present in the air flow channel, and a flow injecting arrangement positioned downstream the air compressor in the air flow channel, wherein the flow injecting arrangement comprises a portion configured to admit a flow of fluid into the flow of air exhausted from the air compressor.
