abstract
    A method and kiln for the thermal treatment (in particular for the firing) of basic ceramic articles (BC); the kiln (4) comprises a conveying device for conveying the basic ceramic articles (BC) along a given path (P) through a firing chamber (6), in the area of which the basic ceramic articles (BC) are heated; compounds (in particular organic compounds) evaporated from the basic ceramic articles (BC) are removed in the form of gas from the chamber (6), condensed in a water-containing fluid (22) and separated following flocculation so as to obtain a treated liquid (25); said treated liquid (25) is basified and recycled to obtain the water-containing fluid.
