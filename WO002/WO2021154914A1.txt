abstract
    An electrical regeneration and vehicle deceleration control method comprises operating an electrified powertrain in normal or maximum regeneration modes associated with lesser and greater electrical regeneration and vehicle deceleration rates, respectively, receiving an input from a driver of the vehicle indicative of a request to enable the maximum regeneration mode, detecting a status indicative of an availability of the maximum regeneration mode, and in response to receiving the request and based on the status of the maximum regeneration mode and a current vehicle deceleration rate: (i) operating the electrified powertrain in either the maximum regeneration mode or a normal regeneration mode, (ii) selectively outputting a message to the driver indicative of the status of the maximum regeneration mode, and (iii) selectively commanding a hydraulic brake system of the vehicle to generate brake force based on a driver-expected vehicle deceleration rate associated with the operative regeneration mode.
