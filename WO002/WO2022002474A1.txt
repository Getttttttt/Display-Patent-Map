abstract
    The present invention relates to a drive system (1) for a vehicle (2), particularly for a mining truck (3) or a rail vehicle (4), comprising - an inverter (11) and a motor (12) - a DC link (13) configured to be supplied with a voltage be¬ tween 1500V and 3300V during operation of the drive system (1) - a first DC/DC chopper (21) connecting a battery (31) with the DC link (13). To improve the drive system, it is proposed that the drive system (1) further comprises a second DC/DC chopper (22) connecting an energy storage (32) of a lithium-ion capacitor with the DC link (13), wherein the energy storage (32) of a lithium-ion capacitor comprises a lithium-ion capacitor, particularly a combination of a lithium-ion battery and a capacitor like a double layer capacitor, wherein the drive system (1) is implemented brake-resistor-free. The present invention further relates to a mining truck (3) or a rail vehicle (4) with the proposed drive system (1). Additionally, the invention relates to a method for controlling the proposed drive system (1), the proposed Mining truck (3) or the proposed rail vehicle (4), wherein the maximum power of charging or discharging of the battery (31) is limited to a predetermined value.
