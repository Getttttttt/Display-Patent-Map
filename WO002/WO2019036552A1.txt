abstract
    Various embodiments of a locomotive waste heat recovery system for charging an auxiliary battery, independent of the locomotive electric generator, are disclosed. The auxiliary battery is charged by a locomotive waste heat recovery system to supplement and supply the electric power normally provided by the locomotive battery during a shutdown condition caused by a locomotive auto engine start stop (AESS) system. The auxiliary battery is charged by recovery and conversion of waste thermal energy during locomotive engine operations, and its stored electric power is utilized to supply selected electrical loads during a prolonged engine shutdown condition. Accordingly, the locomotive battery can preserve its stored power to be exclusively utilized for locomotive engine start, which may decrease operational disruptions and increase the life of the locomotive battery, and thereby reducing the overall operating costs associated with the battery maintenance efforts.
