abstract
    A system and method for increasing efficiency of a heavy electric vehicle, particularly, a truck at variable speed wherein a computer area network is designed to control all the parameters of the electric vehicle. An electric vehicle to which the present invention is applicable includes at least one battery for storing electric energy, a battery management system to monitor the individual cell temperature in battery while charging or discharging to protect it as a protection layer, at least one motor for generating a driving force from the electric energy of the battery, a motor control unit to control the operation between the battery and the motor, a vehicle control unit that controls all the signals and monitors the state of the components thereon, a transmission control unit that measures the propeller shaft speed and shifts the gear in the gearbox and a battery cooling system for controlling and monitoring the individual cell temperature.
