abstract
    Vaporizer cores are disclosed including a housing and a chamber where the chamber includes a porous lattice structure that is thermally conductive. Further, the housing and the chamber including the porous lattice structure are formed as a single integral structure. Three-dimensional (3D) printing can be used to form the housing and the chamber including the porous lattice structure as a single integral structure. For certain embodiments, a concentric-circle fin design, a crisscross fin design, or a conical fin design is used to form the porous lattice structure for the vaporizer chamber. For further embodiments, techniques are implemented to resolve potential problems with 3D printing of the vaporizer cores. One example technique is encapsulation of the vaporizer core within a shell, such as a two-piece shell, to resolve potential problems with leaks. Disclosed embodiments for the vaporizer cores provide manufacturing, material, and design improvements to prior solutions.
