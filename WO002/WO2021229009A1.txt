abstract
    The present invention relates to a device for heat-treating solid material, in particular in granular form, wherein the device comprises a kiln and an external heat generator, wherein said kiln comprises at least one sloped sliding surface on which a bed of said solid material slides down within said kiln due to gravity while a hot gas generated by the external heat generator is led through said solid material to heat said solid material to a desired temperature in order to change the substance properties of said solid material. According to the invention, said external heat generator for generating said hot gas is external to said kiln, wherein said kiln further comprises at least one kiln gas inlet through which said hot gas enters said kiln, such that the necessary temperature of said hot gas can be controlled precisely in that said hot gas is generated in said external heat generator, ensuring that the solid material does not experience temperatures above an allowed maximum temperature, and further such that the solid material is not exposed to radiation from a burner.
