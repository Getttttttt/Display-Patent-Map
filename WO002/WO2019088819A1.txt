abstract
    The present invention, in general, relates to a low energy consumption air-conditioning system (100) enabled by a second stage temperature booster for air conditioning system. The key to the invention is the resulting consistent low energy consumption air conditioning system. The low energy consumption air conditioning system of the present invention has higher energy saving of up to 40% as compared to the inverter air conditioning system with the same horsepower. This is due to the lower running current throughout the operation of the low energy consumption air conditioning system of the present invention.
