abstract
    A cooling system for cooling hot components of a radial or axial gas turbine engine, which includes a recuperator heat exchanger, provides engine cooling without loss of thermal efficiency. Air flow leaving a compressor is split between a recuperator flow path and a bleed flow path. Air in the bleed flow path flows through the hot parts of the engine, thereby cooling the engine and heating the air. The air in the bleed flow path is combined with the output flow from a combustor and directed into a turbine inlet. A reduction of air flow in the recuperator flow path increases the thermal effectiveness of the recuperator heat exchanger by increasing a ratio of hot and cold flows inside the heat exchanger. The increase in thermal effectiveness of the heat exchanger compensates for energy losses incurred by diverting a portion of the compressor air flow for cooling.
