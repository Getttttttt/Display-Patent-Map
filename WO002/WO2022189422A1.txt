abstract
    A method of steam cracking using a steam cracking using a steam cracking system (100) including a first steam cracking furnace unit (1000) or a plurality of first steam cracking furnace units (1000) and a second steam cracking furnace unit (2000) or a plurality of second steam cracking furnace units (2000) is proposed, wherein the first steam cracking furnace unit (1000) or each of the plurality of first steam cracking furnace units (1000) comprises one or more fired steam cracking furnaces (110), the second steam cracking furnace unit (2000) or each of the plurality of second steam cracking furnace units (2000) comprises one or more electric steam cracking furnaces (210), and the first steam cracking furnace unit (1000) or each of the plurality of first steam cracking furnace units (1000) comprises means for preheating at least a part of combustion air provided to its fired steam cracking furnace or furnaces (110) to a temperature level of at least 100 °C. A corresponding system (100) is also part of the present invention.
