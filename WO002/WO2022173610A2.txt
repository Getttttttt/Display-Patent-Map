abstract
    Supports with integrated sensors for nuclear reactor steam generators, and associated systems and methods, are disclosed. A representative method for forming a nuclear-powered steam generator includes forming an instrumented support, the instrumented support including a carrier portion and a retainer portion, with at least one of the carrier portion or the retainer portion being integrally formed with a sensor via an additive manufacturing process. The method can further include coupling the sensor to a communication link, supporting a helical steam conduit on the instrumented support, and installing the helical steam conduit and the instrumented support in a nuclear reactor. The helical steam conduit is positioned along a primary flow path, which is in turn positioned to circulate a heated primary flow in thermal communication with the helical steam conduit.
