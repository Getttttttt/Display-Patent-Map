abstract
    Systems and methods for distribution of electrical power. Embodiments include a vehicle, such as a train or an automobile with an electric generator, a plurality of vehicle terminals for temporarily receiving the vehicle, each including an energy distribution station having an electrical input and an electrical output, and an energy storage device selectively coupleable to the electric generator to store energy and to an electrical input of a vehicle terminal of the plurality of vehicle terminals to transmit the stored energy. The electrical output is electrically coupleable to an energy receiver such as an energy storage facility, a local electric load, and or an electrical grid. In embodiments, the energy storage device is detachable from the vehicle for temporary storage proximate the energy distribution station.
