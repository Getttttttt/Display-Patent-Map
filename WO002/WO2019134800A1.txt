abstract
    The invention refers to a method for providing pressurized gas at different pressure levels from a source (1) of liquefied gas to different pressure level consumers (10, 11, 12), wherein vaporized gas is supplied from the source (1) of liquefied gas through a main input line (2) to a compressor arrangement (3) for pressurizing the vaporized gas, the compressor arrangement (3) comprising a plurality of compressor modules (30, 31, 32) connected in series and/or in parallel, each compressor module being able to operate independently from any other compressor module of the compressor arrangement, and wherein gas flows of different pressure levels are generated by conducting the respective gas flow through one or more compressor modules (30, 31, 32) of the compressor arrangement (3), and wherein each of the different gas flows of different pressure levels is conducted through one of different consumer branch lines (20, 21, 22) to the respective different pressure level consumer (10, 11, 12).
