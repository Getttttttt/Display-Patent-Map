abstract
    A regenerative actuation system is taught for actuating a downhole pump. The system includes a lift cylinder in connection with the downhole pump, said cylinder moveable from an upstroke position to a downstroke position for actuation of the downhole pump; a hydraulic pump for pumping hydraulic fluid to the lift cylinder to actuate the lift cylinder in the upstroke and for receiving hydraulic fluid from the lift cylinder in the downstroke, thus allowing fluid flow in both directions; a flywheel for collecting energy from the hydraulic pump in the downstroke and for powering the hydraulic pump in the upstroke; and a motor for initiating rotation of the flywheel until the flywheel ramps up to its operating speed. An internal rod rotator assembly is also taught for engaging connection between a piston of a hydraulic lift cylinder, a cylinder rod and a rod string running downhole to an artificial lift pump, including a drive assembly having a first end comprising a set of drive dogs, the drive dogs being engageable with the lift cylinder piston; a lead nut connected to a second end of the drive assembly; and a lead screw anchored to a lower cylinder flange of the lift cylinder. Downward movement of the lift cylinder piston as engaged with the drive dogs serves to move the drive assembly downwardly and to threadably and rotationally engage the lead nut with the lead screw, causing rotation of the drive assembly and in turn rotation of the lift cylinder piston, cylinder rod and the rod string.
