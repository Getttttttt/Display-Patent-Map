abstract
    The invention relates to a hydraulic energy handling system (16) for a working machine (10). The hydraulic energy handling system (16) comprises a high-pressure side (54); a low-pressure side (56); a hydraulic machine (58) for mechanically driving, and being mechanically driven by, a mechanical driveline (14) of the working machine (10); at least one high-pressure hydraulic energy storage (64) connected to the high-pressure side (54); a hydraulic motor (76) having an inlet side (80) and an outlet side (82); a hydraulic pump (74) arranged to supply hydraulic fluid to the inlet side (80) of the hydraulic motor (76); and a return line (70) for conducting hydraulic fluid to a hydraulic tank (68). The hydraulic energy handling system (16) further comprises a pressure relief valve (72) connected between the high-pressure side (54) and the return line (70), the pressure relief valve (72) being arranged to discharge excess hydraulic energy from the high-pressure side (54) to the return line (70) in order to provide a braking force on the mechanical driveline(14); and a priority valve arrangement (86) connected to the outlet side (82) of the hydraulic motor (76), the priority valve arrangement (86) being configured to direct a prioritized flow of hydraulic fluid to the low-pressure side (56).
