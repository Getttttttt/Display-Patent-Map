abstract
    Embodiments of the present disclosure can include a system. The system can include a hydrocarbon production site. The system can include a direct contact steam generator (DCSG) system. The DCSG system can be configured to generate steam and supply the steam to an unconventional oil recovery process. The DCSG system can reside in close proximity to the hydrocarbon production site. The DCSG can include a DCSG boiler to which feedwater is provided, the feedwater being treated and supplied to the DCSG system from a remote central processing facility (CPF).
