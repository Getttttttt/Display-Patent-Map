abstract
    The invention includes automotive accessories, mechanics, and electronics. In automatic or manual transmission cars, when the driver brakes, the force wasted between the pad and the car's wheel disc is stored in a spring, and when the car is stopped, it shuts off automatically. Whenever the driver wants to move the car, this force is applied to the engine automatically and without any additional noise, and the car turns on. In urban traffic, this system consumes up to 20% of noise and biological pollution as well as fuel consumption, decreases.
