abstract
    The invention provides a vehicle installation for vehicle cooling. The vehicle installation includes an air inlet towards a front end of a vehicle, an air outlet towards a rear end of the vehicle, an air duct extending from the air inlet to the air outlet which defines a flow path along a longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and at least one heat exchanger positioned on or in the air duct. The at least one heat exchanger is in thermal communication with air flowing through the air duct, thereby providing vehicle cooling when in use. The invention further provides vehicle installations, as described, further having turbines and/or reduction arrangements for electricity generation.
