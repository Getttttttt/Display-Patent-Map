abstract
    A brake system for a vehicle having a first electric motor arranged to provide regenerative braking torque to a first wheel and a friction braking device arranged to provide a friction brake torque to the first wheel, the brake system comprising a controller arranged in response to receiving a torque demand to generate a first control signal for applying a regenerative braking torque by the first electric motor to the first wheel, wherein the first control signal provides an indication of a regenerative braking torque value, and a second control signal for applying a friction braking torque by the friction braking device to the first wheel, wherein the second control signal provides an indication of a friction braking torque value, wherein upon determining an estimate for the friction braking torque applied to the first wheel the controller is arranged to modulate the regenerative braking torque applied by the first electric motor to the first wheel based on the difference between the friction braking torque value indicated by the second control signal and the estimated friction braking torque.
