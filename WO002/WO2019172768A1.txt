abstract
    Building, comprising at least one living space, separated from an outside space by at least one outer wall, wherein at least one heat exchanger unit is provided at said outer wall and wherein at least one ventilator is provided for said heat exchanger unit, for forcing air through a heat exchanger of the heat exchanger unit, wherein an air outlet duct is connected to the heat exchanger unit for allowing air to be expelled from the at least one living space through the heat exchanger, such that heat can be exchanged in the heat exchanger between air flowing into the at least one hving space and air being expelled from said at least one living space, wherein in said at least one living space at least one sensor unit is provided for assessment of air quahty and/or noise in said at least one living space and control of the at least one ventilator and/or the at least one heat exchanger unit based on the assessed air quality and/or noise level in said living space.
