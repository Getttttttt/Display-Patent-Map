abstract
    The disclosure relates to a boil-off gas (BOG) reliquefaction system comprising at least one liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo tank (10), a BOG preheater (11), at least one BOG compressor (12) with a BOG compressor cooler (13), a BOG recondenser (14) with a refrigeration cycle, wherein the BOG reliquefaction system comprises a separate liquid circuit with circulation of a liquid phase heat transfer fluid (HTF) for preheating of BOG from the LNG cargo tank (10) before the BOG entering the BOG compressor (12), the separate liquid circuit comprising a liquid pump (15) configured to pump the HTF, the BOG preheater (11) configured for heat exchanging between the BOG and the HTF, the BOG recondenser (14) located downstream the BOG preheater (11), and a liq-uid trim heater (16) located downstream the BOG recondenser (14) configured for heat-ing the HTF. The disclosure further relates to a method for reliquefaction of boil-off gas (BOG) in a reliquefaction system and a method for operating a boil-off gas (BOG) reliquefaction system.
