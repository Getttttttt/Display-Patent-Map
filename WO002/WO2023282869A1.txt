abstract
    The present invention relates to an air-conditioning system (10) for providing changing of the air conditions of the medium by transforming a fluid (30), which is in the first phase and connected to a vehicle motor (20), into a second phase during the movement of said fluid (30) along a closed cycle in a manner receiving the waste heat formed by means of said vehicle motor (20). Accordingly, the subject matter air-conditioning system (10) comprises a pressure changing unit (100) for providing balancing of the pressure of said fluid (30) which is in the first phase, a first state changing unit (200) for providing condensing of the fluid (30) which is in the first phase and which exits said pressure changing unit (100) and for providing passage of said fluid (30) to the second phase, and a second state changing unit (300) for providing evaporating of the fluid (30) which is in the second phase and which exits said first state changing unit (200) and for providing transforming of the fluid (30) into the first phase again.
