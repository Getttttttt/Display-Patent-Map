abstract
    A cooling system (1), and a related method, for devices which produce excess heat, allows an extraction of residual heat from the circulating fluids more effectively with respect to the conventional systems, so that the residual heat could be recovered and exploited, in case even to increase the overall effectiveness of the cooling system, and it comprises: a heat exchanger (2) with two cooling circuits (4, 5) and respective coolants with a negative enthalpy of mixing, means for circulating the refrigerant fluids; means (20) for mixing the coolants for the enthalpy exothermic release in the obtained mixture; and means (23) for extracting heat from said mixture, wherein the outlet temperatures (T2) from the exchanger (2) of the two coolants have a temperature difference lower than 5Â°C.
