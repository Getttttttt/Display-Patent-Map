abstract
    An energy recovery drive system includes a motor-generator that is structured to selectively operate in a motor mode and a generator mode. A first shaft is operatively coupled to a transmission power take-off shaft. A second shaft is operatively coupled to the motor-generator and to an alternative power source. The energy recovery drive system is controllably operated in a plurality of operating modes. In a first operating mode, the motor-generator is in torque providing engagement with each of the first and second shafts. In a second operating mode, the motor-generator is in torque communicating engagement with each of the first and second shafts. In a third operating mode, which the motor-generator is in torque communicating engagement with the second shaft and is disengaged from transferring torque to the first shaft and from receiving torque from the first shaft.
