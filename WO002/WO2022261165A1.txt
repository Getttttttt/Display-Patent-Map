abstract
    An example valve includes: a seat member; a spool configured to be seated on the seat member to block fluid flow from a first port to a second port when the valve is in a closed state, wherein fluid at the first port applies a fluid force on the spool; a spring applying a biasing force on the spool toward the seat member, wherein as the fluid force overcomes the biasing force, the spool moves in the proximal direction off the seat member, thereby allowing fluid flow from the first port to the second port through a flow area formed between the spool and the seat member; a turbine configured to rotate as fluid flowing through the flow area flows downstream across the turbine; and an electric generator coupled to the turbine, such that rotation of the turbine causes the electric generator to generate electric power.
