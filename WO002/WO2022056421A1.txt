abstract
    A powertrain system for a vehicle is described. The powertrain system includes a first energy storage unit, a second energy storage unit, and an electronic control unit coupled to the first energy storage unit and the second energy storage unit. The first energy storage unit is configured to provide power to drive a first set of wheels of the vehicle. The second energy storage unit is configured to provide power to drive a second set of wheels of the vehicle different from the first set of wheels. The first and second energy storage units have different energy storage and/or energy discharge characteristics. The electronic control unit is programmed to control a charge and/or a discharge operation of the first energy storage unit and the second energy storage unit. The powertrain system is capable of implementing control strategies for optimizing energy and power to meet various driving demands of the vehicle.
