abstract
    As explained in detail above, the invention is a steam boiler system, comprised of a gasifier thermomechanical system (12) operating with autothermic gasification method by automatically adjusting according to the characteristics of the solid fuel used, combustion thermomechanical system (15) that minimizes the combustion losses for the gas and solid part of the coal by realizing the solid fuel part after gasification with the smokeless combustion process in the same combustion chamber, gasification and combustion air intake - distribution mechanical system (13) that distributes the gasification and combustion air according to the needs of the system, electromechanical control and automation system (14) that adjusts the working system of the boiler and enables maximization of combustion efficiency by using parameters that determine the combustion efficiency in the combustion product gases, and manages the combustion process with gasification and combustion efficiency maximization system (16) with full automation working with autothermic gasification method that maximizes the combustion efficiency by minimizing the combustion losses of both the autothermic gasification product gases and the post-gasification solid fuel combustion losses.
