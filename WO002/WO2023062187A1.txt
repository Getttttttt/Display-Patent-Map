abstract
    A method for controlling a multitude of braking means (12, 14, 16) of a vehicle to effect a desired brake function quantified as a desired brake parameter, wherein each of the braking means (12, 14, 16) is controllable by an actuation parameter to effect at least a portion of said desired brake function, comprising the steps: Determine, for each braking means (12, 14, 16), a brake capability representing a maximum brake function achievable by the braking means (12, 14, 16); Determine, for each braking means (12, 14, 16), an actuation priority, wherein the actuation priority is determined from at least one predetermined operating parameter of the braking means (12, 14, 16) and/or the vehicle; in order from highest priority to lowest priority of the braking means (12, 14, 16), Allocating, to each braking means (12, 14, 16), the actuation parameter, wherein the actuation parameter is chosen between the brake capability and the quantity of the desired brake parameter not yet allocated to other braking means (12, 14, 16), whichever is lower. Furthermore, a braking system for a vehicle, configured to carry out said method.
