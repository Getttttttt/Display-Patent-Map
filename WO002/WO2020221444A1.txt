abstract
    The invention relates to a steam generator (6) for a pressurized water reactor, comprising a tube sheet (34), a steam space (36) adjoining the tube sheet (34), and a number of steam generator tubes (4) being designed to carry a primary re- actor coolant during normal operation, wherein each steam generator tube (4) comprises a first tube section being fixed in the tube sheet (34) and a second tube section protruding into the steam space (36), and wherein at least one of the steam generator tubes (4) is closed by a sealing plug (40) inserted into the first tube section. In order to minimize the risk of rupture of the such-closed steam generator tube (4) in a manner which is easy to produce, to install, and to maintain, the invention suggest a separate stabilizer (2) inserted into said closed steam generator tube (4) adjacent to or above the sealing plug (40), the stabilizer (2) comprising a lengthy body (8) with a clamping section (30) fixed inside the first tube section and a sup- porting section (26) resting against the second tube section, wherein the stabilizer (2) is designed to permit a fluid flow through and/or around its body (8).
