abstract
    The invention describes a checker brick (1) comprising: - a body (2) with an upper base (3), a lower base (3') and six lateral side faces (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6); - 7 vertical through passages (4) with internal walls (4.3) and one first end opening (4.1) and a second end opening (4.2); - the passages (4) being arranged in parallel rows with the side faces (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6), - one lateral channel (6) located on each side face (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6), at the intersection of two of the rows with passages (4); - each channel (6), having the area of a cross-section equal to half of the area of a cross-section of a passage (4); - one corner channel (7), placed instead of each side edge of the body (2), connecting the two bases (3, 3'); - each channel (7) representing one end of a row with passages (4) and has an area of a cross section equal to one third of the area of a cross section of a passage (4); - the upper base (3) has the area larger than the area of the lower base (3') and the first opening (4.1) of each passage (4) in the plane of the base (3) has the area smaller than the area of the second opening (4.2) of each passage (4) in the base plane (3') characterized in that, - each passage (4) is connected to the adjacent passage (4) on two directions of parallel rows from the total of three directions in the plane of the bases (3, 3') and, depending on the position of the passage (4), to the adjacent channel (6, 7) by means of at least one horizontal channel (8, 8'), placed such as to allow the flow of fluids both vertically and horizontally through themselves and through the passages (4) and the channels (6, 7) and - the walls (4.3) of the passages (4), the side faces (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6) and the channels (6, 7) have the same angle of inclination from about 0.85° to 4°, measured with respect to the central vertical axis of the body (2) and - the area of a cross-section in the plane of a base (3, 3') of each passage (4), channel (6, 7) allows stacking of several bricks (1) by aligning the centers of the longitudinal axis of symmetry of at least two passages (4), at least two channels (6, 7) or of one passage (4) and of one channel (6, 7) such that each passage (4) and each channel (6, 7) with a large area of a cross-section in the plane of a base (3, 3') is stacked on a passage (4), a channel (6, 7) with a small area of a cross-section in the plane of another base (3, 3'); each passage (4) and each channel (6, 7) with a small area of a cross section is stacked on a passage (4), a channel (6, 7) with a large area of a cross section of at least two stacked bricks (1 ). This invention also presents a structure (11) with a plurality of such bricks (1) and a method for constructing a structure (11).
