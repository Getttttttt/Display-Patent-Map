abstract
    A method to produce carbon black includes, in a carbon black reactor having combustion zone and a reaction zone and a feedstock injection zone therebetween, converting a portion of at least one hydrocarbon feedstock to carbon black in the presence of combustion gases generated by burning a fuel in an oxidation gas mixture containing low amounts of nitrogen to form a product stream in which carbon black is carried by hot gases. The carbon black is separated from the hot gas, which is then processed to produce a flue gas high in carbon dioxide and low in nitrogen at least a portion of which is redirected to at least one of the combustion zone, the reaction zone, and the feedstock injection zone.
