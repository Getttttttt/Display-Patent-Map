abstract
    A ventilation unit with heat recovery, comprising a first block (2.1) having an air interconnection to the interior of the building, a third block (2.3) having an air interconnection to the exterior of the building and a second block (2.2) located between them, in which the heat recovery exchanger (14) is located, with at least one first channel (a) and at least one second channel (b). The second block (2.2) is insertable between the first block (2.1) and the third block (2.3) in such manner that the first channels (a) are airtightly connectable to one of the air ducts (21, 22) of the first block (2.1) and also to one of the air ducts (23, 24) of the third block (2.3). Also the second channels (b) are airtightly connectable to one of the air ducts (21, 22) of the first block (2.1), different from the air duct to which the first channels (a) are connectable, and the second channels (b) are also airtightly connectable to one of the air ducts (23, 24) of the third block (2.3), different from the air duct to which the first channels (a) are connectable.
