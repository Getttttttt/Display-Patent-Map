abstract
    A method of steam cracking using a steam cracking arrangement (1100-1500) including one or more fired cracking furnaces (110), one or more quench cooling trains (20) and one or more compressors (60) and/or pumps as rotating equipment is proposed, wherein one or more process gas streams is or are passed at least through the one or more fired cracking furnaces (110) and the one or more quench cooling trains (20), and wherein the rotating equipment is at least partly driven by electric energy. According to the invention, one or more steam generation arrangements (30) is or are operated in thermal association with the one or more steam cracking arrangements (1100-1500), wherein using the one or more steam generation arrangements (30) at least superheated high pressure steam at a first pressure level of 30 and 175 bar absolute pressure and at a first temperature level and no steam at a higher temperature level than the first temperature level is generated, wherein the superheated high pressure steam at the first pressure level is at least in part adiabatically and isenthalpically expanded to a second pressure level below the first pressure level such that its temperature level is lowered to a second temperature level, and wherein the first temperature level is selected such that each intermediate temperature level reached at intermediate pressure levels of more than 20 bar during the adiabatic and isenthalpic expansion process is between 5 and 120 K above the dew point of steam at the respective intermediate pressure level during the adiabatic and isenthalpic expansion. A corresponding system (100) is also part of the present invention.
