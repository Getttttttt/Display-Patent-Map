abstract
    A water heater includes an outer casing defining a longitudinal axis, an axial direction being defined as extending along the longitudinal axis. The water heater further includes a combustor for production of hot flue gases, a primary heat exchanger including a tube positioned within the outer casing, and a secondary heat exchanger including a plurality of plates coupled together by brazing to form a brazed plate heat exchanger. The secondary heat exchanger includes a first set of passages defined between the plates, and a second set of passages defined between the plates and alternating with the first set of passages in the axial direction. The primary and secondary heat exchangers are in fluid communication such that the flue gases flow through the second set of passages before being exhausted, and water to be heated flows through the first set of passages to a delivery point for use upon demand.
