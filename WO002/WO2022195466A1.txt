abstract
    One aspect of the invention relates to a switching device (16) for a switchable braking system (1) comprises a hydraulic selector valve (21) switchable to a first switching position and a second switching position, a switching actuation device (28), electrically triggerable, for switching the hydraulic selector valve (21) from the first switching position to the second switching position, wherein the switching device (16) comprises at least one of: • i) a switching preservation system (29), which stops the hydraulic selector valve (21) in the second switching position by means of a non-electromagnetic stopping force, chosen from the group consisting of fluid-mechanical forces, elastic forces, mechanical forces, permanent magnetic forces, OR • ii) an amplification system (30) comprising: • - a non-electrical accumulator of potential energy (31), and • - a switchable connector (32) to disconnect and connect the potential energy accumulator (31) with the hydraulic selector valve (21), wherein an actuator (33) applies an actuating force to the switchable connector (32) to connect the potential energy accumulator (31) to the hydraulic selector valve (21), wherein said actuating force is less than a switching force applied by the potential energy accumulator (31) onto the hydraulic selector valve (21) to switch it and maintain it in the second switching position. Other aspects of the invention relate to a braking system (1) and to a brake-by-wire module (56).
