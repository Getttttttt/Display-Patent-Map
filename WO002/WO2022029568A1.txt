abstract
    Treatment apparatus of hot flue gases emitted by an industrial plant, comprising a gas circuit and having a first heat exchange chamber along a first branch and a second heat exchange chambers along a second branch, a temperature measuring device and/or a flow rate measuring device of the flue gases, a regulating member movable at least between a first position and a second position. In the first position transit of the flue gases into the first heat exchange chamber is allowed, while transit of flue gases into the second heat exchange chamber is prevented or reduced, and in second position transit of the flue gases into both the first and the second heat exchange chambers is allowed. A control unit is configured to command the regulating member in the first or in the second position based on the temperature and/or flow rate values of the flue gases.
