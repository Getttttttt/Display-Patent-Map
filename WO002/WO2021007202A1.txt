abstract
    A system includes a coolant circuit, a waste heat recovery (WHR) circuit and a controller. The coolant circuit providing coolant to an engine includes a first coolant sub-circuit including a radiator valve and a radiator, and a second coolant sub-circuit including a WHR heat exchanger. The WHR system includes the WHR heat exchanger and a bypass valve coupled across the WHR heat exchanger. The controller coupled to the radiator valve and the bypass valve is configured to operate the bypass valve to direct working fluid into the heat exchanger if a coolant temperature is above a first threshold value, and operate the radiator valve to direct coolant from the second sub-circuit to the first sub-circuit if at least one of the coolant temperature is above a second threshold value, the working fluid temperature is above a third threshold value or the working fluid pressure is above a fourth threshold value.
