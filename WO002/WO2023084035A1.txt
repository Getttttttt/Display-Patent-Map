abstract
    Method for producing energy by means of a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) regenerative Brayton cycle with N recuperators in series and N or N-1 auxiliary compressors, where N ≥ 3. By using a higher number of recuperators in series and an auxiliary compressor for each recuperator, the heat recovery process is improved and thus the performance of the cycle compared to the cycles of the state-of-the-art.
