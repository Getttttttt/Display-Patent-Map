abstract
    A room-based ventilation system (50) and a building (100). The room-based ventilationthe system (50) comprises a first outlet channel (11) and a second outlet channel (12)for connecting to room outlets which spaced apart, first air flowing means (13A, 13B)arranged to cause flow of air into and out of the room, respectively, wherein the room-based ventilation system (50) is configured so that air is flowing, by the first air flowingmeans (13A, 13B), substantially simultaneously into the room via one of the outlet chan-nels (11, 12) and out of the room via other of the outlet channels (11, 12). The system(50) also comprises at least two heat storage elements (20A, 20B) arranged into the out-let channels (11, 12) for recovering heat from and for providing heat to air flowing inthe outlet channels (11, 12).
