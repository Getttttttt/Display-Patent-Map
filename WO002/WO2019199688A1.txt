abstract
    Disclosed techniques include energy storage and management using pumping. An energy source is connected to a pump-turbine energy management system, wherein the pump-turbine energy management system includes a pump-energy storage subsystem. Energy from the energy source is stored in the pump-energy storage subsystem. One or more processors are used to calculate a valve-based flow control setting for recovering energy from the pump-energy storage subsystem. One or more valves in the pump-energy management system are energized, wherein the energizing enables energy recovery. Energy is recovered from the pump-energy storage subsystem using a pump-turbine recovery subsystem enabled by the one or more valves that were energized. Waste heat is recovered through a waste-heat recovery subsystem which includes water heat exchangers or a fluid spray. The water from the water heat exchangers can be used to make steam or ice.
