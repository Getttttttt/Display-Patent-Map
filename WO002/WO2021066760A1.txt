abstract
    The invention is a solid-fuel burning and drying unit (1) capable of carbonized drying and burning of toxic gases, having a main body (30), comprising a fuel cell (2) configured in the said main body (30), a barrier surface (4) which closes said fuel cell from the upper region and enables combustion of toxic and volatile gases in the combustion zone (7) without mixing with the atmosphere, fuel supply elements and fuel discharge elements that deliver fuels to be burned into the fuel cell, wherein; comprising, that the said main body (30) contains a drying unit (10) in which the damp fuel is dried by heat from the combustion zone (7) by generating frictional energy by rotating through the configured drive element and coils (11) on the axis of rotation (z).
