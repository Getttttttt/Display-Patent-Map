abstract
    The invention relates to a device for removing the slag from the deslagging area of a furnace and for recovering thermal energy from the slag. The device comprises: - a loading zone, which receives the hot liquid slag; - an unloading zone, which releases the cooled solid slag; - a dragging conveyor extending from the loading zone to the unloading zone and which comprises: - a support surface supporting the slag; and - a plurality of dragging elements dragging the slag; - a thermal exchange circuit which extends along the dragging conveyor and which comprises a thermal carrier fluid suitable for absorbing part of the heat in the slag and to render it available for a user device. In accordance with a second aspect, the invention relates to a steelmaking plant comprising a furnace and a device according to the invention. In accordance with a third aspect, the invention relates to a method for removing the slag and for recovering thermal energy from the slag.
