abstract
    An automated control loop for dynamically adjusting a temperature of wet steam is provided. This leads to increased heat transfer and decreased fouling in a reboiler of a distillation column used for distilling a petrochemical. The control loop includes controlling the combining of condensed water with dry steam to produce the wet steam. The produced wet steam is input to the reboiler in order to transfer heat to the petrochemical while being converted to the condensed water. The control loop further includes monitoring a pressure of the produced wet steam, and setting a target temperature for the produced wet steam based on the monitored pressure. In addition, the control loop includes monitoring the temperature of the produced wet steam, and adjusting a proportion of the condensed water in the produced wet steam in response to the monitored temperature deviating from the set target temperature by at least a threshold value.
