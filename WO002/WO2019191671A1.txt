abstract
    Methods and systems for generating power (and optionally heat) from a high value heat source using a plurality of circulating loops comprising a primary heat transfer loop, several power cycle loops and an intermediate heat transfer loop that transfers heat from the high-temperature heat transfer loop to the several power cycle loops. The intermediate heat transfer loop is arranged to eliminate to the extent practical the shell and tube heat exchangers especially those heat exchangers that have a very large pressure difference between the tube side and shell side, to eliminate shell and tube, plate type, double pipe and similar heat exchangers that transfer heat directly from the primary heat transfer loop to the several power cycle loops with very high differential pressures and to maximize the use of heat transfer coils similar in design as are used in a heat recovery steam generator commonly used to transfer heat from gas turbine flue gas to steam or other power cycle fluids as part of a combined cycle power plant.
