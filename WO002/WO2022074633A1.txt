abstract
    The present disclosure relates to the field of boilers with economizers, and envisages a boiler (100) with an economizer. The boiler (100) comprises a boiler compartment (5), a smoke tube economizer (14) and a flue gas transfer conduit section between the boiler compartment (5) and the economizer (14). The smoke tube economizer (14) has a smoke tube section (14a) and a shell section (14b). The flue gas transfer conduit section receives flue gases from the boiler compartment (5) and transfers the received flue gases to the smoke tube section (14a) of the smoke tube economizer (14). The smoke tube economizer (14) is supported on the boiler compartment (5) through the flue gas transfer conduit section. Thus, no additional floor space is required for the smoke tube economizer (14).
