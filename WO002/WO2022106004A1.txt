abstract
    A method for controlling motion of a heavy-duty vehicle (100a, 100b), comprising obtaining (S1) information related to an upcoming vehicle path (p) and vehicle maneuver (m) along the path, obtaining (S2) information related to a road friction coefficient (μ) along the upcoming vehicle path (p), configuring (S3) lateral and longitudinal wheel slip limits (λlim) for at least two wheels of an axle (111, 151, 161, 162) or lumped group-axle (115, 125, 135, 145) on the heavy-duty vehicle (100a, 100b), wherein lateral and longitudinal wheel slip values are related to respective lateral and longitudinal tyre force values (Fx, Fy) via a pre-determined combined tyre slip model, determining (S4) a vehicle motion profile (a) for performing the vehicle maneuver (m) along the path (p) as a solution to a non-linear optimal control problem, NOCP, wherein the NOCP is constrained by the lateral and longitudinal wheel slip limits (λlim) and formulated to account for the road friction coefficient (μ) and/or curvature along the upcoming vehicle path (p), and controlling (S5) the motion of the heavy-duty vehicle (100a, 100b) along the path (p) based on the determined target vehicle motion profile (a).
