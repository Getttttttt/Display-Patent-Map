abstract
    The present invention relates to a heating arrangement (40) for an internal combustion engine coolant, and to a cooling circuit (22), wherein the coolant is arranged to circulate in the cooling circuit (22) and cool the internal combustion engine (2) and heat a fluid in a fluid tank (20) located downstream of the internal combustion engine (2) in the cooling circuit (22). The heating arrangement (40) comprises a heat transfer unit (42) configured to be positioned downstream of the fluid tank (20) and upstream of the internal combustion engine (2), wherein the heat transfer unit (40) is arranged to be heated by an exhaust gas line (50) of the internal combustion engine (2) and comprises means (46) to transfer the heat from the exhaust t gases to the coolant. Also, a vehicle (1) comprising the heating arrangement or a cooling circuit (22) is claimed.
