abstract
    The invention relates to an air vehicle (V), more than one wheel (2) enabling the aircraft (V) to move on a ground (Z), at least one rotating structure (3) provided on the aircraft (V) so as to be concentric with the wheel (2) and to perform rotational movement together with the wheel (2), a friction element (4), contacting and compressing the rotating structure (3) so as to generate a brake force to slow down the air vehicle (V), at least one actuator (5) triggered by an electric motor (E) to actuate the friction element (4) so that it moves closer to and/or away from the rotating structure (3), a control unit (6) enabling to control the amount of current given to the electric motor (E), more than one brake level (7) changing in dependence to the amount of current given to the electric motor (E) and expressing the magnitude of brake force applied to the air vehicle (V), through which the rotating structure (3) and friction element (4) contact each other.
