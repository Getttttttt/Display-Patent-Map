abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a coaxial flow distribution device (1) comprising: a first main body (3) having a first end face (3a) and a second end face (3b) at an opposite end of the first main body (3) with respect to the first end face (3a), wherein the first main body (3) is provided with a plurality of first flow distribution channels (5a) and a plurality of second flow distribution channels (9a) separated from the first flow distribution channels (5a), the first flow distribution channels (3a) and the second flow distribution channels (5a) extending from the first end face (3a) to the second end face (3b), wherein at the first end face (3a) a first mouth (5b) of each first flow distribution channel (5a) is provided one after the other in the circumferential direction along a first end face radial outer circumferentially extending band (7), and at the second end face (3b) a second mouth of each first flow distribution channel (5a) is provided one after the other in the circumferential direction along a second end face radial inner circumferentially extending band(15), wherein at the first end face (3a) a third mouth (9b) of each second flow distribution channel (9a) is provided one after the other in the circumferential direction along a first end face radial inner circumferentially extending band (11) provided radially inwards of the first end face radial outer circumferentially extending band (7), and at the second end face (3b) a fourth mouth of each second flow distribution channel (9a) is provided one after the other in the circumferential direction along a second end face radial outer circumferentially extending band (17) provided radially outwards of the second end face radially inner circumferentially extending band, and wherein the first main body (3) has a circumferential wall forming a radial outer wall of the first flow distribution channels (5a) and the second flow distribution channels (9a) between the first end face (3a) and the second end face (3b).
