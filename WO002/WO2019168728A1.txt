abstract
    Various embodiments of a system for the removal of particulate emissions from an electric generating unit are provided, comprising: a gas producer; a primary particulate collector unit including: a primary collection hopper field each including at least one primary collection hopper, wherein each primary collection hopper includes a primary collection hopper outlet, each primary collection hopper outlet fluidically connected to a particulate discharge duct; a flue duct inlet oriented upstream of the at least one primary collection hopper field; a flue duct outlet oriented downstream of the primary collection hopper field; wherein the gas producer is fluidically connected to the primary particulate collector unit by a flue duct; and a particulate recirculation duct fluidically connected at a first end to the primary collection hopper and/or the particulate discharge duct, and fluidically connected at a second end to the flue duct upstream of the primary particulate collector unit.
