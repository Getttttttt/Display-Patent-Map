abstract
    The invention relates to a heat exchanging device for air conditioning using indirect and direct adiabatic cooling. To increase efficiency of cooling in summer period system with pump M and nozzles (S1, S2) in section of heat exchanger is installed. Pump is circulating water over the installed piping system to nozzles S1 and S2. Water is sprayed into airstream F1, and in this way is adiabatically cooled which results in better indirect adiabatic cooling of airstream F2. In order to increase cooling of airstream even more, F2 system of nozzles S3 is connected to pump system, and is directly cooling airstream F2 with adiabatic process. Optionally, system allows installation of the three way valve on pump system for use during cold season, which results in desirable humidification of airstream F2.
