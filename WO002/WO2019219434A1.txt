abstract
    A heat cell comprises a premix gas burner and a heat exchanger. The premix gas burner is provided for the generation of flue gas by surface stabilized combustion of premixed combustible gas. The heat exchanger is provided for transfer of heat from the flue gas through the walls of the heat exchanger to fluid flowing continuously through the heat exchanger. The heat cell is alternatingly operated in burner-on and burner-off mode. During the burner-on-mode flue gas is generated by the premix gas burner. During the burner-off mode no flue gas is generated by the premix gas burner. During at least 50% of the burner-on mode the heat cell is operated such that in the heat exchanger liquid is condensed from the flue gas. During the final period of the burner-on mode before switching to burner-off mode, the heat cell is operated such that fluid in the heat exchanger is heated to higher temperatures than the average temperature to which the fluid is heated in the heat exchanger during the burner-on mode; such that during the final period of the burner on-mode the heat cell is operated in non-condensing mode and such that condensation liquid present in the heat exchanger is removed by evaporation.
