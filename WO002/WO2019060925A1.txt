abstract
    A method and apparatus for constructing Re Wheel, a Recovering Energy Wheel, is disclosed. Kinetic energy of an automobile is transformed during the automobile's deceleration via a specially built and attached to it regenerative braking component into a potential energy. This energy is then re-applied for the future acceleration of the automobile, being transformed back into kinetic energy of the automobile. A combination of the two components, the original wheel and the regenerative braking mechanism attached to it, represent the new wheel - Re Wheel. The efficiency of the Re Wheel device is much higher than within other methods of regenerative braking, including those used within electrical automobiles, when electrical engine works in electrical generator mode. Re Wheel is also original in its utility, via its ability to be applied to all the automobiles, independent of their engine type, electrical or combustion engines, and their engine power source.
