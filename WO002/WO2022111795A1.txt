abstract
    There is provided an energy storage pressure vessel (100) for a hydrogen vehicle (200). The energy storage pressure vessel (100) comprises a pressure vessel (110) for containing hydrogen gas (140) for fuel cells (220) of the hydrogen vehicle (200). The pressure vessel (110) is radially surrounded by a membrane (130). The energy storage pressure vessel (100) comprises an energy storage system (120a, 120b). The energy storage system (120a, 120b) is provided in the membrane (130). There is also provided a hydrogen vehicle (200) comprising such an energy storage pressure vessel (100).
