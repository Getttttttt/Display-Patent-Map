abstract
    The invention relates to a boiler for detecting a backflow of a liquid, in particular a backflow of a liquid originating from a blocked condensate trap, in a combustion chamber of the boiler, in particular for domestic hot water generation or central heating, the boiler comprises a burner for combusting fuel gas, in particular including hydrogen, wherein the boiler is arranged in the combustion chamber, characterized in that the boiler comprises a sensor for detecting liquid wherein the sensor includes at least one probe that is adapted and arranged in a geodetically lower part of the combustion chamber to get into physical contact with the liquid.
