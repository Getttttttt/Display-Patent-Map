abstract
    Method of conversion of installations of the type used for the hybrid propulsion of LNG carriers wherein said method is based on modifying a LNG carrier boiler of the installation, modifying the existing exhaust outlet integrating a new exhaust gas outlet, creating an opening in a combustion chamber of said LNG carrier boiler, introducing exhaust gases from a GTPG inside the opening created and adding a second superheater inside the exhaust gas outlet between the GTPG and the LNG carrier boiler, integrating an auxiliary steam and water system and integrating an automatic switching extraction system connected both system to the hybrid propulsion installation.
