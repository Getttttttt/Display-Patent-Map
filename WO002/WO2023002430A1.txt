abstract
    The invention concerns: A) An assembly to reduce the emission of CO2 in a plant for the production of clinkers comprising two calciners and a carbonator arranged between the two calciners, wherein one of the calciners is an integral part of a conventional clinker production system. Thanks to this assembly, the plant can continue to operate in the clinker production process even if the CO2 capture system which uses the carbonator and the other calciner of the assembly is disconnected due to malfunctions or maintenance characterized in that said carbonator is free of recirculation to both said two calciners. B) The relative plants comprising both the assembly and the actual clinker production plant in which the clinker production plant is of the conventional type existed before and already operational, or said plant is installed simultaneously with the assembly units. C) The clinker production process with reduction of CO2 emission conducted in the plants B.
