abstract
    The invention relates to a solid oxide fuel cell system and a steam generator thereof, wherein the steam generator comprises a water inlet pipe, a casing and a heat exchange device arranged in the casing; a heat exchange cavity is formed between the outer wall of the heat exchange device and the inner wall of the casing, the water inlet pipe communicates with the heat exchange cavity and is used for inputting liquid water into the heat exchange cavity, and the liquid water can exchange heat with the heat exchange device in the heat exchange cavity and form steam; the casing is further provided with a steam exhaust port for exhausting steam in the heat exchange cavity to a reforming device; a steam -water separation grid is arranged on the top wall of a side of the water inlet pipe facing the casing. The continuity and the uniformity of liquid water evaporation can be improved, so that the stability and the reliability of the solid oxide fuel cell system are ensured.
