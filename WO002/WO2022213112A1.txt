abstract
    Systems and generating power in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation to supply electrical power. In embodiments, an inlet temperature of a flow of gas from a source to an ORC unit may be determined. The source may connect to a main pipeline. The main pipeline may connect to a supply pipeline. The supply pipeline may connect to the ORC unit thereby to allow gas to flow from the source to the ORC unit. Heat from the flow of gas may cause the ORC unit to generate electrical power. The outlet temperature of the flow of the gas from the ORC unit to a return pipe may be determined. A bypass valve, positioned on a bypass pipeline connecting the supply pipeline to the return pipeline, may be adjusted to a position sufficient to maintain temperature of the flow of gas above a threshold based on the inlet and outlet temperature.
