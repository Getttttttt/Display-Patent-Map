abstract
    Vehicles and power banks use electric energy source management systems to manage sets of electric energy source (EES) devices. Examples of EES devices include battery cells, fuel cells, solar cells, and electric generators. An EES management system includes EES nodes and a command node that are connected together with fiber optic cables in a daisy chain communication ring topology to provide seamless and redundant communication. The command node duplicates a message and transmits a first instance of the message in one direction and simultaneously transmits a second instance of the same message in the other direction. Under nominal redundancy operation, a recipient EES node receives the first instance and the second instance of the message within an expected time from each other. In the event of breakage or failure in the network, the recipient EES node still receives the message with no data delay and with no data loss.
