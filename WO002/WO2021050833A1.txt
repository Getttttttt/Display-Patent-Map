abstract
    To preheat combustion air with gasification furnace flue gas, combustion air is flowed towards an inlet of a gasification furnace. The combustion air is heated using flue gas emitted from the gasification furnace. The flue gas is generated within the gasification furnace responsive to a gasification process. The heated combustion air is flowed into the inlet of the gasification furnace. The gasification process is implemented within the gasification furnace using the heated combustion air
