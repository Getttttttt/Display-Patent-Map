abstract
    An electric vehicle powertrain is disclosed. The powertrain includes an electric motor electrically coupled to an energy storage system That includes a motor control unit to determine a phase of the electric motor and a plurality of cells to determine a discrete power output based, at least in part, on the determined phase of the electric motor; and generate the determined discrete power output. The energy storage system includes a power bank management unit to determine an overall power output based, at least in part, on the determined phase of the electric motor; determine a subset of the plurality of cells based, at least in part, on the overall power output; and command each cell of the subset of the plurality of cells to generate the discrete power output, the subset of the plurality of cells to collectively generate an output equal to the overall power output.
