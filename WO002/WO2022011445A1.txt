abstract
    A combustion engine is disclosed that preferentially conducts the fuel heat release at the highest practically tolerable internal energy (applying to closed-cycle embodiments) or enthalpy (applying to steady-flow embodiments) states. One of several methods disclosed that achieves this objective is that the engine does not aspirate atmospheric air. Other methods disclosed exploit the intrinsic property of the choice of certain fuels and working gases to combust with lower exergy destruction than others. A method is also provided for reducing combustion chamber wall heat-transfer losses. All disclosed methods contribute to maximize the fuel or thermal efficiency of said combustion engine by systematically minimizing the total exergy destruction from the fuel resource in the combustion process and due to wall heat transfer losses, and then maximally exploit the resulting increased availability to extraction and conversion into useful work, electricity or other utile purposes.
