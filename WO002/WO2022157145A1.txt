abstract
    A method for managing power consumption of a railway vehicle is provided. The power consumption of the railway vehicle is managed by a central control unit of the railway vehicle. The central control unit receives information representing an amount of electrical traction power required for traction or generated by electrodynamic braking based on a traction demand set by the driver of the railway vehicle. The central control unit additionally receives information representing an amount of electrical auxiliary power demanded by auxiliary devices from control units of the respective auxiliary devices. The total available electrical power, which can be provided by the energy supply line for the railway vehicle, is determined. The central control unit prioritizes operation of the auxiliary devices based on the total available electrical power and the electrical traction power required for traction to selectively reduce consumption of electrical energy by all or selected auxiliary devices if a sum of the electrical traction power required for traction and the electrical auxiliary power demanded by auxiliary devices exceeds the total available electrical power.
