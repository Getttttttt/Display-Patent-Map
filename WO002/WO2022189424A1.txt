abstract
    A method of steam cracking using a steam cracking arrangement (2100-2800) including an electric cracking furnace (10) without a convection zone (12) and further including a quench cooling train (20) is proposed, wherein a process gas stream is passed at least through the electric cracking furnace (10) and the quench cooling train (20). It is provided that that the quench cooling train (20) is operated to comprise at least two distinct cooling steps arranged in either order, wherein in a first one of the cooling steps at least a part of the process gas stream withdrawn from the electric cracking furnace (10) is cooled against vaporizing boiler feed water at an absolute pressure level between 30 and 175 bar and wherein in a second one of the cooling steps at least a part of the process gas stream withdrawn from the electric cracking furnace (10) is cooled against a superheated mixture of feed hydrocarbons and process steam used in forming the process gas stream which is thereby heated to a temperature level between 350 and 750Â°C. A corresponding arrangement (2100-2800) is also part of the present invention.
