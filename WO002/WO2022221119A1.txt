abstract
    A system for managing storage of electrical energy can include an electromagnetic machine and a controller. The electromagnetic machine can have a rotor and a stator. The rotor can be configured to be connected to a shaft. One of the rotor or the stator can have first windings and second windings. The controller can be configured to control first circuitry and second circuitry. The first circuitry can be configured to cause energy to flow from a first energy storage device to the first windings to cause the shaft to rotate. The second circuitry can be configured to cause energy to flow selectively: (1) from a second energy storage device to the second windings to cause the shaft to rotate or (2) from the second windings to the second energy storage device to cause the second energy storage device to be charged.
