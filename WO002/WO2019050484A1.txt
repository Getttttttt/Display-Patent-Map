abstract
    The subject-matter of the invention is a ventilation device (1) of an oblong prismatic shape, which includes a pre-fabricated housing (11), wherein individual ventilation device components are arranged in the pre-fabricated housing (11) in a line. The pre-fabricated housing (11) is connected with a wall pipe (12) inserted into an opening provided in the wall, while a box-like external grid (17) is arranged on the external side of the external wall, in which grid a pivotal airflow distributer (19) is arranged. Fans (3a, 3b) are arranged in the pre-fabricated housing (11) in a way that the air intake openings face the interior of the pre-fabricated housing (11) and are separated from each other by a partition wall (5), while the air discharge openings each faces its own channel (2a, 2b). The housings of the fans (3a, 3b) and consequently the air intake openings and the air discharge openings are arranged in the pre-fabricated housing (11) either in parallel with the longer sides of the pre¬ fabricated housing (11) or rotated one relative the other at an angle with respect to the longer sides of the pre-fabricated housing (11), such that the axes of the air intake openings lie either on the same imaginary line which connects both axes or their axes are arranged on imaginary parallel lines offset in the longitudinal direction of the ventilation device (1), i. e. in the longitudinal direction of the longer sides of the housing (11).
