abstract
    The present invention relates to a steam boiler assembly (1), configured to heat water in order to generate steam, comprising at least one boiler (20, 30), a fuel heater (23), an electric heater (35, 36), a feed water inlet (11), a steam outlet (12), and a controller (50), wherein the controller (50) is configured to selectively activate or deactivate the fuel heater (23) and/or the electric heater (35, 36) to bring and keep the water in the at least one boiler (20, 30) at saturated conditions. The steam boiler assembly (1) further comprises a water-tube boiler (20), which comprises the fuel heater (23), an electrode boiler (30), which comprises the electric heater (35, 36), and a steam drum (10), which is configured to hold water and steam, wherein the feed water inlet (11) and the steam outlet (12) are fluidly connected to the steam drum (10). The water-tube boiler (20) and the electrode boiler (30) each comprise an inlet (21, 31) and an outlet (22, 32), which are fluidly connected to the steam drum (10). The inlet (21) of the water-tube boiler (20) is fluidly connected to the inlet (31) of the electrode boiler (30) and the interconnected inlets (21, 31) are configured to allow a flow of water from an activated one of the boilers (20, 30) to a deactivated one of the boilers (30, 20) in order to keep the water in the deactivated boiler at saturated conditions.
