abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a system and method of controlling the temperature and humidity of a conditioned space. The method and system are based on the two-phase pre-cooling of an airflow prior to dehumidification, wherein the airflow passes through a heat exchanger which initially cools and dehumidifies the air before it enters the dehumidifier for additional dehumidification.
