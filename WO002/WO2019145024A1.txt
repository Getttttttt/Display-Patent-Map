abstract
    Evaporative heat transfer device (10) for cooling air, comprising a heat exchanger (20), having a plurality of auxiliary passageways (30) and a plurality of main passageways (32), wherein the auxiliary passageways (30) and the main passageways (32) are separated from each other by at least one heat exchange wall (60) in common to exchange heat, a mist chamber (56) and a mist generator (74) connected to the mist chamber (56) designed to inject microscopic water droplets in the auxiliary air (12) in the mist chamber (56) to form in operation a mist with an absolute humidity equal or higher than the dew point absolute humidity; and the absolute humidity is equal or higher than the dew point absolute humidity over at least 50% of the total length of the auxiliary passageways (30). Preferably, the mist generator (74) injects pressurized water in the form of microscopic water droplets.
