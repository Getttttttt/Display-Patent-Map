abstract
    A method for improving the efficiency of a fired heater without an air preheat system is described. The method involves the use of an additional outboard convection section which is separate from the regular convection section of the fired heater. The outboard convection section uses the boiler feed water or an alternate cold sink to reduce the temperature of the flue gas, thereby improving the efficiency.
