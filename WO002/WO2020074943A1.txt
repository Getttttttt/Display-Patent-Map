abstract
    Plant for the treatment of multi-component waste with an organic matrix characterized in that it consists of at least one reactor composed by two concentric cylinders, heating means for the chamber formed in the innermost cylinder of said concentric cylinders being interposed in the cavity between the two said cylinders, means designed to ensure the formation of a synthesis gas and the separation of elementary solid substances being provided downstream of said reactor.
