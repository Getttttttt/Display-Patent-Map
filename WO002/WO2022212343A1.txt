abstract
    A powertrain for an electric vehicle has a driveshaft connected to two or more motors where each motor is connected to a battery pack associated with that motor. A controller is used to select one or more motors to be energized for propulsion or used for regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack to which it is coupled. The controller can optimize the state of charge (SOC) difference of the battery packs and provide for a smooth and efficient powering of the vehicle for acceleration and climbing and optimize the range of the vehicle by management of the relative SOC of the battery packs. The electric vehicle can include two or more fuel cells that individually coupled to a motor.
