abstract
    The invention relates to the supplemental generation of energy from operation of a train, and specifically to the generation of energy in connection to the rotation of disc brake rotors in combination with generators. Rotation of the disc brake rotors creates rotational energy that is transmitted to the generators, which then transmits the energy to a series of batteries for storage. The batteries may be stored in the platform for the train and/or within the train car itself. Energy from the batteries may be utilized by removal of the batteries from the train or through a number of outlets, sockets or connectors associated with the train car or platform.
