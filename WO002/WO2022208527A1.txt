abstract
    A Braking system for a vehicle A braking system and a method for braking in a vehicle is disclosed. The braking system includes a brake module, and an electronic control unit communicatively connected to the brake module. The electronic control unit is configured to activate the brake module only in a true braking event determined based on said one or more vehicle parameters. The braking system and the method provide high accuracy in braking events, high performance, comfort and improved braking ability to the rider while riding the vehicle.
