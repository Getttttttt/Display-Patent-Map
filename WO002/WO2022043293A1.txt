abstract
    The invention concerns a jet-engine comprising an outer casing having an opening end for allowing inlet gas to enter therein, a combustor system comprising a combustor container enclosing a combustor chamber, a hot gas combustor inlet for allowing gas to enter within the combustor chamber and a fuel combustor inlet for allowing fuel to enter within the combustor chamber. A first end of the combustor container is arranged in fluid communication with an end of the outer casing opposite its opening end. The jet engine further comprises a fuel cell system employed to heat compressed gas prior to entering the combustor chamber and to provide electric power to electric components.
