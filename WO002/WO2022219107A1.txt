abstract
    A system (1) for recovery of thermal energy from a heat source (2) comprising a heat source circuit (7a) with a first circulation fluid which receives thermal energy from the heat source (2), wherein the heat source (2) is connected to a heat receiver (5) comprising a heat receiver circuit (7b) with a second circulation fluid such that thermal energy may be transferred from the first circulation fluid to the second circulation fluid by means of a heat exchanger (4), the system comprising: an energy conversion module (3) configured to work in a closed loop thermodynamic cycle and convert thermal energy into electricity, wherein the energy conversion module (3) comprises a hot side arranged to be connected to the heat source circuit (7a) to extract thermal energy from the first circulation fluid, and a cold side arranged to be connected to the heat receiver circuit (7b) to deliver thermal energy to the second circulation fluid; and a flow control system arranged to control input and output of thermal energy into and out of the energy conversion module (3), wherein the flow control system comprises conduits for connecting the energy conversion module (3) to the heat source circuit (7a) and the heat receiver circuit (7b), and valves for selectively closing and opening the conduits to direct flow of the first and second circulation fluids therein.
