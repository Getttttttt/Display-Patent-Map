abstract
    A method for controlling an articulated vehicle combination (100, 500, 600) comprising a plurality of self-powered vehicle units (110, 120, 130, 140), wherein each self-powered vehicle unit (110, 120, 130, 140) comprises a propulsion device (230, 270, 720) and a regenerative braking device (230, 270, 710) connected to an energy source (210, 250, 725), the method comprising determining (S1) a current state of charge associated with an energy source of a target vehicle (202) unit comprised in the plurality of self-powered vehicle units (110, 120, 130, 140), and if the current state of charge is below a desired state of charge, generating (S5) a negative torque (M2) by the regenerative braking device (270) of the target vehicle unit (202), and compensating (S6) at least partly for the generated negative torque (M2) by generating a positive torque (M1) by the propulsion device (230) of at least one source vehicle unit (201) comprised in the plurality of self-powered vehicle units (110, 120, 130, 140), thereby transferring an amount of energy from the energy source of the at least one source vehicle unit (201) to the energy source of the target vehicle unit (202).
