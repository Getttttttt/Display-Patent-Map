abstract
    A drive train for installation in a vehicle chassis includes a power source, two motor/generators (M/Gs), an array of batteries, and a control system for configuring the drive train to operate using only the power source, only the batteries or a combination of the power source and batteries. The control system may open or close clutches to configure the drive train with each M/G working as a motor or a generator. A M/G working as a motor may use power from the batteries to supply rotational power to drive the vehicle or operate accessories on the vehicle. A M/G working as a generator coupled to a power source generates electric power for charging the array of batteries. The vehicle, including components and subsystems, may be powered electrically from the batteries or powered from the engine.
