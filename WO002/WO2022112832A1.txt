abstract
    Electric power generating home/office incinerator configured to generate electricity from the heat in the incinerator. As fig.4 disposed plurality of peltiers (14) around in the incinerator just inner layer of the outer aluminum sheet (6) and other side on the hot plate at air gape (15), a concrete wall (16) separates air gape and burning area. So the different temperature get in peltiers sides and produce an electricity. The temperature of the air gape (15) controls by microprocessor (9) to protect peltiers don't damaged by overheat (14) and microprocessor control the flow pump (7) to flow liquid in both coiled hollow tube (4) in the concrete (16) and storage liquid tank (19) to exchange heat and stores the excess heat in both concrete and the liquid. The stored heat helps to continue produce electricity for many hours at no burn.
