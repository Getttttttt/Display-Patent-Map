abstract
    The present disclosures relate to methods and systems for a hybrid powertrain. The hybrid powertrain system includes an integrated axle configured to provide mechanical power to a first pair of wheels, the integrated axle comprising a first motor-generator and a first drive axle such that the first motor-generator and at least a portion of the first drive axle are mechanically coupled to a common housing. The system also includes a second motor-generator configured to be mechanically coupled with an engine via a first clutch and mechanically coupled with a second drive axle via a second clutch, the second drive axle mechanically coupled with a second pair of wheels. A controller is electrically coupled with the first and second motor-generators, the engine, and the first and second clutches, the controller configured to enable a fully electric mode, a series hybrid mode, a parallel hybrid mode, and a regenerative mode of operation.
