abstract
    A vehicle system includes an engine, a transmission, a differential, and a waste heat recovery (WHR) drive that converts thermal energy into mechanical and electrical energy. The WHR drive can include a WHR power unit structured to convert thermal energy into rotation of a WHR drive shaft. A motor/generator having a motor/generator shaft can selectively operate as a motor or a generator. A mechanical linkage is structured to selectively link an output shaft to one of the WHR drive shaft and the motor/generator drive shaft independently of the other of the WHR drive shaft and the motor/generator drive shaft. The output shaft is selectively coupled to one of the engine, the transmission, or the differential. The vehicle system may also include a traction motor to provide drive to the vehicle. The output shaft can be selectively coupled to the traction motor or the engine.
