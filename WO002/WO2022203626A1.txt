abstract
    It relates to at least one heat recovery system (30) that can allow the waste heat emitted to the environment from a engine (10) that can move a vehicle (1) to be taken and made available again, thereby increasing the efficiency and comfort of the vehicles. The novelty of the invention is that it is characterized in that it comprises at least one heat exchanger (31) capable of transferring heat from a first fluid heated by the engine (10) to at least one second fluid, at least one turbine (32) capable of obtaining motion energy from the second fluid pressurized by heating in said heat exchanger (31), at least one condenser (33) capable of discharging the heat of the second fluid exiting said turbine (32) and transferring it back to the heat exchanger, and at least one alternator (40) capable of converting the motion energy obtained from the turbine (32) into electrical energy.
