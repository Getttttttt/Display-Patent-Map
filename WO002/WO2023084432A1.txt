abstract
    An electric or hybrid electric-endothermic traction system, comprises an electric machine (2), an inverter (5), a battery pack (Batt), and a switching device (4) connected to the electric machine (2) and configured to switch it between a low-speed configuration, wherein the stator windings (3) assume a first electric configuration, and a high-speed configuration, wherein the stator windings (3) assume a second electric configuration, wherein the first electric configuration of the stator windings (3) determines a voltage induced by the rotation of the rotor (BEMF1 ) that, on reaching a pre-determined threshold value (ω_th) of the angular velocity of the rotor (2b), exceeds a supply voltage of the battery pack (V_batt), while the second electric configuration of the stator windings (3) determines a voltage induced by the rotation of the rotor (BEMF2) that is lower than the voltage of the battery pack (V_batt) for any angular velocity within a field of use of the electric machine (2). The switching device (4) is configured to impart to the stator (2a) a switching from the low-speed configuration to the high-speed configuration when the rotor (2b) reaches a switching speed that is lower than or equal to the threshold value (ω_th).
