abstract
    A combined boiler for the supply of hot water and steam is described. The boiler is an electrode boiler with separate outputs for hot water and steam. The electrode boiler comprises a container (1), with a vessel (2) mounted inside the container (1), several electrodes (4) projecting into the vessel (2), the electrodes (4) being connected to a source for high voltage current, as well as a pump (6) arranged to pump water from the bottom of the container (1) via an outlet pipeline (7) and up into the tank (2) via an inlet pipeline (8). The changeover between steam and hot water mode takes place with a control system (9). In addition, the boiler is equipped with a source (14) for the supply of nitrogen. This is used in hot water mode, while the nitrogen source is disconnected when the boiler is run in steam mode.
