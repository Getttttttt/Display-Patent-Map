abstract
    A building heating or cooling system is disclosed that includes an air handling system comprising an air delivery flow path (44) in fluid communication with a conditioned space (40) in the building. The building heating or cooling system also includes an electrocaloric heating or cooling system (10, 11) that includes first and second modules (12, 14). A first inlet receives air from the conditioned space (40) or the air delivery flow path (44) and directs it through the first or second module (12, 14) to a first outlet to the conditioned space (40) or the air delivery flow path (44), and a second inlet that receives air from conditioned space (40) or the air delivery flow path (44) and directs it through the first or second module (12,14) to a second outlet to outside the conditioned space (40).
