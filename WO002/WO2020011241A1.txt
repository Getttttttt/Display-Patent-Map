abstract
    Downhill charge sustain battery protection strategy is disclosed. For one example, a vehicle is powered by an electric motor and battery. The vehicle includes a vehicle control unit (VCU) to control friction braking and regenerative braking for the vehicle. For one example, the VCU is configured to implement a method comprising detecting a condition to switch back and forth between regenerative braking and friction braking. For one example, the detected condition is a charge sustain event such as, for example, the vehicle being at a top of a hill or going down a hill in a lift condition (no pedals pressed) and the battery is fully charged at maximum state of charge (SOC) or voltage limit.
