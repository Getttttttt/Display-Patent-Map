abstract
    A combustion unit for a boiler comprising: a) a burner box forming a burn chamber in which fuel may be burned, the burner box comprising a base plate, b) a spray nozzle which is connectable to a fuel source and an oxygen source, c) an antechamber projecting from the burner box on the opposite side to the base plate, d) the spray nozzle being arranged in the antechamber, the tip of the spray nozzle extending into the burner box, the tip of the nozzle comprising an orifice, and wherein the orifice is positioned at a distance H from the base plate, the distance H being 90 to 540 times the diameter of the orifice. A boiler comprising at least one heat transfer box comprising at least one heat transfer chamber is disclosed.
