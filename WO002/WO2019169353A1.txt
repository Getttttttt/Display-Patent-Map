abstract
    Various embodiments of an enclosure system for housing a heat conversion system is disclosed. According to one exemplary embodiment, the enclosure system may include a first enclosure configured to receive a first component of the heat conversion system and a second enclosure configured to receive a second component of the heat conversion system. The first enclosure may include an upper connector and a lower connector, where the first enclosure may be connected to a first side structure of the locomotive via the lower connector of the first enclosure. The second enclosure may include an upper connector and a lower connector, where the second enclosure may be connected to a second side structure of the locomotive opposite to the first side structure via the lower connector of the second enclosure. The enclosure system may further include a connecting rod connecting between the upper connector of the first enclosure and the upper connector of the second enclosure.
