abstract
    Aspects of the present invention relate to a control system (208) and method for controlling energy management of a traction battery (200) of a hybrid electric vehicle (10), the traction battery (200) configured to power at least one traction motor (212) coupled to an electric-only axle (213) of the vehicle (10) to provide all-wheel drive, the control system (208) comprising one or more electronic controllers (300), the one or more electronic controllers (300) configured to: determine a change of terrain mode and/or type for the vehicle and/or determine an increase in loading of the vehicle (10); select an energy management control strategy for the traction battery (200) of the vehicle (10) in dependence on the determined change in terrain mode and/or type and/or the determined increase in loading of the vehicle (10), wherein the traction battery (200) is configured to supply power to the at least one traction motor (212) to provide torque to the electric-only axle (213) of the vehicle (10) to enable the vehicle (10) to operate in an all-wheel drive mode, wherein selecting an energy management control strategy of the vehicle (10) comprises at least one of: selecting or adjusting a charge sustain set point (30) for the traction battery (200); and changing energy generation to recharge the traction battery (200).
