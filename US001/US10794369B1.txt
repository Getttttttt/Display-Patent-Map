abstract
    A solar powered closed loop system and method for powering a cooling unit. The system and method provide a fully closed system that harnesses the power of the sun with a solar energy collecting device to generate vapor. The vapor has characteristics of high energy, expansion, and compressibility that enable travel through a plurality of conduits in the closed loop. The system generates vapor, carries the vapor and resultant gas, expands energy, and produces condensate through use of: a vapor expander, a compressor, a gas-liquid heat exchanger, an accumulator, an air-to-air heat exchanger, and a vapor condenser. Thus, through expansion, compression, and conversion different states of the vapor are controllably generated and disbursed for work. The work generated from the expansion and energy release from the vapors and gases produces work for powering the air-to-air heat exchanger, such as a cooling unit, and driving a load.
