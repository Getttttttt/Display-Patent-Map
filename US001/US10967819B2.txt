abstract
    A vehicle includes power outlets configured to receive power from an inverter. The vehicle includes power sources configured to supply power to the inverter and a plurality of electrical systems. A controller is programmed to, responsive to detecting a load connected to one of the power outlets, change a maximum power limit of the electrical systems by an amount associated with the one of the power outlets.
