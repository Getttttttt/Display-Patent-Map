abstract
    An improved HVAC system and method for simultaneously controlling the temperature and humidity of an indoor space while providing high quantities of outdoor air is described herein. The HVAC system of the present invention utilizes a heating source positioned in the supply passageway between an energy recovery wheel and a dehumidification wheel in order to control the temperature and humidity of air supplied to the indoor space while preventing frost build-up on the energy recover wheel. By positioning a heating source between the energy recovery wheel and a dehumidification wheel, the system is able to prevent frost accumulation on the energy recovery wheel during winter operation while also increasing the relative humidity of the supply air.
