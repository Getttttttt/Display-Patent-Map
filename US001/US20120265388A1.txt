abstract
    A vehicle equipped for power take off operation using direct application of power from a hybrid electric powertrain. A body computer connects to the controller area network to receive chassis input signals. A controller area network has an electronic control module, a transmission control module, and a hybrid control module. The electronic control module electrically connects to the transmission control module and the hybrid control module. A data link based remote power module is installed on the vehicle for generating body demand signals for initiating operation of the vehicle hybrid electric powertrain for a power take off operation. A plurality of PTO request switches are electrically connected to the controller area network. The body computer is programmable to accept a signal from at least one of the PTO request switches to change an operating state of the power take off operation.
