abstract
    Provided is a load driving device capable of efficiently recovering and using regenerative power and an inverted type movable body equipped with same. The load driving device includes a battery that supplies power to a load when driving the load, and is charged with a part of regenerative power when the regenerative power equal to or higher than a first reference value is generated by the load. The load driving device also includes an internal circuit that consumes at least a part of regenerative power when the regenerative power is generated by the load.
