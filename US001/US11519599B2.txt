abstract
    The invention discloses an opposed-injection aluminum melting furnace uniform combustion system which comprises: a furnace body, a first heat storage unit, a second heat storage unit, and four fuel injection guns disposed diagonally on two end walls of the furnace body comprising a first fuel injection gun located on the first end wall of the furnace body adjacent to the second heat storage unit, a second fuel injection gun located on the second end wall of the furnace body adjacent to the first heat storage unit, a third fuel injection gun on the second end wall of the furnace body adjacent to the second heat storage unit, and a fourth fuel injection gun located on the first end wall of the furnace body adjacent to the first heat storage unit, the gas injection direction of the first fuel injection gun is parallel with that of the second fuel injection gun with a spacing H between the axes thereof, the gas injection direction of the third fuel injection gun is parallel with that of the fourth fuel injection gun, with a spacing H between the axes thereof, and the spacing H between the axes is set to a quarter to one tenth of the furnace body width, such that the gas entering the chamber are oppositely-injected to form a swirling flow.
