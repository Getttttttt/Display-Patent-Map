abstract
    A method and apparatus for delivering power to a hybrid vehicle is disclosed. The apparatus includes an apparatus for delivering power to a hybrid vehicle, the hybrid vehicle including a powertrain having a power take-off coupling, the powertrain including an engine and a transmission. The apparatus includes an electric motor operable to generate a torque, the motor being coupled to transmit a starting torque through the power take-off of the powertrain for starting the engine.
