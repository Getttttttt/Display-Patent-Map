abstract
    A hybrid vehicle including one or more in-wheel motors, a power electronics supplying power to the one or more in-wheel motors, and a Rankine cycle system is described. The Rankine cycle system includes a pump driving a working fluid through the Rankine cycle system, a heat exchanger receiving the working fluid from to the pump and connected to the power electronics to cool the power electronics, an evaporator heating the working fluid received from the heat exchanger utilizing heat from an exhaust gas from an engine, an expander receiving the working fluid from the evaporator, and a radiator cooling the working fluid received from the expander.
