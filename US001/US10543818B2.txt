abstract
    The embodiments of the present application disclose a stability control system and a stability control method for a four-wheel drive electric vehicle and the four-wheel drive electric vehicle. In the stability control system, when the lateral acceleration is equal to or greater than an acceleration threshold, at least one of a first braking force signal, a second braking force signal, a first logic signal and a second logic signal is obtained. When the first logic signal is obtained, the body of the electric vehicle is controlled to keep stable. When the first braking force signal and the second logic signal are obtained, a motor is controlled to apply braking force to an outside front wheel. When the second braking force signal and the second logic signal are obtained, motors are controlled to apply braking force to the outside front wheel and an inside rear wheel.
