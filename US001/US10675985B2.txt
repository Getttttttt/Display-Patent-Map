abstract
    A fuel cell system mounted on a vehicle includes a drive motor generating a driving force and regenerative power; an auxiliary machine consuming the regenerative power; and a controller. The controller determines that the vehicle is in a first state when the vehicle has a negative vehicle speed, a move forward request is given to the vehicle and an accelerator pedal is depressed or when the vehicle has a positive vehicle speed, the move backward request is given to the vehicle and the accelerator pedal is depressed. When a predetermined first condition including a condition that the vehicle is in the first state is satisfied, the controller performs an auxiliary machine consumption process that causes the auxiliary machine to consume the regenerative power that includes a required power for the drive motor calculated by using a depression amount of the accelerator pedal.
