abstract
    The present disclosure discloses an HCCI air intake system for HEV, wherein the air outlet of the compressor is simultaneously connected to a hot channel and a cold channel, the hot channel is connected to the cylinder of the HCCI gasoline engine via the electrical drive system, coolant heat exchanger, engine exhaust heat exchanger and a throttle valve, while the cold channel is directly connected to the cylinder of the HCCI gasoline engine via another throttle valve. The hot channel is provided with at least one bypass valve for discharging air. The present disclosure makes the best use of the features of the electrical drive system and the HCCI gasoline engine in the HEV to make them technically work with each other, and provides a united air circulation system to meet the need to cool down the electrical drive system while controlling the air intake temperature of the engine cylinder, thereby overcoming the difficulty in maintaining the temperature level caused by the fact that the HCCI gasoline engine in the HEV has to be shut down intermittently. The present disclosure, in combination with its controlling method, may decrease even further, with relatively lower cost, the mean gasoline consumption and exhaust discharge of vehicles.
