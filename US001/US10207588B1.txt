abstract
    The vehicle turbine charging system is adapted for use with a vehicle. The vehicle is further defined with one or more body panels, a brake system, and an electrical system. The electrical system is further defined with a brake signal and a battery. The vehicle turbine charging system is a regenerative braking device. The operation of the vehicle turbine charging system is initiated upon the application of the brake system on the vehicle. The vehicle turbine charging system comprises one or more regeneration devices. Each individual regeneration device selected from the one or more regeneration devices diverts air flow from around the vehicle through the turbine. The turbine powers the regeneration circuit to provide electrical energy that recharges battery. The control circuit opens and closes the intake that diverts the air flow to the turbine. The intake is open during brake system operation and is otherwise closed.
