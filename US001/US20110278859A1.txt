abstract
    In one general embodiment, a system includes a working fluid operable to be circulated through a working cycle. The working cycle includes one or more expander-generators driven by the working fluid to generate electrical power at a first condition; an evaporator heat exchanger; and a condenser heat exchanger. The system includes power electronics thermally coupled to a heat exchanger and adapted to convert the electrical power at the first condition to electrical power at a second condition; and a conduit in fluid communication with the working cycle and the heat exchanger. The conduit is adapted to circulate the working fluid through the heat exchanger such that heat generated by the power electronics is transferred to the working fluid.
