abstract
    A regenerative braking system separate from a friction braking system of a vehicle is disclosed. According to certain embodiments, the regenerative braking system may include at least one actuator and a controller. The controller may be configured to: determine whether an accelerator pedal is depressed; when the accelerator pedal is depressed, determine an amount of regenerative braking based on behavior of the accelerator pedal; when the accelerator pedal is not depressed, determine the amount of regenerative braking based on motion of the vehicle; and control the at least one actuator to generate the determined amount of regenerative braking.
