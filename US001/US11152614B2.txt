abstract
    An electric vehicle includes an electric drive component; a lithium titanate oxide battery pack comprising LTO battery cells; and a range extender. The range extender has a first state to deliver power to the electric drive component, a second state to charge the LTO battery pack, a third state to deliver power to the electric drive component and charge the LTO battery pack, and a fourth state in which it does not deliver power outward. The electric drive component has a first state to receive power delivered from the LTO battery pack, a second state to receive power delivered from the range extender, a third state to receiver power delivered from the LTO battery pack and the range extender, a fourth state to recover braking energy to charge the LTO battery pack, and a fifth state in which it does not receive power and does not recover the braking energy.
