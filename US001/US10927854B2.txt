abstract
    Electro-hydraulic work vehicle system having a hydraulic lift mechanism comprising a first electric machine, a first hydraulic machine operatively connected to the first electric machine. A load holding valve is switchable between a first position in which it retains pressurized fluid in the hydraulic lift mechanism and a second position in which it enables pressurized fluid to flow between the first hydraulic machine and the hydraulic lift mechanism. A pressure relief valve is switchable between a first, initial position in which it prevents pressurized fluid from flowing from the first hydraulic machine to the hydraulic tank and a second position in which it enables pressurized fluid to flow from the first hydraulic machine to the hydraulic tank. An hydraulic energy storage is hydraulically connected between the first hydraulic machine and the relief valve, wherein in decent mode of hydraulic lift mechanism, the hydraulic system is configured to supply pressurized fluid to the hydraulic energy storage and when the load-holding valve is at its second position and the pressure relief valve is at its first position, wherein pressurized fluid from the hydraulic lift mechanism is capable of driving the first hydraulic machine which can drive the first electric machine to create electricity that can be stored in the electrical energy storage, and/or is capable of charging the hydraulic energy storage.
