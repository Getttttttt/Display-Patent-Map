abstract
    A method of controlling brake power flow for a vehicle with an electrically variable transmission is provided. When the brake power exceeds a power absorption capability of the energy storage system, then vehicle conditions are evaluated to determine if control of an engine fan is allowable. When conditions allow for fan control then the remaining brake power is provided for operation of the engine fan. Any excess brake power is dissipated through the exhaust brake or used by other vehicle accessories.
