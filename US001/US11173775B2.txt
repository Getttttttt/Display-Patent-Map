abstract
    A vehicle having a traction battery with at least one cell includes a controller coupled to the traction battery and programmed to modify traction battery current in response to a difference between a lithium plating parameter target value and a lithium plating parameter actual value to reduce the difference. The lithium plating parameter or indicator may be based on a differential open circuit voltage of a battery cell, or a ratio of differential voltage of the at least one cell as a function of time to cell charging rate of the at least one cell.
