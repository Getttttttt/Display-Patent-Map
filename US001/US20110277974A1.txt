abstract
    A condensing heat exchanger (100, 100 a) is disclosed that includes a pair of opposing half shells (145, 145 a) connected together. The half shells (145, 145 a) define an inlet (111) at one end and at least one outlet (112, 113) at an opposing end of the heat exchanger. The pair of opposing half shells (145, 145 a) also defines a central axis (133). Each half shell (145, 145 a) includes a plurality of elongated angled beads (117, 117 a,  119) that extend inwardly towards the other half shell. The elongated angled beads (117, 117 a , 119) of each half shell (145, 145 a) extend traversely across the central axis (133) at an angle Î¸ with respect to the central axis (133). The beads of one half shell (145, 145 a) also extend traversely across one or more beads of the other half shell. The half shells (145, 145 a) form two side channels (121, 121 a , 122, 122 a) for collecting condensate disposed opposite the plurality of elongated angled beads (117, 117 a,  119) from one another and between the inlet (111) and at least one outlet (112, 113).
