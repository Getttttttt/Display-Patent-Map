abstract
    In described embodiments, a battery car employed in conjunction with a battery car station employs a swappable battery configuration. Batteries are of differing types depending on provision of high current or high voltage, with each having a energy sensor. Access to the batteries of differing types is controlled through a switch control processor selectively coupling batteries to one or more power grids depending upon a given battery's sensed energy. Access to the batteries of differing types is based on demands of vehicle operation. Based on such configuration, a swappable battery car station in communication with the battery car might then selectively replace batteries as needed.
