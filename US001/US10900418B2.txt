abstract
    A combined cycle power plant that includes a gas turbine and HRSG engaged with a steam turbine via a water steam cycle having higher and lower pressure levels. The CCPP further includes a fuel line and fuel preheater. A higher pressure feedwater line delivers higher pressure feedwater to a higher pressure feedwater branch that extends through the fuel preheater, the high pressure feedwater branch including upstream and downstream segments defined to each side of the fuel preheater. A lower pressure feedwater line delivers lower pressure feedwater to a lower pressure feedwater branch. The downstream segment of the higher pressure feedwater branch is combined with the lower pressure feedwater branch at a junction point and a combined feedwater line extends therefrom. A first heat exchanger exchanges heat between the combined feedwater line and fuel line. A second heat exchanger exchanges heat between the higher pressure feedwater branch and fuel line.
