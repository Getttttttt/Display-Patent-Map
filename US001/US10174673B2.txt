abstract
    A portable green power system is disclosed that is capable of generating electric power based on green technologies (i.e., environmentally friendly) of high performance, low emissions, and low noise. The portable power system consists of three key design features including a free-floating shaft, an electric motor assisted airblast injector and four concentric channel flows. The engine is partitioned into separate channels or passages for the compressed air, hot gases, recuperation, and the engine case and are organized into four concentric channels for portable design and easy maintenance considerations. The concentric channel design also facilitates fully developed flow in each channel for reduction of vibration and noise. The four concentric channels include turbine concentric channel, compressor concentric channel, recuperator concentric channel and engine case concentric channel. Two-way bypass rings are used for cross flows among these concentric channel flows.
