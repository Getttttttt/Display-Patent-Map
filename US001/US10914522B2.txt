abstract
    In a method for reducing the NOx emissions of a rotary kiln of a clinker production plant, fuel supplied through a burner of the rotary kiln is burned along with primary air fed through the burner, wherein the primary air has a lower oxygen content and the primary air has an oxygen content reduced relative to that of the ambient air and a temperature increased relative to that of the ambient air, and the primary air is obtained by mixing ambient air with exhaust gas from the rotary kiln or from a heat exchanger connected to the rotary kiln and used for preheating raw meal. The primary air is further obtained by mixing with hot air, in particular waste air from a clinker cooler.
