abstract
    An integrated process for operating a fossil fuel fired power plant including: producing hydrogen gas and an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide via a process including: dissociating hydrogen gas and oxygen gas from water; pressurizing the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas; and mixing, under pressure, the oxygen gas and at least about a stoichiometric portion of the hydrogen gas with an aqueous solution of a catalyst and a promoter to form the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide; supplying a remainder of the hydrogen gas to at least one of (a) a storage means, (b) a boiler detonation cleaning system of the fossil fuel fired power plant, and (c) an electrical generator of the fossil fuel fired power plant; and injecting the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide into an air pollution control system of the fossil fuel fired power plant.
