abstract
    A machine and process for production of a fibrous web, with a forming section (2) in which the web is formed from a pulp suspension on a fabric (3) and with a final drying unit (4). In at least one further drying step, a rotatable dryer (5) with a hood (6) is located after the forming section (2) and before the final drying unit (4). The additional dryer (5) has a gas-impermeable exterior surface (7) which is directly heated by a combustion unit such a gas or oil fired burner (9).
