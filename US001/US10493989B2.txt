abstract
    A method of guiding a coasting time point of a vehicle includes steps of detecting occurrence of an upcoming deceleration event, determining driver's coasting characteristics for each deceleration event based on information of the detected occurrence of an upcoming deceleration event and a vehicle driving state, and determining a coasting guidance time point based on a determined result of coasting characteristics corresponding to a type of the detected deceleration event. The method provides, to a driver, information of a time point at which the driver needs to release an accelerator pedal operation, in order to begin coasting at an appropriate time point when a deceleration situation is assumed to lie ahead.
