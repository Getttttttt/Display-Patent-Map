abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery system includes an evaporator, an expander, a condenser, a pump, a circulation flow path, a cooling medium pipe, a bypass pipe, a first valve, a second valve for switching between a state in which the working medium can flow into the coolie medium piping and a state in which the working medium cannot flow therein, and a controller for performing the switching control of the valves. When a condition under which the temperature of the working medium flowing into the condenser becomes higher than or equal to a predetermined temperature is satisfied, the controller controls the second valve to switch to the state in which the working medium can flow into the cooling medium pipe.
