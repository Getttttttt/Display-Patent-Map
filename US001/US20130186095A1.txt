abstract
    A gas turbine prime mover for stationary and motor vehicle application. The gas turbine employs jet compression energized by a pressurized motive fluid to entrain a depressurized suction fluid from the turbine discharge. Combined suction and motive fluids circulate through the combustor or other heating source and the turbine while motive fluid, separated from the turbine discharge, preheats pressurized motive fluid in a heat recovery recuperator or regenerator. Additional features include recovery of heat loss from heating source loss and sub-ambient compression cooling of motive fluid. Cycle efficiency of 70% is attained.
