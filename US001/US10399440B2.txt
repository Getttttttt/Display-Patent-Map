abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for operating a hybrid vehicle during operating conditions where vehicle braking is requested. In one example, regenerative braking is permitted during conditions of wheel slip so that a greater portion of a vehicle's kinetic energy may be recovered and stored as electrical energy. Additionally, in some examples, the amount of regenerative braking is adjusted responsive to a torque of a differential clutch during wheel slip conditions.
