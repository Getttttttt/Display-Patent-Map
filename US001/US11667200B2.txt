abstract
    A control device for a vehicle includes an operation unit, an operation-unit sensor, a motor, and a driving force controller. The operation-unit sensor is configured to detect an operation-unit operation amount. The operation-unit operation amount is an amount of operation of the operation unit. The motor is capable of generating a negative driving force for decelerating the vehicle. The driving force controller is configured to cause the motor to drive a wheel of the vehicle with the negative driving force on a basis of the operation-unit operation amount, and to derive the negative driving force in accordance with an initial time change. The initial time change represents an amount of change in the operation-unit operation amount per unit time relative to an operation-unit operation amount at an initial position of the operation unit.
