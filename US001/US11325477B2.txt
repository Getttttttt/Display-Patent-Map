abstract
    An electrical brake energy feedback system, including a rectifier and inverter circuit, an intermediate DC circuit, a first voltage detection circuit configured to detect voltages of positive and negative terminals of the intermediate DC circuit to obtain a first voltage signal, a bidirectional DC/DC conversion circuit and/or a regeneration control circuit, and an electrical energy flow control circuit for controlling operating states of the bidirectional DC/DC conversion circuit and/or the regeneration control circuit according to the first voltage signal. With this system, the electrical brake energy can be recovered to the greatest extent when the vehicle is running in different zones, and the electrical brake energy consumed by the brake resistor is as little as possible. Accordingly, the vehicle and the entire transportation system can be more energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
