abstract
    A system for, and method of, monitoring and reporting ERV power consumption and service and maintenance needs. In one embodiment, the system includes: (1) a processor configured to carry out a plurality of monitoring and reporting functions related to ERV power consumption and service and maintenance needs based on a model, and types and locations of sensors, of the ERV, (2) a memory coupled to the processor and configured to store data gathered from the sensors and (3) a commissioning database associated with the memory and configured to contain commissioning data regarding the model of the ERV and the service and maintenance needs.
