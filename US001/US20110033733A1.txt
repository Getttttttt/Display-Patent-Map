abstract
    The present invention is a dual configuration rechargeable battery for an electric powered vehicle where the battery in a first configuration provides a first chemical reaction discharging a battery electrolyte to generate an electrical current and with a reverse current, recharging the battery; and in a second configuration provides a second chemical reaction to generate a reverse electrical current and recharging the battery so that the battery returned to the first configuration is charged. The chemical for the second reaction is depleted and must be replenished to repeat the cycle. The battery in the second configuration provides both the recharging of the electrolyte and an electrical current for an electric powered vehicle while recharging. The charging current are equivalent to the discharging current so that the battery can be designed for operational current and not higher charging currents. Unlike recharging from an external source such as the power grid, the battery is used while recharging.
