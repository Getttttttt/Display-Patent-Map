abstract
    A vehicle drive system that ensures brake force in the event of failure of a brake device or a controller. In vehicle drive system, a first brake device applies a brake torque to a pair of front wheels and a second brake device applies a brake torque to a pair of rear wheels. A first brake system includes a first controller and the first brake device, and a second brake system includes a second controller and the second brake device. In the event of occurrence of failure in one of the first brake system and the second brake system, only the other brake system generates brake torque.
