abstract
    A method for controlling the regenerative braking torque of a vehicle having a data processing unit for detecting a first information representing a deceleration request of the vehicle, detecting a second information representing a speed of the vehicle, and a first moving member of the vehicle and a second moving member of the vehicle. The method includes determining temperatures of different braking components on different axles, as well as the state of a battery module and a traction and regenerative braking module. The method also includes determining a regenerative braking power dynamic distribution ratio between the first and second axles. A regenerative braking torque is provided to one of the modules.
