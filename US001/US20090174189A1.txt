abstract
    A system for generating electricity from the rotational movement of wheels of a vehicle incorporates a turbine assembly, a wheel assembly, and an apparatus for storing electricity. The turbine assembly is disposed within the wheel assembly. The turbine assembly is connected to the apparatus for storing electricity thereby supplying the apparatus for storing electricity with electricity produced by the rotational movement of the wheel. The turbine assembly is comprised of a hollow rotor and a stator. The stator is disposed longitudinally within the hollow rotor.
