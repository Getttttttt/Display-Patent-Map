abstract
    Certain aspects of a natural gas liquid fractionation plant waste heat conversion to potable water using modified multi-effect distillation system can be implemented as a system that includes a waste heat recovery heat exchanger network thermally coupled to multiple heat sources of a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) fractionation plant. The heat exchanger network is configured to recover at least a portion of heat generated at the multiple heat sources. The system includes a sub-system thermally coupled to the waste heat recovery heat exchanger network to receive at least a portion of heat recovered by the heat exchanger network. The sub-system is configured to perform one or more operations using at least the portion of heat recovered by the heat exchanger network.
