abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for electrically-assisted engine braking. In one example, a method may include operating a turbocharger by an electric motor during engine braking to increase air flow to an engine intake. The enhanced air flow into the engine intake increases an exhaust manifold pressure, thus increased a braking force provided by engine braking.
