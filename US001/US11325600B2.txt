abstract
    The present invention provides a vehicle control method capable of suppressing an increase in the frequency of stopping and restarting of the engine when the braking device is activated at the self-driving mode. When the operation mode is set as self-driving, the braking device is activated in accordance with a system deceleration request to keep an actual vehicle-speed at a target vehicle-speed or change the actual vehicle-speed at the target vehicle-speed or lower depending on environment surrounding the vehicle. Further, a braking amount is estimated, the braking amount is a magnitude of a braking force generated from the activated braking device. When the braking amount is an engine-stopping enabling threshold or more, enabling stopping is allowed. When the braking amount is less than the engine-stopping enabling threshold, enabling stopping is not allowed.
