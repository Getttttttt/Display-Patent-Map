abstract
    A method is disclosed for generating and distributing electric power for localized use. The method entails providing an enclosed building having an air conditioning and ventilation unit for supplying cooled air within the building, the unit including a closed loop circuit configured to operate a closed loop refrigeration cycle, including a compressor operable to compress a working fluid of the closed loop circuit. The method further includes engaging an internal combustion engine with the compressor and operating the internal combustion engine to drive the compressor, thereby transferring energy to the refrigeration cycle. The method may also involve engaging an electric motor with the compressor and operating the electric motor to drive the compressor, thereby transferring energy to the refrigeration cycle.
