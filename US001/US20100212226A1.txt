abstract
    A gasification facility includes an air separator and a high temperature gas cooler for cooling the gaseous products that are produced at the facility's gasifier. The high temperature gas cooler is configured and a method is provided to produce superheated steam that is used to generate electric power in a steam turbine to satisfy the power demands of at least the air separator. Alternatively, or in addition, the superheated steam can be employed to drive compressors at the air separator. The high temperature gas cooler can be further configured so that it produces only that quantity of superheated steam required for the steam turbine to power the gasification facility, including the air separator, or a quantity of superheated steam adequate for the steam turbine to both power the gasification facility, including the air separator, and provide electric power or superheated steam to other users.
