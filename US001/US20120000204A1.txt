abstract
    A method and apparatus are disclosed for a multi-spool gas turbine power plant which utilizes motor/generator devices on two or more spools for starting the gas turbine and for power extraction after starting. Methods are disclosed for controlling engine responsiveness under changing load and/or ambient air conditions; providing a momentary power boost when required; providing some engine braking when needed; providing over-speed protection for the free power turbine when load is rapidly lowered or disconnected; charging an energy storage system; and restoring the compressors and/or turbines toward their operating lines when surge or choking limits are approached.
