abstract
    An apparatus for controlling a towing mode of an electric vehicle is provided. The apparatus includes a first sensor that measures a speed of the electric vehicle and a second sensor that measures a gradient of a road on which the electric vehicle is driven. A controller detects a reference output of the electric vehicle based on the speed and the gradient of the road and detects a towing weight of the electric vehicle based on an excess rate of a current output with respect to the reference output. The towing mode of the electric vehicle is then executed based on the detected towing weight.
