abstract
    The present invention discloses a device and method for generating high-purity hydrogen by biomass pyrolysis-chemical looping combustion. The device comprises a biomass pyrolysis unit, a chemical looping hydrogen generation unit and a waste heat recovery unit; the biomass pyrolysis unit comprises a vertical bin, a screw feeder, a rotary kiln pyrolysis reactor and a high temperature filter; the chemical looping hydrogen generation unit comprises a path switching system of intake gas end, at least one packed bed reactor and a path switching system of tail gas end, wherein the packed bed reactor is composed of three parallel packed bed reactors I, II and III, which are continuously subjected to fuel reduction-steam oxidation-air combustion stages (steam purging stage) successively; the waste heat recovery unit comprises a waste heat boiler, a cooler and a gas-liquid separator. According to the present invention, a process flow of generating hydrogen from biomass is short, high-purity hydrogen can be obtained by simple condensation and water removal of a hydrogen-containing product that is generated after entrance of a pyrolysis gas into the chemical looping hydrogen generation unit, no complex gas purification device is employed, and the costs for hydrogen generation are low.
