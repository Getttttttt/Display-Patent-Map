abstract
    A method of generating electrical power includes expanding a flow of exhaust gas from a combustion process as the exhaust gas passes through a turbo-expander disposed on a turbo-crankshaft. The flow of exhaust gas from the turbo-expander is routed through a first flow path of an exhaust gas heat exchanger. The flow of exhaust gas from the first flow path is compressed as the exhaust gas passes through a turbo-compressor disposed on the turbo-crankshaft. The flow of exhaust gas from the turbo-compressor is routed through a second flow path of the exhaust gas heat exchanger. Heat from the first flow path is transferred to the second flow path to cool the exhaust gas in the first flow path and heat the exhaust gas in the second flow path. Electrical power is generated from a generator disposed on the turbo-crankshaft.
