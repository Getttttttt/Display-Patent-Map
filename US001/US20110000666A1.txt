abstract
    The device of the present invention belongs to the field of the steam generators devices. Specifically, the device described herein is based constructively in a rocket-type engine for generates instantaneously a vitiated steam, which is a mix of water steam with combustion gases. The device described herein is a modular device whose each module may be changed in case of break or clogging. The device of this invention provides energy for the operation of different steam equipment, such as turbines, engines, locomotives, among other possible, as well as the combination of them. The device of this invention may also be attached in petroleum wells, making feasible the extraction of petroleum from the mature wells.
