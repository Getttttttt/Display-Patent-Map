abstract
    A system for converting thermal energy from combusting fuel and air into work under an isochoric process. A reciprocating heat engine creates a cycle delay after combustion to enable sufficient time for thermal compression to occur within the working gas and within a constant volume to maximize thermal compression. A secondary engine also includes a cycle delay to maximize thermal compression of a working gas by recovering waste heat from the exhaust of the primary heat engine and converting a percentage of that heat energy into work. System cooling is accomplished under a thermodynamic cycle with heat from a liquid medium, such as water, passing through the internal combustion engine block or heat exchanger being conserved and applied to useful auxiliaries, such as residential hot water heating, baseboard heating, radiant floor heating.
