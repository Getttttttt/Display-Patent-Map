abstract
    A vehicle includes an energy harvesting system. The energy harvesting system includes a fluid, a heat engine, and a component. The fluid has a first fluid region at a first temperature and a second fluid region at a second temperature that is different from the first temperature. The heat engine is configured for converting thermal energy to mechanical energy and includes a shape-memory alloy disposed in contact with each of the first fluid region and the second fluid region. The component is driven by the heat engine in response to the temperature difference.
