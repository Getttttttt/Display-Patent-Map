abstract
    A distributed Biogas Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Generator can provide automatically hot water and electricity for local applications. Since biogas is produced by an anaerobic digester from human, animal, kitchen and agriculture's wastes, it is a short term recycled product from the photosynthesis of CO2, and has a net zero carbon emission. The sulfur compounds in the biogas can be removed by the following steps: (1), converting all sulfur compounds into H2S by the hydrogen produced from the biogas over Pt group metal catalysts; (2). adsorbing the H2S at high temperature by the regenerable Pt group metal catalyst and adsorbents. The desulfurized biogas is further converted by an ATR/CPO reformer or a steam generating reformer to produce various reformates, which can be connected to a downstream 1C engine/gas turbine, and/or a steam turbine to drive electric generators for generating electricity. The hot reformate and the exhaust gases can be cooled in heat exchangers to produce hot water/hot air.
