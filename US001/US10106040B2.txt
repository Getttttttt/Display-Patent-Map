abstract
    A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and methods for operation having a powertrain that includes an engine, an electric machine and storage battery, and a transmission coupled via a drive shaft to wheels having regenerative-friction brakes. The HEV and transmission incorporate regenerative and adaptive braking and a capability to detect nearby obstacles and other vehicles. Such controllers monitor and report the nearby-vehicle distance and a brake pedal tip-lift time and position. In response, the controller(s) cause the electric machine to generate electric power with negative torque, which decelerates the transmission and wheels at a constant or variable rate, adjusted so the nearby-vehicle distance during deceleration equals or exceeds a predetermined, lead-lag distance to nearby vehicles or obstacles. An adaptive cruise signal may also be generated that may indicate driver vehicle preferred settings and profiles, and constant, adjustable, learned, and driver selectable deceleration profiles, which are utilized to control deceleration during braking.
