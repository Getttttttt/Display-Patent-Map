abstract
    A power system having a DC electric motor is disclosed. The DC electric motor may include an armature and a field coil electrically connected in series with the armature, the field coil having an input and an output. The power system may also include an additional electrical path. Additionally, the power system may include one or more current-control elements that control one or more aspects of electrical activity in the additional electrical path, which may include, when inductance of the field coil generates a higher voltage at the output than at the input in response to a decrease in electric current through the field coil, allowing electric current to flow from the output, through the additional electrical path, to the input without flowing through the armature.
