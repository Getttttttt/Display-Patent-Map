abstract
    A heat exchanger for an engine is disclosed. The heat exchanger includes a vortex tube and a gas return path. Expansion media tubes, which have a working fluid therein, are located between the vortex tube and the gas return path. Hot gases in the vortex tube, along with warm gases in the return path, heat the working fluid. In one embodiment, the working fluid, is delivered to a cylinder in which it expands, so as to move a piston. In one embodiment, the working fluid is fuel. In one embodiment, after the working fluid expands in the cylinder, it is recovered and burned in a combustion chamber, which is in, fluid communication with the vortex tube. In one embodiment, the working fluid is water.
