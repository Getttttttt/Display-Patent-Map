abstract
    In one aspect, a controller for driving a motor of the present invention includes a driving control unit that controls driving of a motor, and a regenerative control unit that instructs the driving control unit to start regeneration when a signal from a pedal rotation sensor that detects a rotation direction of the pedal indicates that the rotation direction of the pedal is backwards, the regenerative control unit controlling an amount of the regeneration in accordance with a backward rotation amount of the pedal while the rotation direction of the pedal is backwards, the backward rotation amount being obtained by the pedal rotation sensor.
