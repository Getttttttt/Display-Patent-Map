abstract
    A method for executing regenerative braking of a mild hybrid system may include performing, when a brake is operated while a vehicle having the mild hybrid system is traveling, regenerative braking only in a state in which a wheel torque is greater than a clutch load torque by a threshold, thereby preventing occurrence of an abnormal engine-off state during regenerative braking.
