abstract
    Various examples are provided for cryogenic power extraction. In one example, among others, a system for cryogenic power extraction includes a heat exchanger that can heat a cryogenic working fluid using exhaust heat from a heat source, and a turbine that can generate power from the heated cryogenic working fluid. In another example, a method includes heating a cryogenic working fluid with waste heat from a heat source and driving a turbine with the heated cryogenic working fluid. Power produced by the turbine can be used drive a mechanical load and/or generate electricity for use by an electrical load. For example, waste heat from a combustion engine of a vehicle can be used to generate power for driving mechanical loads of the engine and/or to generate electricity for charging a battery of the vehicle.
