abstract
    A small supercritical once-through steam generator (OTSG) includes a radiant section with a furnace coil, and a convection section downstream of the radiant section that includes a superheater which is fluidically connected to the furnace coil. Optionally, the OTSG is devoid of a steam separator. An economizer can also be included downstream of the superheater. Supercritical steam can be generated using the OTSG, for use, among other things, in enhanced oil recovery applications.
