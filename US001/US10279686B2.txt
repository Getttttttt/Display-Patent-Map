abstract
    A locomotive regenerative electric energy feedback system with an ice melting function, comprising two regenerative electric energy feedback devices (1). A direct-current side positive electrode of the regenerative electric energy feedback device (1) is connected to a positive electrode bus of a subway traction network, wherein the positive electrode bus is connected to an uplink contact network and a downlink contact network respectively via a first switching switch (4) and a second switching switch (5). A direct-current side negative electrode of the regenerative electric energy feedback device (1) is connected to the downlink contact network or the uplink contact network via a third switching switch (2), and the direct-current side negative electrode is connected to a negative electrode bus of the subway traction network via a fourth switching switch (3). Further disclosed is a control method corresponding to the system. In the system and method, the ice melting function on a contact network circuit between two traction stations is achieved by means of switch switching and a control method for adjusting the regenerative electric energy feedback devices, and an original regenerative electric energy feedback device is used without adding an additional device, so that the reliability is high.
