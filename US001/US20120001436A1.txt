abstract
    An electric power generating system is provided that uses a wind turbine to generate waste-heat that is utilized in an organic Rankine Cycle drive that converts heat energy into rotation of a generator rotor for generating electricity. A hydrodynamic retarder may be provided that dissipates heat into a hot fluid by directing the flow of the fluid through the hydrodynamic retarder in a manner that resists rotation of blades of the wind turbine. The hot fluid circulating in the hydrodynamic retarder is a thermal heat source for vapor regeneration of organic heat exchange fluid mixture(s) used in the Rankine cycle, expansion of the organic heat exchange fluid being converted into rotation of the generator rotor.
