abstract
    Systems, methods, and devices are described with respect to storing energy in an electric vehicle. At least one coil winding located in a wheel assembly is provided, where the wheel assembly includes a tire and a rim. At least one charge storage device located in the wheel assembly is provided. At least one electrical storage unit located within the electric vehicle is provided, where an induced charge resulting from the at least one winding passing through an electromagnetic field is stored in the at least one charge storage device and transferred to the at least one electrical storage unit via the rim of the wheel assembly. Moreover, a charging capacity for the at least one charge storage device may change to cause the electric vehicle to slow.
