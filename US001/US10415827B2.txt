abstract
    An exhaust adapter secures an exhaust tube relative to an exhaust pipe. The exhaust adapter is formed to have an annular shape enclosing a through hole, and is mounted on the outer peripheral surface of the exhaust tube and on the inner peripheral surface of the exhaust pipe by inserting the exhaust tube into the through hole. When the exhaust adapter is being fitted on the outer peripheral surface of the exhaust tube, the inner peripheral surface of the exhaust adapter presses the outer peripheral surface of the exhaust tube, and when the exhaust adapter is being fitted on the inner peripheral surface of the exhaust pipe, the outer peripheral surface of the exhaust adapter presses the inner peripheral surface of the exhaust pipe.
