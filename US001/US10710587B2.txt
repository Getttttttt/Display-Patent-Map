abstract
    An electrically-driven mining vehicle includes an obstacle detector, a speed detector, and an alarm. The alarm outputs a first warning, which urges an operator of the electrically-driven mining vehicle to operate a regenerative brake pedal that actuates only the regenerative brake device, and a second warning, which urges the operator to operate a cooperative brake pedal that uses the regenerative brake device and the mechanical brake device in combination. If the travel speed of the vehicle is included in a low speed range in which no difference can be considered to exist in distance between a first braking distance upon actuation of only the regenerative brake device and a second braking distance upon operation of a cooperative braking, a signal for performing the first warning is outputted earlier by at least a warning time interval.
