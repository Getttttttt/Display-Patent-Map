abstract
    A vehicle includes a motor and a controller. The controller is programmed to, responsive to an autonomous braking request and a predicted average braking torque associated with the request having a magnitude less than a powertrain regenerative torque limit, brake the vehicle only with the motor according to a torque profile adapted from a most efficient torque profile of the motor so as to have an average value falling within a specified range of the average braking torque.
