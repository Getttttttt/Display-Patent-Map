abstract
    An energy storage and generation system for an electrically powered motorized vehicle is disclosed. In one embodiment, an energy storage and generation system for an electrically powered motorized vehicle includes a stator having field coils and sensors which are provided on the inner periphery of the stator, and a rotor having permanent magnets with N and S poles arranged alternately in a circumferential direction on the outer periphery to face the field coils and housing batteries of the electrically powered motorized vehicle. The energy storage and generation system also includes a drive control unit connected to the sensors and the field coils for generating magnetic field in the field coils of the stator in response thereto to rotate the rotor. The rotation of the rotor stores rotational kinetic energy due to the dead weight of the plurality of batteries which is used to propel the electrically powered motorized vehicle.
