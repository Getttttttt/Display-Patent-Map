abstract
    A regenerative braking control system for a motor-driven vehicle is configured to provide a continuous assistant braking force by continuous reverse torque of an electric motor by enabling surplus electrical energy produced by an electric motor to be easily converted into thermal energy in generative braking, using both of a brake resistor and a heater to convert electrical energy into thermal energy, and being able to obtain an interior heating effect by using thermal energy converted by the brake resistor and the heater as heat source for interior heating without discharging the thermal energy to the outside.
