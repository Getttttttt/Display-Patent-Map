abstract
    Recovering heat from a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) fractionation plant via a waste heat recovery heat exchanger network including heating a buffer fluid in a heat exchanger with a stream from the NGL fractionation plant and discharging the heated buffer fluid to an integrated triple cycle system. Generating cooling capacity for the NGL fractionation plant via the integrated triple cycle system with heat from the buffer fluid.
