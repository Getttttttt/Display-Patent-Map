abstract
    A method for operating a motor vehicle. At least one electric engine designed for driving the motor vehicle is used to recuperate electric energy. In this case, a travel of the motor vehicle during a period of time lying ahead is taken into account. During the use of at least one electric engine for recuperating the electric energy, it is taken into account whether during a thermal load of the at least one electric engine in the period lying ahead, a reduction of the power that can be output by at least one electric engine is to be expected. The at least one electric engine then recuperates an amount of electric energy during the deceleration of the motor vehicle which is smaller than the amount of electric energy that can be recuperated during the deceleration by the at least one electric engine. The invention relates in addition also to a motor vehicle.
