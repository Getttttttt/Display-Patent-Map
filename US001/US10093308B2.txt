abstract
    A vehicle electronic stability control system which allows a vehicle to have improved movement performance and limit performance without causing a driver to feel uncomfortable, by actuating electronic stability control from a state where a lateral slip is relatively less likely to occur. The system prevents a skid of a vehicle. The system is provided with a stability determination module that obtains information indicating vehicle behavior from a sensor, and determines whether the vehicle is in an unstable or less stable state, on the basis of the information. The system is further provided with a braking/driving force control module which, when the stability determination module determines that the vehicle is in the unstable or less stable state, applies a braking force to one of the drive wheels, and simultaneously applies a driving force to the motor for the other drive wheel.
