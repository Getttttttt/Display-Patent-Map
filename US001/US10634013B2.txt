abstract
    A proposed method provides a highly efficient fueled power output augmentation of the liquid air energy storage (LAES) through its integration with the semi-closed CO2 bottoming cycle. It combines the production of liquid air in air liquefier during LAES charge using excessive power from the grid and an effective recovery of stored air for production of on-demand power in the fueled supercharged reciprocating internal combustion engine (ICE) and associated expanders of the power block during LAES discharge. A cold thermal energy of liquid air being re-gasified is recovered for cryogenic capturing most of CO2 emissions from the facility exhaust with following use of the captured CO2 in the semi-closed bottoming cycle, resulting in enhancement of total LAES facility discharge power output and suppressing the thermal NOx formation in the ICE.
