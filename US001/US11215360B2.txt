abstract
    A method and device for drying wood chips to be used as raw material for a gas-generating reactor, the device being disposed between the storage for wood chips and the reactor. Product gas of the reactor is at least partially used in a block-type thermal power station (BHKW), and hot air from the housing of the block-type thermal power station is used to heat and dry wood chips in a drying hopper which has at least one outlet for the cooled humidified air. The wood chips enter the drying hopper through a first air-tight lock and exit the drying hopper through a second air-tight lock.
