abstract
    A method of operating an electrically powered rotorcraft of the type having a fuselage and a set of N rotors driven by a set of electric motors and coupled to the fuselage, Nâ‰¥4, under a failure condition preventing ordinary operation of the rotorcraft. The method includes entering a failsafe mode of operation wherein autorotation of at least four of the rotors is enabled. The method also includes using electrical braking associated with a selected group of the rotors to control yaw of the rotorcraft.
