abstract
    A hydraulic system for a machine is disclosed. The hydraulic system may have a pump, a tank, a first actuator with a head-end and a rod-end, and a first valve arrangement configured to control fluid flow from the pump to the first actuator and from the first actuator to the tank. The hydraulic system may also have a second actuator with a head-end and a rod-end, and a second valve arrangement configured to control fluid flow from the pump to the second actuator and from the second actuator to the tank. The hydraulic system may further have a third valve arrangement fluidly connected between the first and second valve arrangements to receive pressurized fluid from the pump in parallel with the first and second valve arrangements. The third valve arrangement may be configured to facilitate fluid regeneration of and supplemental flow to at least one of the first and second actuators.
