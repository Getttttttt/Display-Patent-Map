abstract
    A primary heat exchanger for a furnace includes one or more passes and having a heat exchanger height. A ratio of heat exchanger efficiency to heat exchanger height is in the range of about 7.0 points per inch to about 8.1 points per inch. A furnace includes a burner for combusting a fuel and a primary heat exchanger operably connected to the burner. The primary heat exchanger includes one or more passes and has a heat exchanger height. A ratio of heat exchanger efficiency to heat exchanger height is in the range of about 7.0 points per inch to about 8.1 points per inch.
