abstract
    A system and a method regulate temperature in a building using an air inlet at a level beneath a space for habitation within the building (e.g., living areas in a residential building, or work areas or offices in a commercial building). The air pulled into the air inlet creates an air flow into the building that is received into a thermal storage plenum, which allows the air flow to mix with a substantial air mass accumulated in the thermal storage plenum. The air in the thermal storage plenum is circulated throughout the space for habitation and recycled back to the thermal storage plenum through, for example, a return duct. Such a return duct may be provided by a stairwell. A relief vent may be provided at a level above the space for habitation for the air flow to exit the building. The quantity of air flowing through the air inlet and the relief vent may be controlled using a control system which open the air inlet and the relief vent simultaneously. The temperature of the air circulated in the space for habitation may be regulated by a roof-mounted heat pump.
