abstract
    A thermoelectric hydrogen hybrid vehicle for use with fossil fuel, the thermoelectric hydrogen hybrid vehicle has a closed loop steam engine. The steam engine's boiler is a high temperature electrolysis unit. Inside the internal combustion engines exhaust heat is directly funneled into heating the high temperature electrolysis boiler. The steam engines electrical current generated through an alternator is then stored in a battery bank and then used for sustained current for electrolysis in the high temperature electrolysis boiler. Furthermore a braking mechanism is hooked up to the alternator for electrical generation when braking to be stored in a battery bank which is then used for electrolysis.
