abstract
    A vehicle power supply system includes a first drive motor, a second drive motor, a first power line to which a first inverter and a first battery are connected, a second power line to which a second inverter and a second battery are connected, a voltage converter that convert a voltage between the power lines, and a charging and discharging control device that controls charging and discharging of the batteries and by operating the inverters and and the voltage converter. A vehicle is able to travel in a drive mode of any of an all-wheel drive mode and a two-wheel drive mode. The charging and discharging control device drives the first drive motor with power that is discharged from the first battery in a case where the drive mode is the two-wheel drive mode.
