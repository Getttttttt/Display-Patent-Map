abstract
    An integrated chemical looping combustion (CLC) electrical power generation system and method for diesel fuel combining four primary units including: gasification of diesel to ensure complete conversion of fuel, chemical looping combustion with supported nickel-based oxygen carrier on alumina, gas turbine-based power generation and steam turbine-based power generation is described. An external combustion and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) are employed to maximize the efficiency of a gas turbine generator and steam turbine generator. The integrated CLC system provides a clean and efficient diesel fueled power generation plant with high CO2 recovery.
