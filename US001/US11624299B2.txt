abstract
    Embodiments of the present disclosure can include a system for generating steam. The system can include a direct steam generator configured to generate saturated steam and combustion exhaust constituents. A close coupled heat exchanger can be fluidly coupled to the direct steam generator, the close coupled heat exchanger can be configured to route the saturated or superheated steam and combustion exhaust constituents through an exhaust constituent removal system. The system can include an energy recovery system that reclaims the energy from the exhaust constituents.
