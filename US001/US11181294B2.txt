abstract
    An air conditioning apparatus saves space, has a low cost and a high energy efficiency. In a former stage, total heat exchange is carried out in a total heat exchange rotor which performs heat exchange between the return air from the indoor space and outdoor air. A passive desiccant rotor, if provided, may eliminate a the need for a regenerative heat source in a latter stage. Latent heat exchange is performed in a heat pump circuit which exchanges heat between the outdoor air and the return air which have undergone total heat exchange. Further, the air conditioning apparatus may realize reduction of the total cost of equipment by eliminating the outdoor unit, and may realize reduction of on-site construction cost after the installation of the equipment and shortening of the construction term.
