abstract
    A performance learning system and method is provided for a utility vehicle. The performance learning system includes a propulsion system, a plurality of sensors disposed on the vehicle and capable of acquiring operational data associated with the vehicle, a processor, and a memory configured to store historical operational data. The processor can be configured to receive the operational data from the sensors, generate and transmit a command to control the propulsion system based on the operational data and the historical operational data, and update the historical operational data based on the operational data. The operational data may include characteristics associated with one or more of an operator of the vehicle or an operating environment of the vehicle. The systems and methods may optimize the performance of the utility vehicle for particular environments and conditions in which the utility vehicle is being operated and increase operator satisfaction.
