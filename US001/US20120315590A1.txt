abstract
    A method of operating a mineral processing kiln includes introducing a quantity of a selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) reducing agent into the kiln. The SNCR reducing agent may be a solid, liquid, or a gas. A mineral processing kiln modified for the implementation of SNCR is also disclosed.
