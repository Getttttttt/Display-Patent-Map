abstract
    A vehicle having a controller is provided. The controller may be configured to, responsive to identification of a braking event predicted to occur in the future, hydraulically charge an accumulator, and responsive to a pressure of the accumulator exceeding a first threshold, cease charging the accumulator, and satisfy transmission line pressure demand with pressure from the accumulator to begin depleting the accumulator to a before initiation of the braking event.
