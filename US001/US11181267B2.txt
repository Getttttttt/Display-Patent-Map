abstract
    Methods and systems for oxidizing gas are provided. An example regenerative oxidizer is provided that includes a combustion chamber to heat gas present in the combustion chamber. The regenerative oxidizer also includes a first heat exchange media bed and a second heat exchange media bed, each in fluid communication with the combustion chamber. The regenerative oxidizer also includes a rotary valve disposed at least partially between the first heat exchange media bed and the second heat exchange media bed. The rotary valve may alternate the flow of gas between a first and a second airflow direction. The first heat exchange media bed, the rotary valve, and the second heat exchange media bed are arranged with respect to each other such that the gas pathway between the first heat exchange media bed and the rotary valve and between the second heat exchange media bed and the rotary valve is non-linear.
