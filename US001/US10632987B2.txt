abstract
    The disclosure provides a driving device of a vehicle, wherein even if a power storage device is fully charged, the driving device is capable of applying a corresponding decelerating force to a driving wheel. The driving device of the vehicle includes a motor as a driving source, a first planetary gear mechanism connected to the motor, a second planetary gear mechanism connected to the first planetary gear mechanism, and a differential mechanism connected with driving wheels from the second planetary gear mechanism, and further includes a brake detachably connecting a ring gear of the second planetary gear mechanism to a fixed-side member, and a lock mechanism capable of locking the differential mechanism.
