abstract
    An apparatus for a hybrid machine is disclosed. The apparatus includes a fluid pump operably connected to a condenser and a fluid path operably connected to the fluid pump. The fluid receives thermal energy from a first machine component and a second machine component. The first machine component has a static operating temperature equal to or lower than the second machine component.
