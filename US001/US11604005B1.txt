abstract
    An in-line device for controlling a ventilation system for an enclosed space is featured. The ventilation system is configured to produce a first airflow from an external environment to the enclosed space and a second airflow from the enclosed space to the external environment. The in-line device includes a first electrical interface configured to connect to an electrical outlet, a second electrical interface configured to receive a power plug for the ventilation system, and a controller configured to control the ventilation system based on a first parameter of the first airflow and a second parameter of the second airflow.
