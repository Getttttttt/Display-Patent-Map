abstract
    A propulsion system is provided. The system includes: a first propulsion vehicle unit including a first tractive bank having at least one traction motor; a second propulsion vehicle unit including: a second tractive bank having at least one traction motor, a contactor electrically coupling the first propulsion vehicle unit and the second propulsion vehicle unit, and an electrical power modulation device coupled between the first tractive bank and the second tractive bank, the electrical power modulation device having an electrical current threshold that causes the electrical power modulation device to transition to an open state to reduce or prevent transfer of electrical power between the first propulsion unit and the second propulsion unit in response to an electrical current at the electrical power modulation device being above the electrical current threshold.
