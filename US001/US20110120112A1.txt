abstract
    An energy harvesting system includes a heat engine and a component. The heat engine includes first and second regions, a conduit, and a shape memory alloy (SMA) material. The conduit extends along a central axis. The SMA material surrounds the conduit and is disposed in one of the regions. The SMA material is radially spaced from a secondary axis that surrounds the central axis. A localized region of the SMA material changes crystallographic phase from martensite to austenite and contract in response to exposure to the first temperature. The localized region of the SMA material also changes crystallographic phase from austenite to martensite and expands in response to exposure to the second temperature. The SMA material rotates about the secondary axis in response to the contraction and expansion of the localized region of the SMA material. Rotation of the SMA material about the secondary axis drives the component.
