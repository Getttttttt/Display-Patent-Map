abstract
    To reduce energy consumption, a desiccant air-conditioning system is provided with: an air supply channel 1 that supplies outside air A1 that flows from the outside, to an object to be air-conditioned; an exhaust channel 2 that exhausts return air A2 that flows from the object to be air-conditioned, to the outside; a desiccant portion 10 that adsorbs moisture from the outside air A1 passing through the air supply channel 1, and that desorbs the adsorbed moisture to the return air A2 passing through the exhaust channel 2; a first cooling portion 31 which is installed between the desiccant portion 10 and the object to be air-conditioned in the air supply channel, and which cools the outside air A1; a second cooling portion 44 which is installed between the desiccant portion 10 and the first cooling portion 31 in the air supply channel, and which absorbs the heat from the outside air A1 to cool it; a heating portion 45 which is installed between the desiccant portion 10 and the object to be air-conditioned in the exhaust channel 2, and which heats the return air A2 up to at least the regeneration temperature at which the desiccant portion 10 desorbs the moisture; and a heat supplying portion 50 that supplies the heat absorbed from the outside air A1 by the second cooling portion 44, to the heating portion 45.
