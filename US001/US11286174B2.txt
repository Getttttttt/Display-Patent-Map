abstract
    The present invention provides a system for supplying heat by means of stratum coal in-place slurrying and a method for supplying power generation heat by means of stratum coal in-place slurrying, belonging to the technical field of ground-source well heat exchange. The system comprises a stratum coal slurrying device, a mid-deep well casing device and a heat exchange device. The stratum coal slurrying device comprises a water inlet pump and a coal slurry pump, which are connected to a directional slurry preparing drill through pipelines, respectively. The mid-deep well casing device comprises a vertically buried pipe, and a heat-insulating inner pipe that is coaxial with the vertically buried pipe and inserted into the vertically buried pipe. A microporous pipe assembly is arranged on the bottom of the heat-insulating inner pipe. An electric heater is arranged in the microporous pipe assembly, an annular cavity is formed between the vertically buried pipe and the heat-insulating inner pipe, and a power wire connected to the electric heater is arranged in the annular cavity. The coal slurry pump is connected to the annular cavity. The heat exchange device comprises a water outlet pipe that is inserted into the heat-insulating inner pipe and connected to the microporous pipe assembly. The present invention can directly combust the underground coal to generate heat energy to realize heat energy conversion, and the process is clean and harmless.
