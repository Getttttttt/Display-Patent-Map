abstract
    A ventilator (1) includes: an air supply fan (2) to supply outdoor air to a room; an air exhaust fan (3) to exhaust indoor air, out of the room; and a total heat exchanger (4) which is made with partition boards (41) being moisture-permeable flat parts and with spacer boards (42) being corrugated parts, the partition boards and the spacer boards being alternately stacked, the total heat exchanger exchanging heat between the outdoor air and the indoor air; and thereby suppresses ice formation. The ventilator (1) includes: an indoor temperature sensor (7); an indoor humidity sensor (8); an outdoor temperature sensor (6); and a control unit (5) to control operation of the air supply fan (2) and the air exhaust fan (3) on a basis of at least one state quantity estimated by substituting the indoor air temperature, the indoor air humidity, and the outdoor air temperature in a total heat exchanger model formula (51a) representing characteristics of the total heat exchanger (4).
