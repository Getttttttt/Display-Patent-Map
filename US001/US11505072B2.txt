abstract
    A regenerative braking system and method include: a regenerative braking determination unit configured to determine whether or not a vehicle satisfies an entry condition for regenerative braking based on information collected by the vehicle; a calculation unit configured to calculate a hydraulic braking torque according to a pressure of a master cylinder and a target amount of a regenerative braking torque varied according to the pressure of the master cylinder, if the vehicle satisfies the entry condition; and a controller configured to perform braking of the vehicle based on the target amount of the regenerative braking torque and the hydraulic braking torque.
