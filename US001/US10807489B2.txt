abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for charging an onboard energy storage device in a hybrid vehicle depending on vehicle operating conditions. In one example, a method includes charging the onboard energy storage device through a dual clutch transmission via an electric machine positioned downstream of the dual clutch transmission, and controlling a driveline disconnect clutch positioned downstream of the electric machine. In this way, charging of the onboard energy storage device may be conducted under conditions where a speed of the vehicle is either above a predetermined threshold speed, or below the predetermined threshold speed.
