abstract
    A bottoming cycle power system includes a turbine generator and an open cycle absorption system. The turbine-generator includes a turbo-expander and turbo-compressor disposed on a turbo-crankshaft. The turbo-expander is operable to rotate the turbo-crankshaft as a flow of exhaust gas from a combustion process passes through the turbo-expander. The turbo-compressor is operable to compress the flow of exhaust gas after the exhaust gas passes through the turbo-expander. The open cycle absorption chiller system includes an absorber section that is operable to receive the flow of exhaust gas from the turbo-expander. The absorber section includes a first refrigerant solution that is operable to absorb water from the exhaust gas as the exhaust gas passes through the first refrigerant solution. The absorber section is also operable to route the flow of exhaust gas to the turbo-compressor after the flow of exhaust gas has passed through the first refrigerant solution.
