abstract
    In certain exemplary embodiments, a system includes a gas turbine system having a turbine, combustor, and a compressor. The system also includes an output flow path from the gas turbine system. The system further includes a blast furnace coupled to the output flow path, wherein output flow path is configured to deliver heated air or exhaust gas from the gas turbine system directly to the blast furnace as a blast heat source.
