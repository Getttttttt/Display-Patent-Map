abstract
    A vehicle brake control apparatus includes a vibration detector configured to detect a predetermined vibration state in a frictional brake device, a power regeneration execution determination unit configured to determine, in a case where the predetermined vibration state is detected by the vibration detector, whether to permit execution of power regeneration by a power generating device or to limit the execution, a pressing force controller configured to change, in a case where the execution of the power regeneration is limited by the power regeneration execution determination unit, a pressing force of a friction material in the frictional brake device, and a driving force cooperative controller configured to adjust a driving force of a vehicle to suppress fluctuation in forward acceleration or backward acceleration of the vehicle associated with a change in the pressing force by the pressing force controller.
