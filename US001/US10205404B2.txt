abstract
    A power converter control system includes a first power converter, at least one additional power converter, a first control module, and an additional control module. The first power converter receives direct current and outputs alternating current as a first power output. The additional power converter receives direct current and outputs alternating current as an additional power output. The first control module controls timing of events of the first power converter. The additional control module is associated with the additional power converter and controls timing of events of the additional power converter. The first control module communicates first information regarding the timing of the first power converter to the additional control module. The additional control module is configured to adjust the timing of the additional power converter to correspond with the timing of the first power converter.
