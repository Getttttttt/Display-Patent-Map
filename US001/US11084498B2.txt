abstract
    An apparatus and a method for controlling a driving mode of a vehicle are provided. The apparatus includes a mode converter that converts the driving mode of the vehicle based on an operation of a mode conversion input. When the driving mode is converted into a custom mode, a mode setting screen for adjusting a setting value of a driving characteristic preset is configured and the configured mode setting screen is displayed on a display of the vehicle. A tuning device then tunes a driving characteristic of the custom mode based on a setting value adjusted on the mode setting screen.
