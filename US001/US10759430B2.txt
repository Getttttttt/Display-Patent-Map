abstract
    A braking system for braking an electric vehicle is provided. The system includes a brake pedal having a regenerative-braking range of pedal displacement from an initial position of the brake pedal to a maximal-recuperation position of the brake pedal, and a mechanical-braking range of pedal displacement starting from the maximal-recuperation position of the brake pedal. A brake controller activates deceleration of the vehicle based on the pedal displacement. The brake controller activates deceleration of the electric vehicle based on regenerative braking within the regenerative-braking range and based on mechanical braking within the mechanical-braking range. The regenerative-braking range is adjusted based on a state of charge of a traction battery of the electric vehicle.
