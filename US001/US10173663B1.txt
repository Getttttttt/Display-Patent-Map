abstract
    An electric vehicle receives propulsion power from two sources of Static, stored, electric power and three sources of Dynamic, generated electric power. The two stored sources are a Battery and a supercapacitor system. The three sources of Dynamic power are: (1) Regenerative power in both the braking, deceleration phase of travel, the downward slope of travel over some extended distance, and part of cruise control; (2) Power from a modified Squirrel Cage Generator; and (3) Power through the solar silicon panels. The Static and Dynamic powers are fed into the current Consolidator, Distributer, and Controller (CDC) systems to provide electric power to the drive motors. The total distance travelled is the sum of the Static, stored power plus the generated power of the Dynamic system.
