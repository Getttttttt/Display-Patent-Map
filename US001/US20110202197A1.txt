abstract
    The power supply system, which may be used with an electric car, extends the life of a high voltage battery while minimizing electric power required for vehicle actions. A temperature sensor measures a temperature of the high voltage battery. A controller preferentially drives first loads given first priority among a plurality of loads driven by the high voltage battery, other than a drive motor, based on an electric power amount that the high voltage battery is able to output and an electric power amount required by the drive motor for driving a vehicle when the temperature of the high voltage battery is not higher than a predetermined temperature. The controller preferentially drives in-vehicle devices of the highest priority among in-vehicle devices based on the electric power amount that the high voltage battery is able to output and the required electric power amount of the drive motor for driving the vehicle.
