abstract
    A fuel cell system to be mounted on a vehicle includes: a fuel cell for generating electric power by using reactant gas; a secondary battery capable of charging and discharging electric power; a converter electrically connected between a drive motor for driving the vehicle and the secondary battery to perform voltage conversion between the drive motor and the secondary battery; and a controller for controlling the fuel cell system. The controller exerts such control that when an accelerator for accepting a speed control instruction for the vehicle has accepted a deceleration instruction under a condition that a charge rate of the secondary battery is equal to or more than a preset value, or when the accelerator has accepted a deceleration instruction under a condition that a chargeable electric power of the secondary battery is equal to or less than a preset value, electric power is discharged from the secondary battery during a period of power-running operation lasting until the drive motor with its torque being decreased shifts to regenerative operation. Thus, increases in frequency at which the auxiliary machine is operated to consume regenerative power can be suppressed.
