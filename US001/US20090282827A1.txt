abstract
    In the present invention disclosed an speed booster gas saving device that recovers exhaust energy of internal combustion engine, wherein the exhaust force and the heat energy of exhaust gases that is wasted is utilized, to superheat a device to transform water instantly into steam energy upon injected inside in addition to the exhaust force to drive a rotor blades connected to the propeller shaft or to the differential gear, to increase the driving torque, power and speed of a moving vehicle in addition to the engine power to reduce fuel burning and emission of exhaust in the environment.
