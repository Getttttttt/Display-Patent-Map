abstract
    The present invention provides a ventilation system for improving air quality of an indoor space. The system includes sensors for measuring PM2.5 particle level P, CO2 level C, and TVOC level T in the indoor space. A control circuit is configured to receive P, C and T values and generate an output signal Vout according to a specific algorithm, which in turn controls speed-variable EC motors that drive ventilating fans. The invention exhibits numerous technical merits such as lower energy consumption, programmable operation, high efficiency, and lower noise, among others.
