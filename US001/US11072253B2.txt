abstract
    The disclosure relates to a power circuit for power supply in an electrically driven vehicle. The power circuit includes a direct voltage connection, an electrical traction drive, and a DC/AC converter. The converter includes an alternating voltage side connected to the traction drive. A DC/DC converter of the power circuit includes two converter sides. The first converter side is connected to a direct voltage side of the DC/AC converter via a coupling point. The direct voltage connection is likewise connected to the coupling point. The disclosure further relates to a stationary energy supply system designed to be complementary and to connect to the power circuit.
