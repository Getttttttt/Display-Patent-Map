abstract
    A water feeding system provided with: a first feed water line through which first feed water flows; a second feed water line through which second feed water having a lower pressure than the first feed water flows; a first heater that heats the first feed water; a first feed water introducing line that guides first heated feed water, which is the first feed water that has been heated by the first heater, to the second feed water line; a medium heat exchanger that causes the first heated feed water to exchange heat with a medium, thereby cooling the first heated feed water and heating the medium; and a cooling water injecting line that injects cooling water having a lower temperature than the first heated feed water into the first feed water introducing line, at a position located further to the second feed water line side than the medium heat exchanger.
