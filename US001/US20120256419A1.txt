abstract
    The invention is directed to a combination heater and electrical generator designed to allow continual use of the heating system in the absence of an external source of electricity. The system shares fuel and electrical inputs and also shares exhaust outputs so to facilitate ease of use installation as well as affording a small installation footprint.
