abstract
    A house/building fresh air to air cross flow heat exchanger includes an inner elongate conduit disposed longitudinally within an outer elongate housing thereby defining a first air passageway through the inner conduit and a second air passageway between the inner conduit and the housing. A portion of the inner conduit is constructed with a sorption paper wall/assembly between the passageways. The sorption paper assembly is cylindrical shaped and includes a plurality of longitudinally extending folded pleats thereby increasing the surface area between the exhaust and incoming fresh air passageways. A cylindrical air permeable screen extends longitudinally through and radially supports the sorption paper wall/assembly. The passageways can be connected to a furnace duct using air scoops to thereby forcibly direct air through the passageways. Alternatively, a fan assembly is aligned with the passageways for forcibly directing air therethrough.
