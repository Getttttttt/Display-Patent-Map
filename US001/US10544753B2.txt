abstract
    Embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure provide systems and methods for a waste heat recovery and conversion. The waste heat recovery and conversion system includes a housing non-invasively mountable onto an engine. The waste heat recovery and conversion system also includes a power conversion unit (PCU) entirely within the housing. The PCU includes heat exchangers, an expander, an electrical power generator, and a fluid pump. The heat exchangers, the expander, the fluid pump, and the fluid reservoir form a thermodynamic loop that drives the electrical power generator using thermal energy from waste heat. Under various configurations the waste heat recovery and conversion system offer pollutant reduction features all together with fuel savings.
