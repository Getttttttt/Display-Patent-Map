abstract
    A control apparatus of an electric vehicle including a motor capable of outputting a vehicle driving force that is a driving force acting on the electric vehicle, and a brake device configured to generate a vehicle braking force that is a braking force acting on the electric vehicle in accordance with a brake operation performed by a driver, includes: a controller. The controller is configured to start a first hill-hold control for maintaining the electric vehicle in a stopped state by using the vehicle driving force generated by the motor as a stopping force for stopping the electric vehicle when the brake operation is interrupted.
