abstract
    A pumping apparatus for a heat engine, includes an extraction line arranged to extract a fraction of liquid working fluid from a working circuit of a heat engine; an extraction line pump for pumping the extracted working fluid; an extraction line heat exchanger for vaporising the extracted working fluid; and a pressure-operated pump for pumping the working fluid around the working circuit, wherein the extraction line pump and the extraction line heat exchanger are arranged in series to convert the liquid working fluid to a pressurised motive gas; and wherein the pump is driven by the pressurized motive gas.
