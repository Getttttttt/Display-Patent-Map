abstract
    A bicycle motor control system, configured to control a drive motor that is provided on a bicycle, comprises a controller configured to control a drive motor that is configured to selectively output driving force in accordance with a manual drive force, and cause the drive motor to stop when a detected manual drive force, sensed by a manual drive force sensor, falls below a predetermined force threshold value, which is set in accordance with a crank angle of a crankshaft.
