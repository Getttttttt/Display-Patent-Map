abstract
    A sectional boiler is described as being made of cast iron or aluminum, in particular a condensing boiler, having essentially annular sections, a front section, a cover-shaped rear section and at least one center section being provided, which form a combustion chamber having an essentially surrounding heat exchanger made of a sectional block, whose annular water chambers are connected to one another via at least one hub and which has gap-like heating gas flues, having a return port and a feed port in the upper area and at least two armature rods for holding the sectional block together. The present system is based on the objective of optimizing a sectional boiler made of cast iron or aluminum particularly with respect to compactness and robustness. In the present system, as heating gas flues the heat exchanger respectively has annular gaps between two adjacent sections having a mutually adapted geometry, which respectively run from the combustion chamber approximately radially outward and open into an exhaust gas collection chamber on the outside of the sections, and the individual sections are respectively divided on the heating water side into at least two flow channels.
