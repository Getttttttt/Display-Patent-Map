abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for an in-cylinder thermal energy recovery device that utilizes the Rankine Cycle to recover energy from exhaust gasses that may be used to produce additional work in the vehicle. In one example, a method may include outfitting the head area of each cylinder of an engine with a tube array comprising one or more tubes passing through the combustion chamber of the corresponding cylinder. Each tube array may receive an injection of working fluid that is based, in part, on the temperature of the tube array's corresponding cylinder, which may then be utilized to recover heat energy.
