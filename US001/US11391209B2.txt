abstract
    A combined cycle heat engine (10). The engine (10) comprises a first gas turbine engine (11) comprising a first air compressor (14), a first combustion system (16, 20) and a first turbine system (18, 22), and a second gas turbine engine (32) comprising a second air compressor (36) and a second turbine system (40). The engine further comprises a heat exchanger (38) configured to transfer heat from an exhaust of the first turbine system (18, 22) to compressed air from the second air compressor (36). The first combustion system comprises a first combustor (16) provided downstream of the first air compressor (14) and upstream of the first turbine system (18, 22), and a second combustor (20) downstream of a first turbine section (18) of the first turbine system and upstream of a second turbine section (22) of the first turbine system.
