abstract
    A method for controlling a state of charge (SOC) of a battery for a cruise travel of a hybrid vehicle includes predicting, by a controller, the SOC of the battery including a change slope of the SOC of the battery for the cruise travel based on a measured value of the SOC. The method includes determining, by the controller, whether the predicted SOC of the battery is equal to or greater than a maximum value of a normal range of the battery when the change slope of the SOC is greater than zero. The method includes driving, by the controller, only a driving motor of the hybrid vehicle whereby the driving motor uses electric power of the battery when the predicted SOC of the battery reaches the maximum value of the normal range of the battery. The normal range of the battery is a region required for the cruise travel of the hybrid vehicle.
