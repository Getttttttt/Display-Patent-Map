abstract
    Disclosed are a multi-wheel aeroplane braking system based on a self-energy-regenerative braking device and a controlling method therefor. The multi-wheel aeroplane braking system based on a self-energy-regenerative braking device can comprise a controller, a self-energy-regenerative braking device assembly, hydraulic pumps, and sets of braking actuators. The controller is connected to the self-energy-regenerative braking device assembly for sending a braking instruction thereto. The hydraulic pumps are respectively connected to the self-energy-regenerative braking device assembly for feeding a high pressure oil thereto under the driving motion of the aeroplane wheels. The self-energy-regenerative braking device assembly is configured to receive at least part of the high-pressure oil fed by the hydraulic pumps and the braking instruction sent by the controller and feeding the high pressure oil to each of the braking actuators according to the braking instruction. The barking actuators are respectively connected to the self-energy-regenerative braking device assembly.
