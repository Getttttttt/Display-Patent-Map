abstract
    A battery regenerative breaking control method applied in an electric vehicle is provided. The battery regenerative breaking control method includes: determining whether a battery pack is at a protection status when the electric vehicle is detected to be at a regenerative breaking status; recording a current battery error time point and obtaining a time threshold according to a current speed of the electric vehicle if it is determined that the battery pack is at the protection status; determining whether a current time is smaller than the time threshold; entering a first stage to adjust a pulse width modulation (PWM) duty cycle if the current time is smaller than the time threshold; and entering a second stage to adjust a PWM frequency if the current time is larger than the time threshold.
