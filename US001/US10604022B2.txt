abstract
    A control apparatus for an electric vehicle provided with an electric motor serving as a drive power source, and a step-variable transmission disposed in a power transmitting path between the electric motor and drive wheels, the control apparatus having a first control mode in which acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle are controlled on the basis of operations by an operator of the vehicle to accelerate and decelerate the vehicle, and a second control mode in which the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle are automatically adjusted according to a target running state of the vehicle, irrespective of the operations of the operator, the control apparatus including a shift-down action initiating condition setting portion configured to set a shift-down action initiating condition for initiating a shift-down action of the step-variable transmission during a regenerative decelerating run of the vehicle, according to a torque-related value related to a regenerative torque generated by the electric motor, and a running speed of the vehicle. The shift-down action initiating condition setting portion sets the shift-down action initiating condition such that the shift-down action is initiated at a higher value of the running speed of the vehicle during the regenerative decelerating run in the second control mode, than in the first control mode.
