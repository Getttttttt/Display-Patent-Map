abstract
    A vehicle has at least one electric machine that can be operated as a generator, an electrical energy accumulator and a control unit for controlling the at least one electric machine and the electrical energy accumulator. The control unit operates so that in a recovery phase the vehicle can be decelerated by the generator load of the electric machine operated as a generator (2 :a) and the resulting electrical energy (1:E) can be stored in the electrical energy accumulator. The control unit is configured so that the at least one electric machine operated as a generator in a recovery phase is operated by said control unit in a chronologically unlimited fashion with a predefinable overload (2 ′:a,  2 ″:a,  2 ′″:a).
