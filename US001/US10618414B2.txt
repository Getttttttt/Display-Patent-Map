abstract
    A hydraulic brake system for a land vehicle includes a brake pedal; a wheel brake; and a master brake cylinder connected to the brake pedal by a brake booster and a pump. The outlet of the pump is connected to the wheel brake by a supply line and the inlet is connected to the wheel brake by a return line. The pump moves hydraulic fluid to the wheel brake. A temporary store is connected to the inlet of the pump and the wheel brake by the return line. A pressure reduction valve, arranged in the return line of the wheel brake, has a throttling effect in the open state. A control unit compensates for the difference between a total braking torque specified by the brake pedal and a generating braking torque provided by an electric machine by setting the hydraulic braking torque during a regenerative braking process of the vehicle.
