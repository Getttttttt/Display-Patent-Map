abstract
    An embodiment of this invention relates to a motor driving control apparatus for a moto-assisted vehicle, which includes a driving unit configured to drive a motor, and a controller configured to determine a regeneration amount based on a first speed of a vehicle that moves by the motor driven by the driving unit, and control the driving unit according to the regeneration amount, wherein the first speed is a speed at a first timing when it is detected that a brake of the vehicle is changed to OFF, or is determined based on temporal change in an acceleration of the vehicle.
