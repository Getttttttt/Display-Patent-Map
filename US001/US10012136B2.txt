abstract
    A system for recovering thermal energy from one or more devices of an engine is provided to increase the overall efficiency of the engine. The system comprises an exhaust turbocharger, which is in fluid communication with the engine and driven by a supply of exhaust gas from the engine. The driven exhaust turbocharger is configured to supply compressed air to the engine. A boiler is provided to transfer heat from the exhaust gas to a heat-transfer fluid to generate a heat-transfer vapor. The vapor operates to drive a vapor turbocharger to supply additional compressed air to the engine. The vapor is further used to absorb heat from a coolant fluid used in an engine cooling system before a vapor compressor compresses the vapor back to a semi-saturated state and returns it to the boiler to complete a vapor cycle. A method for implementing the above-mentioned system is also provided.
