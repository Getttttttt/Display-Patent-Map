abstract
    It is described an integrated process for the production of clinker by dry process, with treatment in continuous of by-pass dusts produced by the kiln, wherein the solid matter to treat consists of bypass dusts of a clinker production process, containing compounds of chloride, sodium, potassium and sulphur, such a process comprising the following steps: a) extraction of the bypass dusts directly from the phase of quench, without intermediate storage, at a temperature comprised between 150 and 200° C., with a moisture content varying from 0.1 to 3% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5% by weight, and with a quantity of calcium carbonate lower than 55% by weight; b) mixing of said dusts coming from step a), within a maximum time comprised between 2 and 10 minutes, preferably lower than about 5 minutes, with water up to a water/dusts ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:1, preferably from 2.5:1 to 3.5:1, in a way to obtain a mixture with a moisture content comprised between 45 and 75% by weight, preferably between 50% and 55% by weight, even more preferably equal to about 50% by weight; c) mechanical stirring of the mixture diluted up to complete dissolution of the soluble salts; d) mechanical separation of the mixture so diluted in a liquid fraction containing water and soluble salts and in a solid fraction in form of cake or crust.
