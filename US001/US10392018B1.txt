abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric machine, a coolant circuit, a refrigerant circuit, and a controller. The electric machine is configured to charge a battery via regenerative braking. The coolant circuit has an electric heater. The refrigerant circuit has an electric compressor. The controller is programmed to, responsive to a capacity of the battery to receive power being less available regenerative braking power and ambient air temperature being less than a first threshold, direct regenerative braking power to the heater but not the compressor. The controller is further programmed to, responsive to the capacity of the battery to receive power being less available regenerative braking power and ambient air temperature exceeding a second threshold that is greater than the first threshold, direct regenerative braking power to the compressor but not the heater.
