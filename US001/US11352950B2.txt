abstract
    An energy storage-combined cooling, heating and power (S-CCHP) system for a building receives energy from a source, for example an intermittent source, and stores the energy in first and second high temperature energy storage (HTES) units. A Brayton cycle using the first HTES unit produces hot and pressurized air that is further heated in the second HTES unit. The heated air drives a turbine to generate electricity for the building. A portion of the compressed air from the Brayton cycle is diverted to a hot water heat exchanger, then to another turbine to produce electricity to the building. The hot water heat exchanger heats water for the building and the other turbine exhaust cools water for building cooling. Heat exchangers are strategically placed to optimize the thermal efficiency of the cycle. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid is humidified to improve thermal energy transfer properties.
