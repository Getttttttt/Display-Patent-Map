abstract
    Described herein relates to a system of and method for recovering energy and providing power in a multi-source transmission assembly, in which the transmission assembly includes secondary power sources in combination with a primary power source, where the secondary power sources are in reverse rotation with respect to the primary power source, such that energy is recovered during deceleration or the secondary power sources power the vehicle as needed. During the translation of a vehicle employing the transmission assembly, at least one motor may function, as needed, to propel the vehicle forward. During times in which the vehicle may not positively accelerating, at least one of the motors may switch to a generator mode to generate energy to be stored in a vehicle battery. As such, at least one of the motor power sources may recover an amount of energy expended by the vehicle during acceleration.
