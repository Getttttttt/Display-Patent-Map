abstract
    A method is provided for controlling a drive unit of a motor vehicle with an automatic or automated transmission. The drive unit includes at least one drive motor, which generates a drive torque in an overrun mode. The drive torque acts as a drag torque or as a creep torque on the drive wheels as a function of the current speed. The level of the drive torque in the overrun mode can be at least partially controlled by actuating a brake pedal. The drag torque applied to the drive wheels in the overrun mode can be controlled by actuating the brake pedal in such a way that a reduced drag torque dependent on the actuation of the brake pedal is applied to the drive wheels.
