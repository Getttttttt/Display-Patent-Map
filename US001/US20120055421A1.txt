abstract
    A sectional boiler is described as made of cast iron or aluminum, in particular a condensing boiler, having essential annular sections, a front section, at least one rear section and at least one center section being provided, which form a combustion chamber having an essentially surrounding heat exchanger made of a sectional block, whose annular water chambers are connected to one another and which has gap-like heating gas flues, which extend between two adjacent sections with a mutually adapted geometry approximately radially and empty into an exhaust gas collection chamber, and having a return port and a feed port. The present system is based on the objective of optimizing a sectional boiler made of cast iron or aluminum as a condensing boiler particularly with respect to compactness and robustness. The present system provides that the return port and the feed port are located on opposite sides of the sectional block, the flow passes through the water chambers of the sections in series starting from the return port, and the individual sections are respectively provided hydraulically with overflow openings in only one place on the periphery and are connected by these on at least one side with an adjacent section.
