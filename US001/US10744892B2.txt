abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for expediting charging of a battery before entry into a zero emissions zone. In one example, the battery is charged with a ratio of motor torque drawn from a first electric motor of an electric turbocharger and a second electric motor of an HEV driveline. The ratio is coordinated with adjustments to an exhaust waste-gate and an intake throttle so as to maintain operator torque demand and propel the vehicle while charging the battery.
