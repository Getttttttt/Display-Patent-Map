abstract
    According to one embodiment, a secondary battery is provided. The separator includes a porous self-supporting film, a solid electrolyte layer, and a first binder. The solid electrolyte layer is provided on one main surface of the porous self-supporting film. The porous self-supported film and the solid electrolyte layer are adhered with the first binder. The first binder exists on both of the one main surface and another main surface of the porous self-supporting film. The solid electrolyte layer includes solid electrolyte particles and a second binder. The solid electrolyte particles have alkali metal ions conductivity. The polymeric material of the second bonder is a same as the polymeric material of the first material.
