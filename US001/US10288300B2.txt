abstract
    In one example embodiment of a hydronic heating system, the system includes at least one condensing boiler and at least one non-condensing boiler, and at least one controller configured for utilizing at least one PID control program to generate at least one signal for controlling firing rates of one or more of the boilers based upon sensed water temperature and temperature setpoint inputs. Depending upon the mode of operation, the at least one PID control program is a first PID control program dedicated to controlling only the at least one condensing boiler, or is a second PID control program dedicated to controlling only the at least one non-condensing boiler, or includes both the first and second PID control programs. Also, outside air temperature serves as a basis for generating the temperature setpoint inputs.
