abstract
    An energy recovery ventilator system includes a belt partially located in each of a first chamber and a second chamber. First and second desiccant units are positioned on the belt. At least some of the first desiccant units are in the first chamber at a first relative humidity, causing air received in the first chamber to achieve a first air humidity. At least some of the second desiccant units are in the second chamber at a second relative humidity, the second relative humidity being caused by the air received in the first chamber. The second relative humidity is modified to the first relative humidity by air passing through the second chamber, the air achieving a second air humidity. A controller causes the belt to move second desiccant units from the second chamber to the first chamber when the first air humidity fails to comply with a specific air humidity.
