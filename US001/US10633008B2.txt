abstract
    A DC-feeding-voltage calculating apparatus includes storage that stores train model information including information for controlling a regenerative power reducing amount in a train in an electrified section; feeding network model information including position information on a substation; and substation model information including control information on a substation voltage. On the basis of: the stored information; a voltage value, current values of feeders by train direction, the voltage and current values being measured in the substation; and first train information on a train including a wireless communication apparatus, an estimator estimates second train information on a train not including a wireless communication apparatus and outputs train operation information. A calculator, on the basis of the stored information and the train operation information, calculates a substation voltage setting value for controlling the substation voltage such that regenerative power is increased in a regenerative car in the electrified section.
