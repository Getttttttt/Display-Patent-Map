abstract
    The present invention relates to a power management system of a pure electric vehicle powered exclusively by batteries which allows the vehicle to carry a load of up to 13 tons, where the system of the present invention is provided with five blocks: a battery system (SBAT) (3), a control and power logic unit (ULCP) (4), a traction system (STR) (5), an auxiliary system (SAX) (36), and a driver's control panel (PCM) 81, where such blocks are interconnected by two buses, CAN bus (128) and Digital/Analogical BDA (129). The battery system has two battery banks (1) and (2) in parallel which are monitored by the BMS (76). The BMS (76) checks whether the voltages at the output of the batteries are the same as the input of the inverter (8) and manages the use of the battery banks in conjunction with the eVSI (73) by operating the battery bank (1) or the battery bank (2) or both depending on the load conditions of each bank. The eVSI (73) coordinates the control and power logic unit (ULCP) (4) which, through its components, controls the flow of energy between the battery banks, the traction system (STR) (5) and the auxiliary system (SAX) (36).
