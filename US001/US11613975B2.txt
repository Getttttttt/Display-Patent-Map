abstract
    A system for improving a steam oil ratio (SOR) includes a direct steam generator (DSG) boiler fluidly coupled with a downhole portion of a steam system via at least a DSG outlet, wherein the DSG boiler is configured to schedule super-heat delivered to the downhole portion to optimize the SOR associated with the system.
