abstract
    Embodiments describe a battery system that includes a first battery module coupled to a regenerative braking system and a control module that controls operation of the battery system by: determining a predicted driving pattern over a prediction horizon using a driving pattern recognition model based in part on a battery current and a previous driving pattern; determining a predicted battery resistance of the first battery module over the prediction horizon using a recursive battery model based in part on the predicted driving pattern, the battery current, a present bus voltage, and a previous bus voltage; determining a target trajectory of a battery temperature of the first battery module over a control horizon using an objective function; and controlling magnitude and duration of electrical power supplied from the regenerative such that a predicted trajectory of the battery temperature is guided toward the target trajectory of the battery temperature during the control horizon.
