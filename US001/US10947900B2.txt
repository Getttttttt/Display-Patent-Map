abstract
    Inlet air heating systems for combined cycle power plants and combined cycle power plants including inlet air heating systems are disclosed. The inlet air heating systems may include a plurality of heating coil assemblies partially positioned within an inlet housing of a gas turbine system, and a vent valve in fluid communication with each of the heating coils. The inlet air heating system may also include a supply line in fluid communication with the heating coils to provide water to the heating coils, and a hot water line in fluid communication with the supply line and a component positioned downstream of a condenser of the combined cycle power plant. The hot water line may provide hot water from the combined cycle power plant to the supply line. Additionally, the inlet air heating system may include a drain line in fluid communication with the heating coils and the condenser.
