abstract
    A modular electric wheel assembly includes integral/in-built acceleration and braking componentry and/or steering and suspension componentry allowing for the modular application thereof. Each modular wheel assembly may receive drive control data from various sensors (such as accelerator and brake pedal position sensors, steering column rotational offset sensors and the like), vehicle control systems or the like so as to be able to independently drive, brake, steer and/or provide active suspension for the vehicle. The wheel assemblies may communicate with each other across a wheel assembly vehicular network, wherein a master wheel assembly may receive drive control data and control the slave wheel assemblies accordingly. The modular wheel assemblies may further communicate with each other to receive various sensor data, including rotational speed sensor data so as to be able to detect loss of traction events and the like so as to substantially autonomously take remedial traction control action.
