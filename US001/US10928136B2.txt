abstract
    The present invention discloses a scrap steel preheating type electric arc furnace and a method for improving a heating cold region of a side wall charging electric arc furnace. This invention includes an electric arc furnace body and an inclined scrap steel preheating chamber. An included angle between the inclined scrap steel preheating chamber and a horizontal plane is 30° to 65°. Flue gas enters the inclined scrap steel preheating chamber, penetrates through the material blocking tooth rake and the scrap steel and is sucked out. The preheated scrap steel slides to a center of the electric arc furnace body along a slot bottom of the inclined scrap steel preheating chamber. The present invention overcomes a problem of lateral stacking of the side wall charging electric arc furnace, reducing impact force of the scrap steel to the device and greatly enhancing reliability of the device.
