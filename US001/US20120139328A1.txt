abstract
    An automotive vehicle braking system includes a hydraulic brake system in communication with a regenerative brake system. The regenerative brake system has both a fixed system logic portion and a user-adjustable system logic portion. The fixed system logic of the regenerative brake system is driven by a brake member displacement.
