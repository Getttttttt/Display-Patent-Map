abstract
    A kind of horizontal type high-temperature hot-blast stove, it includes a furnace body (6), a ball bed (4), a cold air opening (1) and a hot air opening (9). Combustion chambers (2) are respectively set on the left side and right side in the furnace body (6). And several burner guns (3) are set on the bottom of the furnace body (6) which locates on the lower part of the combustion chambers (2). The cold air opening (1) is set on the left side of the furnace body (6), and the hot air opening (9) is set on the right side of the furnace body (6), and the cold air opening (1) and the hot air opening (9) are respectively communicated with the combustion chambers (2) which are set on the left side and right side in the furnace body (6). The ball bed (4) is set in the middle part of the furnace body (6). The configuration of the two sides of the ball bed (4) is a checker brick configuration, and a manhole (5) is set on the top of the furnace body (6).
