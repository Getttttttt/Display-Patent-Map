abstract
    A solar-powered hybrid vehicle disclosed in the present invention comprises a vehicle body, a vehicle energy configuration system, and a brake energy recovery system. The vehicle body collects solar energy through a collection system of solar energy. The solar energy collected is stored in the vehicle energy configuration system of the vehicle. The brake energy recovery device is connected with a battery through a solar charging circuit. A sensor is provided between the vehicle energy configuration system and the battery. The body energy configure system is connected with an automatic control system, an external charging interface and an electric motor. Through the integration of a number of technical solutions, the present invention reduces energy consumption, improves the level of utilization of solar energy, and is more fashionable and fit for human use.
