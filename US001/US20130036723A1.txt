abstract
    An integrated oxy-combustion power generation process is provided. This process includes providing an air separation unit for producing at least an oxygen-enriched stream, providing a carbon dioxide recycle stream, which is combined with the oxygen-enriched stream thereby producing a synthetic air stream, providing a gas turbine comprising a gas inlet , a combustor, and a gas outlet, wherein the synthetic air stream is introduced into the gas inlet, providing a fuel stream to the combustor, thereby producing a power output, and a hot exhaust gas stream, which exits the gas outlet, introducing the exhaust gas stream, along with a boiler feed water stream, into a heat recovery steam generator, thereby producing a steam stream and a cooled exhaust gas stream, and separating the cooled exhaust gas stream into an enriched carbon dioxide product stream and the carbon dioxide recycle stream.
