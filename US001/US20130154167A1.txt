abstract
    An exhaust gas duct apparatus for use in a rotary-hearth furnace for heating a starting material including a carbonaceous reducing material and an iron-oxide containing material to produce reduced iron or granular metallic iron. In an exhaust gas duct for use in the rotary-hearth furnace, a cooling part for cooling an exhaust gas discharged from the rotary-hearth furnace to solidify a metal salt in the exhaust gas, a collision part for allowing the exhaust gas just after being cooled to collide therewith to drop down the metal salt solidified, and a direction change duct for guiding the exhaust gas after being collided, in a direction other than a direction of dropping the metal salt, are arranged in this order in two stages.
