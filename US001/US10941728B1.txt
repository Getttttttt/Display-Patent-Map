abstract
    A machine, method of making, and method of using, along with necessary intermediates, illustratively, by way of a method, there can be a method of generating electrical power, the method including: inputting air, including adjusting flow rate of the air; inputting fuel, including throttling flow rate of the fuel, wherein: the fuel flow rate and the air flow rate are in stoichiometric proportions for combustion, and the fuel is comprised of at least one hydrocarbon, alcohol, or both; combusting a mixture of the fuel and a portion of the air with the remainder of the air to produce heat, wherein: prior to the combusting: combining the portion of the air with the fuel to produce the mixture that, when heated, stoichiometrically forms syngas; heating the mixture with the heat from the combusting; heating the remainder of the air with the heat from the combusting; and during the combusting, matching the remainder of the air with at least one of flow rate, pressure drop, and flow velocity of the mixture; generating electromagnetic emissions from the heat; harvesting the electromagnetic emissions with photovoltaic elements to produce electrical power; processing exhaust gasses produced during the combusting, wherein heat released from the processing is transferred into the mixture and the remainder of the air before the combusting, and the processing removes one or more pollutants from the exhaust gasses; measuring the oxygen content of the exhaust gasses before the processing in ensuring the stoichiometric proportions.
