abstract
    A method for reducing NOx in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) fossil-fuel fired boiler includes the steps of providing a first set of optical measurement devices adapted to measure NOx and NH3 concentrations contained in an exhaust stream from a fossil-fuel fired boiler, performing measurements of NOx and NH3 at an SCR inlet using the first set of optical measurement devices, and determining an NH3/NOx molar ratio using the measurements taken by the first set of optical measurement devices. The method further includes the steps of using the determined NH3/NOx molar ratio in comparison against a user specified NH3/NOx molar ratio set-point, and controlling an NH3 control valve to match ammonia flow to changes in boiler NOx emissions such that the molar ratio set-point is maintained.
