abstract
    A vehicle includes: a battery; a motor-generator configured to be coupled to a wheel; a power converter configured to convert and supply, to the motor-generator, power of the battery and to convert and feed back, to the battery, power generated in the motor-generator in response to rotation of the wheel; an SOC deriving unit configured to derive a state-of-charge of the battery; a battery temperature sensor configured to detect a temperature of the battery; and a switching controller configured to derive, based on the state-of-charge and the temperature, a number of revolutions for switching at which switching between servo-off control and zero-torque control is performed, and to perform the servo-off control if a number of revolutions of the motor-generator is equal to or lower than the number of revolutions for switching and perform the zero-torque control if the number of revolutions is higher than the number of revolutions for switching.
