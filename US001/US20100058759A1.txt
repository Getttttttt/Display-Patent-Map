abstract
    For operating an internal combustion engine having a throttle situated in an exhaust line or exhaust return line, in which a heat engine is driven by a quantity of heat produced by the internal combustion engine, in a first non-heating operating mode of the internal combustion engine, a first setpoint value is preset, a first operating parameter that characterizes a temperature of the internal combustion engine is detected, a first triggering value is determined for the triggering of the at least one throttle as a function of the first setpoint value and the first operating parameter, the at least one throttle is triggered in accordance with the first triggering value, and the at least one heat engine is driven by the resulting quantity of heat.
