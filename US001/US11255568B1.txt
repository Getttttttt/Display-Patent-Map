abstract
    An energy capture ventilation device is provided. The energy ventilation device includes a housing. The housing is formed by a number of side walls to define an interior volume. A duct is connected to the housing, to interface with a ventilation system. A vent is placed on the housing opposite of the duct. At least one generator is attached to the duct. The generator includes a turbine and is connected to a battery. When the turbine is rotated, power is supplied to the battery.
