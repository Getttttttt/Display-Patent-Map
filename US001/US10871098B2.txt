abstract
    Disclosed are a thermoelectric generation apparatus, a heat generation apparatus for fuel storage tanks, and a waste heat recovery system. The thermoelectric generation apparatus according to an embodiment of this disclosure includes a first piping through which a fluid flows, a second piping through which a cooling medium of a lower temperature than the fluid flows so as to radiate the heat of the fluid, a plurality of first radiating fins having one side in contact with air of a lower temperature than the fluid so as to radiate the heat of the fluid and the other side in contact with the second piping, and a thermoelectric generation module provided between the first piping and the second piping to produce electricity through a temperature difference between the first piping and the second piping.
