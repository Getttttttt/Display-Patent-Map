abstract
    A system for steam production for electric power generation may include an electrode boiler. The electrode boiler is configured to provide overheated steam. A steam turbine is coupled to the electrode boiler and is driven by the overheated steam. An electrical generator is coupled to the steam turbine to convert the kinetic energy of the steam turbine to electrical power.
