abstract
    A rechargeable automobile electric power system and method for modifying a front-wheel drive automobile through installation of the system is disclosed. The system includes basic plug-in rechargeable electric drive power units, one that can run simultaneously with the gas motor to improve gas mileage. The second puts a one or two speed gear box between the electric motor and the wheel. This will allow the vehicle to run on rechargeable electric power in town and on the highway.
