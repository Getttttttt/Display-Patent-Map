abstract
    A combined cycle power plant includes a gas turbine having a first compressor, a second compressor downstream of the first compressor, and a regenerative heat exchanger between the first and second compressors. A steam generator is downstream of the gas turbine and receives exhaust from the gas turbine. A closed loop cooling system through the regenerative heat exchanger and the steam generator transfers heat from the regenerative heat exchanger to the steam generator. A method for operating a combined cycle power plant includes compressing a working fluid in a compressor and cooling the compressed working fluid with a regenerative heat exchanger so as to create a cooled compressed working fluid. The method further includes transferring heat from the regenerative heat exchanger to a steam generator.
