abstract
    Disclosed are an electronic brake system and a control method thereof. The electronic brake system includes a first inner valve for transmitting hydraulic pressure to a first hydraulic circuit; a second inner valve for transmitting hydraulic pressure to a second hydraulic circuit; a first outer valve for discharging hydraulic pressure from the first hydraulic circuit; a second outer valve for discharging hydraulic pressure from the second hydraulic circuit; and an electronic control unit for generating a phase delay control signal for one inner valve when a current control signal is applied to the first inner valve and the second inner valve, and generating a phase delay control signal for one outer valve when a current control signal is applied to the first outer valve and the second outer valve.
