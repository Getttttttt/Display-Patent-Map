abstract
    A method for reducing pollution in exhaust gases and a system for treating exhaust gas are provided. The method includes the step of treating an exhaust gas stream with a treating fluid. In one application, the treating fluid is injected by spraying droplets into the exhaust gas stream. A system for treating exhaust gas includes a reagent, and a nozzle to spray the reagent into the exhaust gas stream.
