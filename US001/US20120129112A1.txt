abstract
    A method of and a system for combusting fuel in an oxyfuel combustion boiler. Fuel is fed to a furnace of the boiler. Oxidant gas that includes a mixture of substantially pure oxygen and recycled flue gas is fed to the furnace, prior to the feeding of the oxidant gas. At least a portion of the oxidant gas is preheated to generate preheated oxidant gas. The fuel is combusted with the oxidant gas in the furnace so as to generate steam and to produce the flue gas, and at least a portion of the steam is superheated to generate superheated steam. The preheating of the at least a portion of the oxidant gas is performed by using a heat exchanger that transfers heat from a portion of the superheated steam to the oxidant gas.
