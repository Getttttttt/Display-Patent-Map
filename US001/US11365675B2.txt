abstract
    In general, techniques of this disclosure are directed to a modular generator set system. A generator set system may comprise a primary module, which may include an engine, a generator coupled to the engine, a primary frame configured to support the engine and the generator, and a first guiding element. The generator set system may also include a secondary module, a secondary frame, and a second guiding element that is reciprocal to the first guiding element such that, during installation of the secondary module, the second guiding element is configured to interface with the first guiding element to align the secondary module for purposes of automatically electrically or fluidically coupling the primary module to the secondary module upon assembling the primary frame and the secondary frame.
