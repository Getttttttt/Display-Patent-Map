abstract
    An automotive braking system includes a windshield wiper system, a traction wheel, and a non-friction brake system configured to apply a braking force to the traction wheel. The system also includes one or more controllers operatively connected with the windshield wiper system, and configured to, in response to a braking request, command the non-friction brake system to apply the braking force to the traction wheel. The braking force has a magnitude that depends on whether the windshield wiper system is active.
