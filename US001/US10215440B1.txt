abstract
    A heat exchanger and method which is able to perform in different seasons. The heat exchanger has an upper header and a lower header. Multiple heat pipes extend between the upper header and the lower header, with each of the multiple heat pipes having an evaporator section at one end and a condenser section at the opposite end. The direction of heat flow through the multiple heat pipes is variable depending on ambient air conditions applied to the heat exchanger. A pump is provided in fluid communication with the upper header and the lower header. The pump operates when the heat exchanger is operating in a second mode in which the evaporator section is located above the condenser section, and the pump is disabled when the heat exchanger is operating in a first mode in which the condenser section is located above the evaporator section.
