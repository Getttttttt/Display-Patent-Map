abstract
    An apparatus includes a control apparatus for an electric vehicle. The control apparatus outputs an instruction to reduce the first regenerative braking force according to the physical amount regarding the stroke of the brake pedal to the electric motor. The control apparatus also outputs an instruction to add a braking force corresponding to a third regenerative braking force, which is a regenerative braking force corresponding to an amount of the reduction in the first regenerative braking force, to the brake actuation braking force when the signal regarding the pressing of the brake pedal is input after the signal regarding the return of the pressed accelerator pedal is input.
