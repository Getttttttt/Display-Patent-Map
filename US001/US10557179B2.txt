abstract
    Provided is a method for manufacturing reduced iron which includes the steps of: i) drying ores in an ore drier; ii) supplying the dried ores to at least one reduction reactor; iii) reducing the ores in the at least one reduction reactor and manufacturing reduced iron; iv) discharging exhaust gas by which the ores are reduced in the reduction reactor; v) branching the exhaust gas and providing the branched exhaust gas as ore feeding gas; and vi) exchanging heat between the exhaust gas and the ore feeding gas and transferring the sensible heat of the exhaust gas to the ore feeding gas. In the supplying the dried ores to the at least one reduction reactor, the dried ores are supplied to the at least one reduction reactor by using the ore feeding gas.
