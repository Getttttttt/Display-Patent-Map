abstract
    A heat energy recovery system recovers heat energy from a fluid having a first temperature flowing through a conduit. The conduit includes a manifold chamber through which the fluid flows. A manifold conduit is located within the manifold chamber and contains a fluid heat storage material at a second temperature lower than the first temperature. A storage assembly has a chamber enclosed therein and fluidly coupled with the manifold conduit for storing the fluid heat storage material. The heat energy can be transferred from the fluid having the first temperature to the fluid heat storage material having the second temperature.
