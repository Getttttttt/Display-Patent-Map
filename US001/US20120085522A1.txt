abstract
    A heat exchanger system and a method of assembly is provided for a gas appliance such as a furnace. The heat exchanger system includes an attachment plate having at least one recess sized to receive an inlet of a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger has a first flange disposed at the inlet that is positioned in the recess. A second flange in the attachment plate recess is crimped onto the inlet flange to couple the heat exchanger to the attachment plate. The attachment plate may also include a pair of slots that extend from the recess that are sized to receive a pair of third flanges on the heat exchanger.
