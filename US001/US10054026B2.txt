abstract
    There is provided an exhaust heat recovery structure that may suppress boiling of coolant in a heat exchanger. The exhaust heat recovery structure includes a first pipe, a second pipe, a valve and a thermostat. Exhaust gas from an engine flows in the first pipe. The second pipe branches from the first pipe and a heat exchanger that exchanges heat between the coolant and exhaust gas is provided at the second pipe. The valve is provided at the first pipe or the second pipe. The valve adjusts a flow amount of exhaust gas flowing into the second pipe by opening and closing. The thermostat is equipped with a heat-sensing portion that is disposed inside the heat exchanger. When the temperature of the heat-sensing portion is high, the thermostat opens or closes the valve to reduce the flow amount of exhaust gas flowing into the second pipe.
