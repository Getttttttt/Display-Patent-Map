abstract
    Example apparatus and methods providing for the improved chemical conversion of the combustible components of a gaseous medium are disclosed. In some examples, the apparatus includes a guiding body that guides the flow of the gaseous medium within a reaction chamber of the apparatus. In some examples, the guiding body of the disclosed apparatus is configured to stabilize a residence period of the gaseous medium in the reaction chamber. In some examples, the guiding body results in a flow path of the gaseous medium within the reaction chamber being optimized and/or maximized, and/or results in a short circuit flow of the gaseous medium in the reaction chamber being suppressed. In some disclosed examples, the guiding body causes at least a portion of the flow path of the gaseous medium within the reaction chamber to take the form of a cyclone flow.
