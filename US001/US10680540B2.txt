abstract
    In an apparatus for controlling a motorized vehicle, a rotary electric machine controller is configured to perform intermittent operation by periodically alternating between a driving period and a coasting period. A torque determiner is configured to determine a first torque during the driving period and a second torque during the coasting period. A transition period determiner is configured to determine whether to set a transition period between the driving period and the coasting period. If the transition period is determined to be set, the torque determiner determines a third torque between the first torque and the second torque and within a predetermined rang. The rotary electric machine controller sets the transition period between the driving period and the coasting period and drive the rotary electric machine with the third torque during the transition period.
