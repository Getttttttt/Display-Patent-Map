abstract
    A method is provided for controlling charging of an electric energy storage system in a vehicle including an electric machine which is arranged for propulsion of the vehicle. The method includes initiating the charging upon connection of the energy storage system to an external power supply via a first connector element associated with the vehicle and a second connector element associated with the external power supply, and monitoring a contact resistance defined by the connection of the connector elements. Furthermore, the method includes measuring and calculating the power loss over the connector elements during the charging, and generating an error signal if the power loss is higher than a predetermined threshold value, the error signal being dependent on the magnitude of the power loss. An arrangement for controlling charging of an electric energy storage system in a vehicle is also provided.
