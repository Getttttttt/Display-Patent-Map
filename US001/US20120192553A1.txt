abstract
    Hydraulically driven arrangement for the linear movement of a mass body consisting of two double acting cylinders coupled in parallel, whereby one operating cylinder is a control cylinder for controlling the movement of the mass body, which is split into an acceleration phase, a movement phase and a brake phase. The other operating cylinder is connected as a drive cylinder to the hydraulic power pack as an energy storage, in a manner that the power pack during the acceleration phase of the mass body generates the drive energy for the drive cylinder, and the drive cylinder in the brake phase of the mass body, which serves as a pump for charging the hydraulic power pack. The control cylinder and drive cylinder each have a piston with a one-sided piston rod coupled to the mass body. The control cylinder and the drive cylinder are controlled by hydraulically separated, independent control circuits.
