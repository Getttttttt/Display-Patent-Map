abstract
    Provided is a drive control device for a vehicle with independently driven wheels, the control device enabling the vehicle to avoid unstable behavior caused by an overrevolution of one of the drive wheels. The vehicle includes left and right motors (6, 6) that independently drive left and right drive wheels (2, 2), respectively. The control device includes: an ECU (21) to generate and output a command torque; an inverter device (22); rotation speed detection modules (34, 34) to detect the rotation speeds of the respective left and right motors (6, 6); and a control module (35) to change the command torques for the respective left and right motors (6, 6) so as to reduce the rotation speeds of the left and right motors (6, 6) when at least one rotation speed between the detected rotation speeds of the left and right motors (6, 6) exceeds a predetermined rotation speed.
