abstract
    A control method for optimizing a solar-to-power efficiency of a solar-aided coal-fired power system under off-design working conditions is provided. Through reading the relevant information of the solar collecting system, the coal-fired power generation system, the environmental conditions, and the working conditions of the solar-aided coal-fired power system, the water flow rate range able to be heated by the solar collecting unit and the solar-coal feedwater flow distribution ratio range are determined; through establishing the relationship between the solar-to-power efficiency and the solar-coal feedwater flow distribution ratio, the solar-coal feedwater flow distribution ratio is regulated, so that a flow rate of water entering the solar collecting system to be heated is controlled, thereby maximizing the solar-to-power efficiency and improving the economy of the solar-aided coal-fired power system. The present invention provides clear guidance to improve the utilization rate of solar energy and facilitate the consumption of the renewable energy.
