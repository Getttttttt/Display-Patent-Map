abstract
    A small scale integrated waste processing system for the thermal destructions of waste. The system comprises a compactor (12) for densifying waste and expressing air, a pyrolyzer (13) to receive waste delivered from the compactor, a gasifier (14) with an ash vessel (23) that receives dried waste, and an oxidizer (15) receiving gas from the gasifier to be combusted. Heat energy from the oxidizer can be routed back to the pyrolyzer.
