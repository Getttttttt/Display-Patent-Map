abstract
    A control apparatus that is applied to a vehicle includes a control unit. The control unit is configured to, when the vehicle is traveling on a specific traffic congestion section at a time when the vehicle has reached a downhill control start point or a traffic congestion control start point, not start any of a downhill control and a traffic congestion control. After the vehicle travels on the specific traffic congestion section, the downhill control or the traffic congestion control is started only when an effect of improvement in fuel consumption resulting from the downhill control or the traffic congestion control is expected.
