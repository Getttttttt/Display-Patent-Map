abstract
    An air handling system includes an indirect heat exchange apparatus performing heat exchange between external and internal air heat exchange passages; an external air circulation facility connected to the external air heat exchange passage and circulating an external air in an external space other than a target space through the external air heat exchange passage; an internal air circulation facility connected between the target space and the internal air heat exchange passage; the internal air circulation facility circulating an internal air in the target space through the internal air heat exchange passage; external and internal air temperature sensors disposed in the external and internal air circulation facilities to measure temperatures of the external and internal air; and a control apparatus controlling circulation of the external air within the external air circulation facility based on the temperatures of the external and internal air.
