abstract
    A method and apparatus for sequestering carbon dioxide from a waste gas and reusing it as a recycled gas without emissions concerns, including: given a gas source divided into a process gas and a waste gas: mixing the process gas with a hydrocarbon and feeding a resulting feed gas into a reformer for reforming the feed gas and forming a reducing gas; and feeding at least a portion of the waste gas into a carbon dioxide scrubber for removing at least some carbon dioxide from the waste gas and forming a carbon dioxide lean gas that is mixed with the reducing gas. Optionally, the method also includes feeding at least a portion of the waste gas into the carbon dioxide scrubber for removing at least some carbon dioxide from the waste gas and forming a fuel gas after the addition of a hydrocarbon that is fed into the reformer. Optionally, the gas source and the reducing gas are associated with a direct reduction process for converting iron oxide to metallic iron in a reduction furnace that utilizes the reducing gas, optionally after some modification, and produces the gas source.
