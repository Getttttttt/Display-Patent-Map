abstract
    An axle drive unit may be employed by an electrically-driven motor vehicle having at least one drive axle. The axle drive unit may include at least one electric motor for generating a drive torque and at least one gearing (or transmission) for transmitting the drive torque to the drive axle. The electric motor and the gearing may form a structural unit. The axle drive unit allows a drive train of a motor vehicle to have the simplest, weight-saving construction possible. To achieve this, power electronics and an electromechanical service brake system may be integrated into the structural unit. The electromechanical service brake system may be configured as an inboard service brake system for transmitting braking power to the drive axle.
