abstract
    A power supply system includes first and second energy storages, a power transmission circuit, and circuitry. The circuitry configured to control the power transmission circuit to supply power from at least one of the first energy storage and the second energy storage to an electric load when a first remaining capacity value is larger than a first threshold value. The circuitry configured to control the power transmission circuit to supply power from the first energy storage or both of the first energy storage and the second energy storage to the electric load when the first remaining capacity value is smaller than the first threshold value. The circuitry configured to control the power transmission circuit to stop supplying power from the first energy storage to the electric load when the first remaining capacity value is smaller than a second threshold value which is smaller than the first threshold value.
