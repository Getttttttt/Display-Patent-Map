abstract
    A system and method of controlling regenerative braking of an eco-friendly vehicle are provided. The system eliminates a motor over-temperature state during regenerative braking, effectively prevents a chattering phenomenon in which regenerative braking torque is repeatedly increased and reduced after the motor over-temperature state, and consequently, improves the braking safety and operability of the vehicle. A torque output rate for motor regenerative braking torque limitation is determined from a current motor load and motor temperature using setting information when a motor over-temperature state is detected. Then, a final regenerative braking torque is determined by multiplying a motor regenerative braking torque, calculated from information including battery chargeable power and a driver braking operation value, by the determined torque output rate. Thereafter, regenerative braking of a motor is adjusted based on the determined final regenerative braking torque.
