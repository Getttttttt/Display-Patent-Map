abstract
    An energy recovery device includes a first fluid path extending between a fresh air inlet and a fresh air outlet, and a second fluid path extending between an exhaust inlet and an exhaust air outlet. The first fluid path and the second fluid path may direct flow in a direction that is substantially parallel to one another through at least part of the energy recovery device. In some cases, a bend may be provided in at least part of the energy recovery device such that the first fluid path directs flow in a direction that is at a first angle relative to fluid flow through the second fluid path for a first portion of the first fluid path, and in a direction that is at a second angle relative to fluid flow through the second fluid path for a second portion of the first fluid path.
