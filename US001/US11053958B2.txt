abstract
    A regeneration valve includes a housing defining a first port, a second port, a third port, and a chamber fluidly communicating with the first, second, and third ports. The chamber has a valve element movable between a first position, in which the second port fluidly communicates with the first port, and a second position, in which the second port fluidly communicates with the third port. A resilient member biases the valve element towards the first position. In operation, a flow restrictor element moves between the first port and the second port for restricting fluid flow from the second port to the first port. At a predetermined flow rate between the second port and the first port, if a supply pressure of fluid at the actuation chamber exceeds the bias of the resilient member, the valve element moves to the second position for fluidly communicating the second and third ports.
