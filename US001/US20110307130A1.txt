abstract
    Electric vehicle driving modes and methods of use thereof are described. A vehicle includes a driving mode selection unit. The driving mode selection unit can be used to select a particular driving mode from amongst a plurality of driving modes. A vehicle may be capable of using more energy in a first driving mode than in a second driving mode. A driving mode may comprise at least three vehicle system operating profiles comprising at least three of motor torque curve profile, regenerative braking level profile, electronic power steering profile, electronic stability control profile, antilock braking system profile, and top speed.
