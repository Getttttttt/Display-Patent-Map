abstract
    This brake control device includes: an operation amount sensor which detects the brake operating member operation amount; front-wheel and rear-wheel actuators which generate braking force in front/rear wheels; front-wheel and rear-wheel sensors which detect the outputs of the front-wheel and rear-wheel actuators; and a controller which controls the front-wheel and rear-wheel actuators based on the operation amount and the outputs of the front and rear wheels. On the basis of the operation amount and/or the output of the rear wheels, the controller determines whether or not a long-term low-load state in which the friction member is continuously pressed against the rotary members of the rear wheels within a predetermined range over a long period of time is established. If so, the distribution ratio of the rear-wheel braking force to the total applied braking force is decreased compared to when a long-term low-load state is not determined to be established.
