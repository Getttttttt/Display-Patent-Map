abstract
    An electrical portal wheel hub system is coupled with a wheel and has an electric motor/generator, such as an axial flux motor configured therein and configured to provide power or torque to drive the wheel. The electric motor may be offset vertically from the rotational axis of the wheel to provide additional ground clearance. The electric motor may drive an input gear that is coupled with an output gear that in turns drives the wheel mount and wheel. The gearing ratio can be selected based on the application. A drive axle may from the vehicle may couple with the electric motor and the electric motor may be used to provide supplemental power to drive the wheels. The hub casing may provide mounts for the upper and lower A-arms as well as for a steering arm. The electric motor may act as a generator to charge a battery.
