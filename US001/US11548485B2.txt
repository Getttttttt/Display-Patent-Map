abstract
    This disclosure relates to an electrified vehicle configured to address an excess braking request, such as a braking request in excess of what can be met by an energy recovery mechanism, by selectively increasing the drag of the electrified vehicle. A corresponding method is also disclosed. An example electrified vehicle includes an energy recovery mechanism, an actuator configured to adjust a position of a moveable component influencing a drag of the electrified vehicle, and a controller. The controller is configured to instruct the energy recovery mechanism to meet a braking request and, when the braking request cannot be met by the energy recovery mechanism, the controller is configured to instruct the actuator to adjust the position of the moveable component to increase the drag of the electrified vehicle.
