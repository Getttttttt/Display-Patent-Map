abstract
    An apparatus for rapidly evaporating liquid includes an exhaust flow channel having opposing openings including an upstream opening and a downstream opening. The channel defines an exhaust path proceeding from the upstream opening through the exhaust flow channel and through the downstream opening. Within the exhaust flow channel, a conduit path includes repeated passes transverse to the exhaust path. Attached to the exhaust flow channel proximate the downstream opening, a spray fixture is coupled to an exit port of the conduit. The spray fixture includes a divider to divide fluid from the exit port into multiple streams and an aimer to direct the multiple streams into the exhaust path.
