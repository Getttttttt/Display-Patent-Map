abstract
    A hydraulic system for a work vehicle that has a frame, a ground-engaging implement that moves the frame over a ground surface, and an attachment connected to the frame for movement with respect to the frame. The hydraulic system includes a pump that pumps hydraulic fluid, a first conduit fluidly connecting the pump and the attachment, a reservoir that contains hydraulic fluid, a second conduit fluidly connecting the pump to the reservoir, a fluid resistor fluidly connected with the second conduit, and a valve. The fluid resistor dissipates power from the work vehicle. The valve actuates between a first state in which the valve fluidly connects the pump to the first conduit such that hydraulic fluid is directed to the attachment, and a second state in which the valve fluidly connects the pump to the second conduit such that fluid is directed through the fluid resistor and into the reservoir.
