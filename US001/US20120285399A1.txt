abstract
    A modified portion of gas hot water heater exhaust vent tubing. Cold water tubing is wound around the outside of a tube of the same interior diameter and vertical orientation as the exhaust vent tube that typical gas hot water heaters are designed to operate with. Said vent tube is insulated, double-walled, or is otherwise of a sufficient thickness and/or appropriate material composition so as to prevent condensation occurring on its interior surfaces, and may contain small vents or perforations that allow hot exhaust gases to communicate with the cold water tubing. An insulating jacket is located proximally to the cold water tubing whereby the insulating jacket, cold water tubing and vent tube portion are enclosed within a housing portion. The present invention is meant to easily replace an existing section of exhaust venting typically used in a consistent vertical orientation with a common gas hot water heater.
