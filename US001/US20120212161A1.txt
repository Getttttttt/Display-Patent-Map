abstract
    An electromechanical device includes a first drive member having a magnetic coil, a second drive member capable of moving relatively to the first drive member, and a control section adapted to drive the magnetic coil and to perform regeneration of energy from the magnetic coil when decelerating the second drive member, and the control section includes a first regeneration mode of setting a first regenerative interval centered on a zero crossing point of an induced voltage caused in the magnetic coil, and performing the regeneration.
