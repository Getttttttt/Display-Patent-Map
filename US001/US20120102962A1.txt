abstract
    A combined cycle power plant includes a gas turbomachine, a steam turbomachine operatively connected to the gas turbomachine, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) operatively connected to the gas turbomachine and the steam turbomachine, and a cooling system fluidly connected to the gas turbomachine. The cooling system is configured and disposed to pass a coolant through the gas turbomachine to absorb heat. A condensate system is fluidly connected to the steam turbine and the HRSG. The condensate system is configured and disposed to deliver a steam condensate from the steam turbine to the HRSG. A heat exchange member is fluidly connected to the cooling system and the condensate system. The heat exchange member is configured and disposed to transfer heat entrained in the coolant to the steam condensate.
