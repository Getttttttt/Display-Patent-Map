abstract
    A monorail vehicle includes two bogie assemblies supporting different ends of a chassis. Each bogie assembly includes guide wheels rotatably connected to a bogie frame, a wheel assembly for rolling along a top of a guide beam, and a drive unit. The drive unit includes an electric motor attached to the bogie frame via a mounting flange that is located within a first lateral half of the body, a brake unit, and a planetary gear assembly coupled to a rotor of the electric motor. The planetary gear assembly is located on a first side of the electric motor and the wheel assembly is mounted to an output of the planetary gear assembly. The drive unit is attached whereupon the wheel assembly may be dismounted from the drive unit in a direction of a second lateral half of the body without dismounting the drive unit from the bogie frame.
