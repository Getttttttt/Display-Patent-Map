abstract
    A vehicle driving system includes: a left wheel driving system having a first motor and a first speed changer; a right wheel driving system having a second motor and a second speed changer; a motor controller which controls the first motor and the second motor, a rotation restricting unit which can be shifted between a released state and an applied state; and a rotation restricting unit controller which controls the rotation restricting unit. When the rotation restricting unit controller shifts the rotation restricting unit from the applied state to the released state, the motor controller controls the first motor and the second motor so that a torque sum of the first motor and the second motor approaches zero while maintaining a torque difference between the first motor and the second motor.
