abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery apparatus includes: a housing having a first exhaust passage and a second exhaust passage, an exhaust inlet fitting, and an exhaust outlet fitting; a heat exchanger disposed in the first exhaust passage; and a switching valve having a slide gate which is movable in a longitudinal direction of the housing so as to allow a flow of exhaust gases to be switched between the first exhaust passage and the second exhaust passage, wherein the first exhaust passage is parallel to the second exhaust passage, and the slide gate is movable between the first exhaust passage and the second exhaust passage.
