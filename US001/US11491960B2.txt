abstract
    A force-feedback brake pedal system for cooperative braking of an electric or hybrid vehicle having jointly a regenerative braking system and a frictional braking system includes a brake pedal which is pivotally mounted around a shaft or a bearing, an electronic circuitry which is in electrical communication with the regenerative braking system and the frictional braking system of the vehicle, an actuator for providing force feedback in accordance with the regenerative breaking and friction breaking of the vehicle, the actuator is in mechanical communication with the brake pedal. The force-feedback brake pedal system further includes a compliant element arranged between the brake pedal and the actuator, and a position sensor which, during operation, measuring the deflections of the compliant element and transmitting data to the electronic circuitry.
