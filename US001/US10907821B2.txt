abstract
    A heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) includes: a plurality of vertically-aligned HRSG tubes; and a plurality of stepped tube restraints coupled to the plurality of vertically aligned HRSG tubes. Each stepped tube restraint includes a plurality of tube restraints. The plurality of tube restraints are arranged in an array such that each successive tube restrain is vertically higher than and axially aft of an adjacent tube restraint.
