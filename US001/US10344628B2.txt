abstract
    A compressed air energy storage power generation device 2 includes a compressor, a pressure accumulator tank, and an expander. The compressor compresses air by being driven with renewable energy. The pressure accumulator tank stores the air compressed by the compressor. The expander is driven by the compressed air. A power generator is mechanically connected to the expander and generates electric power, which is to be supplied to a demander. The compressed air energy storage power generation device includes: first heat exchanges for recovering compression heat; temperature sensors that measure the temperatures of the heat media having the temperature increased by the first heat exchangers; high-temperature heat medium tanks, each of which individually stores the heat medium depending on the temperature thereof; second heat exchangers for heating compressed air; a low-temperature heat medium tank that stores the heat medium having the temperature decreased in the second heat exchanger; and a control unit that switches high-temperature heat storage switching valves to thereby supply the heat medium from the first heat exchangers to either of the high-temperature heat medium tanks.
