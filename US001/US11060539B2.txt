abstract
    A device having a hybrid hydraulic-electric architecture includes a hydraulic pump/motor having first and second ports, and an electric motor. The device is configured to connect to two or more pressure rails, each pressure rail containing hydraulic fluid at a different pressure than the other pressure rails. A flow of hydraulic fluid from one of the pressure rails is driven through the hydraulic pump/motor, and a pressure difference exists between the first and second ports. The electric motor is configured to control a flow rate of the flow of hydraulic fluid and/or the pressure difference.
