abstract
    A gas turbine engine includes a supply air conduit fluidly connected to an inlet of a combustion chamber to convey supply air to the combustion chamber, an exhaust conduit fluidly connected to an exit of the combustion chamber to convey exhaust gases away from the combustion chamber, and a recuperator defining a first flow path and a second flow path therethrough, the second flow path being in heat transfer communication with the first flow path, the first flow path defining part of the supply air conduit, the second flow path defining part of the exhaust conduit. Methods of operating the engine are also provided.
