abstract
    The present invention provides a control apparatus for an electric vehicle which improves safety in an electric vehicle capable of traveling using creep torque. The electric vehicle includes a motor/generator for driving vehicle wheels. In a low vehicle speed region during startup or the like, creep torque is output from the motor/generator even when an accelerator pedal has not been operated, and therefore the electric vehicle can be started gently. The electric vehicle is also provided with a friction brake system for applying vehicle braking through frictional force. When an EV control unit for setting a target creep torque of the motor/generator determines that an abnormality has occurred in the friction brake system (step S20), the target creep torque is set lower than normal (step S30). Therefore, when an abnormality that may cause a reduction in a braking force occurs in the friction brake system, a propulsive force of the electric vehicle can be reduced, and as a result, the safety of the electric vehicle can be improved.
