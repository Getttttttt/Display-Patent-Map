abstract
    The vehicle control apparatus include: an inputter receive a regenerative braking signal and an anti-lock brake system operation signal output, and a driver's current necessary braking pressure value, in a regenerative braking state and in an ABS started state, a determiner determines whether the input driver's current necessary braking pressure value is in a first state in which the driver's current necessary braking pressure value is less than or equal to a set target pressure value, a calculator configured to calculate a current pressure value corresponding to a coast regeneration torque value when the input driver's current necessary braking pressure value is in the first state and a controller to convert the calculated current pressure value into a ratio of the current pressure value to the driver's current necessary braking pressure value to compensate for the target pressure value, and transmit a compensated target pressure value to the braking apparatus.
