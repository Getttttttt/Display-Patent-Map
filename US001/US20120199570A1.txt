abstract
    An apparatus and method for heating a defined space uses an engine to generate the heat required. The heating system includes a tank for heating liquid. A liquid coolant system has conduits which extend between the engine and the tank. A first respective conduit supplies coolant liquid from the tank to the engine and a second respective conduit supplies liquid which has been drawn through the engine and heated to the tank. An exhaust transfer system has an exhaust conduit which extends from the engine to the tank. A heating element is located in the tank to provide a supplemental heat source. Heating conduits extend from the tank to the space to be heated. The liquid coolant system, the exhaust transfer system and the heating element cooperate to heat the liquid in the tank quickly, thereby minimizing run time of the engine and increasing the efficiency of the heating system.
