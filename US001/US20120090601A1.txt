abstract
    A condensate collector system includes a condensate collector box having at least one condensate outlet port, and a condensate trap fluidly connected to the at least one condensate outlet port. The condensate trap is configured and disposed to be selectively positioned in multiple drain orientations relative to the condensate collector box to accommodate multiple installation configurations of the multi-poise gas furnace.
