abstract
    A vehicle comprising a framework in form of beam, wheel, drive and braking system, while the vehicle is partially loaded with the weigh of user and the user stands on roller skates and holds the vehicle on the beam so that the wheel is behind the user and contacts with its tire the road surface; and when the user activates the drive, the wheel starts rotating and, as a result of friction between the wheel's tire and the road surface, there arises a force making the vehicle with user move. Additionally, another technique for operation of the same vehicle is being offered, at which the vehicle on the move is positioned in the front of user.
