abstract
    A heat exchanger arrangement (10), especially for a fuel-operated vehicle heater, includes an outer pot-shaped housing (12) having an outer bottom wall (16) and an outer circumferential wall (18) extending along a longitudinal axis (L). An inner pot shaped housing (14) has an inner bottom wall (20) and an inner circumferential wall (22) extending along the longitudinal axis (L). A flow space (24) for fluid whose temperature is to be regulated is formed between the inner housing (16) and the outer housing (12). At least one liquid uptake volume (46, 48) for taking up liquid condensed in the inner housing (14).
