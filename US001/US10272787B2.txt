abstract
    The invention provides a powertrain for an electric vehicle, and an electric vehicle as such. The powertrain has an electric motor and a drivetrain for transmitting rotary power from the electric motor to at least one of the vehicle wheels. A mechanical rotary transmission is provided in association with a flywheel. The mechanical rotary transmission is controllable to transmit power in a direction from the vehicle wheels to the flywheel and further transmit power in the reverse direction. Power from both the electric motor and the flywheel is concurrently used to accelerate the vehicle. The vehicle kinetic energy is recovered and stored at the flywheel during vehicle deceleration. The motor vehicle has at least one battery unit to supply the electric motor. The battery unit is removable from the vehicle, without tools, and is portable so that it is carried away from the vehicle for charging.
