abstract
    A water heater tank has several components formed of a one-piece seamless construction. The water heater tank includes a cylindrical wall with inner and outer surfaces. A helical condenser channel may be formed in the outer surface of the cylindrical wall. The water heater includes a cold water inlet. A cold water channel may be formed in the inner surface of the cylindrical wall in fluid communication with the cold water inlet and the interior volume of the tank.
