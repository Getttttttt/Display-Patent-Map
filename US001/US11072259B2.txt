abstract
    A method for continuously managing thermal energy in a motor vehicle includes initializing a continuous thermal energy management control loop within a controller disposed in the motor vehicle, calculating a quantity of stored energy in a thermal management system equipped to the motor vehicle, calculating a quantity of thermal energy waste in the thermal management system, determining if thermal energy is needed within a component of the thermal management system, selectively generating thermal energy, selectively transporting thermal energy to the component of the thermal management system, determining a thermal storage capacity of the thermal management system, determining if a thermal energy deficit exists within the thermal management system, and directing a flow of a thermal energy carrying liquid to a thermal energy reservoir.
