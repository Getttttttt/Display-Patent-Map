abstract
    A ventilation system comprising a conveying unit for conveying a supply airstream into an interior space through at least one air outlet channel, and at least one exhaust air opening which may have an adjustable opening width. The at least one air outlet channel arranged at a distance from the at least one exhaust air opening, such that an airstream is established during operation therebetween in the interior space. The ventilation system is paired with a humidifying device to supply humidity into the interior space, said humidifying device comprising a generator for generating an aerosol from a liquid with droplets sized to be carried by the airstream, and at least one aerosol outlet channel arranged in the interior space such that the aerosol is captured by the airstream. A method for conditioning an interior space using at least one or more such ventilation systems is further described.
