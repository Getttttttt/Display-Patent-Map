abstract
    Heat is reclaimed from a high temperature gasifier exhaust gas of between 250Â° C. and 20000C. A first duct receives the exhaust gas, and outputs it at a reduced temperature. A second duct receives a heat transfer fluid and outputs it at an elevated temperature. A heat transfer arrangement conducts heat extracted from the product gas to the heat transfer fluid (steam), thereby elevating the temperature of the heat transfer fluid. A heat pipe formed of sodium, potassium, rubidium, or lithium, has a first end for communicating with the high temperature exhaust gas and a second end for communicating with the heat transfer fluid. The heat pipe has an envelope formed of a selectable combination of stainless steel, Inconel, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, carbon, carbon composite, and Hastelloy X, and a safety valve that ensures safe operation. An adiabatic zone is interposed between the first and second ducts.
