abstract
    Methods for vaporizing hydrocarbon fuel and delivering the hydrocarbon fuel in either a vaporized phase or a supercritical phase to, for example, a combustion chamber are provided herein. A method of vaporizing a hydrocarbon fuel, wherein the hydrocarbon fuel is in a liquid phase at a first temperature and a first pressure, and wherein the first temperature of the liquid phase hydrocarbon fuel is less than its intrinsic oxidation or endothermic reaction temperature, the method may include lowering a pressure of the liquid phase hydrocarbon fuel from the first pressure to a second pressure; and heating the liquid phase hydrocarbon fuel from the first temperature to a second temperature, wherein the hydrocarbon fuel at the second temperature and the second pressure is in a substantially completely vaporized phase substantially without thermally oxidizing the hydrocarbon fuel, and wherein the hydrocarbon fuel in the substantially completely vaporized phase does not form carbonaceous contaminants.
