abstract
    Disclosed is a hybrid power generation facility. The hybrid power generation facility includes a gas turbine including a compressor configured to compress air introduced from an outside, a combustor configured to mix the compressed air with fuel and to combust the air and fuel mixture, and a turbine configured to produce power with first combustion gas discharged from the combustor, a boiler configured to burn a mixture of the first combustion gas and air, a first water heat exchanger configured to pass second combustion gas discharged from the boiler and to heat water through heat exchange between the water and the second combustion gas, a water supply device configured to supply water to the first water heat exchanger, a steam turbine through which steam generated in the boiler passes, and a fuel heat exchanger configured to pass fuel supplied to the combustor and to pass a portion of water that is returned to the water supply device from the first water heat exchanger and has a higher temperature than the water supplied to the first water heat exchanger.
