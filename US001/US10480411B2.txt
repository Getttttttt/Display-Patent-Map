abstract
    A waste heat recovery device includes: a low-boiling-point medium Rankine cycle in which a low-boiling-point medium circulates while the low-boiling-point medium is repeatedly condensed and evaporated; a heated water line that guides liquid water, which is heated here, to the low-boiling-point medium Rankine cycle from a waste heat recovery boiler; and a water recovery line that returns the water, which has passed through the low-boiling-point medium Rankine cycle, to the waste heat recovery boiler. The low-boiling-point medium Rankine cycle includes a heater that heats the low-boiling-point medium by exchanging heat between the low-boiling-point medium, which is a liquid, and liquid water, which has passed through the heated water line.
