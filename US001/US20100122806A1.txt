abstract
    Compact and efficient apparatuses for transferring heat, heat exchangers, and furnaces, as well as HVAC units, HVAC systems, and buildings therewith, plus methods of making such devices. Furnace heat exchangers, for example, have an added stage, added in an unconventional way, that improves efficiency without unduly increasing size, while maintaining required radiuses of bends in tubing. Various embodiments orient bends at particular angles to allow stages to fit together more closely, provide improved structure for connecting stages using two collectors that seal against a common junction plate, provide for indoor air passing through the heat exchanger to pass through different passes of the heat exchanger in an unconventional order in order to provide greater compactness, or a combination thereof, as examples.
