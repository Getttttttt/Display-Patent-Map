abstract
    A reliquefaction system and process for innovative reliquefaction of LNG boil-off gas (BOG), where the reliquefaction is propelled by LNG gas fuel. The reliquefaction system is preferably installed on shipboard including LNG carrier or harbor tug, where the LNG carrier and harbor tug use a gas fuel engine.
