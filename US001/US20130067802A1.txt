abstract
    The invention is a bioenergy and/or waste-to-energy process. The invention is a process using controlled pyrolysis reactions to convert biomass and carbon based waste material into carbon byproducts, biofuels and useable energy in the form of heat and/or electricity. The process includes one or more pyrolysis reaction chambers and a thermal oxidizer. Hot, oxygen-free exhaust gases from the thermal oxidizer are modulated through the pyrolysis reaction chambers to sustain the pyrolysis reaction. The exhaust gases along with the pyrolysis gases are drawn from the pyrolysis reaction chambers and routed to the thermal oxidizer. Combustion air is modulated into the thermal oxidizer through one or more ports to control combustion of the pyrolysis gases. After combustion, exhaust gases are recirculated to the pyrolysis reaction chambers to sustain the cycle.
