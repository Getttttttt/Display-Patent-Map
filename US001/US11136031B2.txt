abstract
    A method for controlling a trailer driven by an electric motor comprises defining a distance between the trailer and a towing vehicle as a neutral position and determining an actual distance between the trailer and the towing vehicle. A deviation between the actual distance and the neutral position is determined and output as a distance value. The braking of the trailer is electrically-actuated when the actual distance is decreased relative to the neutral position by at least a first distance value. The braking of the trailer is mechanically-actuated when the actual distance is decreased relative to the neutral position by at least a second distance value, wherein the second distance value is greater than the first distance value. The trailer is accelerated by the electric motor when the actual distance is increased relative to the neutral position by a third distance value.
