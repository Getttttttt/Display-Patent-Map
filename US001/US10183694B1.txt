abstract
    A vehicle drive and control system includes an input shaft driven by a prime mover and extending into a housing to drive a generator. An electric motor powered by the generator drives an output axle, which may be a single axle extending out one side of the housing, or a through shaft extending through the electric motor and out both sides of the housing. The input shaft may be parallel to the axle. A generator controller is configured to back-drive the generator when certain predetermined conditions are met. A motor controller may control an output of the motor based on input received via an operator control device, and the motor controller is configured to operate the motor as a generator under certain operating conditions. The transaxle includes a common housing in which the power generator, the motor, and controllers for the generator and electric motor are disposed.
