abstract
    A controller is applied to a vehicle including an engine (11) and a motor generator (12 and 13) as power sources of the vehicle and a battery (20) that transfers power with the motor generator. The controller charges the battery with a regeneration power that is a power regenerated by the motor generator when the vehicle is decelerated. The controller includes a SOC prediction unit (39, 50 and 205) to predict a SOC indicating a remaining capacity of the battery in a scheduled travel route of the vehicle, based on a predicted result of a road grade and a vehicle speed in the scheduled travel route, a discharge control unit (39, 52, 206, 208 and 301 to 303) to execute a discharge increasing control to previously increase a discharge quantity of the battery to prevent the battery from becoming in a saturation state based on a predicted SOC that is the SOC predicted by the SOC prediction unit, when the discharge control unit determines that the battery becomes in the saturation state where the battery cannot be charged with the regeneration power based on the predicted SOC, a determination unit (39 and 105 to 109) to determine whether a behavior of the predicted SOC shifts from a behavior of an actual SOC or determine whether a SOC shift factor occurs, after a start of the discharge increasing control, where the SOC shift factor is a vehicle control or an environment change that predicts the behavior of the predicted SOC shifts from the behavior of the actual SOC, and a correction unit (39, 110, 201 to 209 and 301 to 303) to correct the discharge increasing control by executing a prediction of the SOC in the scheduled travel route again, when the determination unit determines that the behavior of the predicted SOC shifts from the behavior of the actual SOC or determines that the SOC shift factor occurs.
