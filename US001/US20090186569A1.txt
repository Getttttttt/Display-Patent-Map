abstract
    An apparatus for manufacturing semiconductor devices includes: a cabinet having an opening section on a front surface thereof; a front door that is provided at the opening section of the cabinet in a manner to be freely opened and closed; a low oxygen gas intake port for introducing nitrogen gas or gas with an oxygen concentration lower than a concentration of oxygen contained in an air atmosphere; a gas exhaust port for exhausting the gas from within the cabinet; a ventilation system that introduces the air atmosphere or oxygen into the cabinet; a lock system that is capable of locking the front door in a closed state; and a detector that detects oxygen concentration within the cabinet, wherein the lock system unlocks the front door when the oxygen concentration detected by the detector becomes a predetermined value or higher.
