abstract
    In a high-efficient clean, high-variable load rate coal-fired power generation system, through the internal thermal source SCR denitration catalytic module coupled with high temperature and low temperature storage tanks, the operating temperature of the internal thermal source SCR denitration catalytic module is controlled in a range of 300° C. to 400° C., ensuring that the SCR catalyst has high activity in full-working conditions. Moreover, the high temperature and low temperature storage tanks are coupled with the high-pressure heater group for steam turbine regenerative system, so that when the coal-fired unit needs to increase load rate, the thermal storage energy is quickly converted into output power. In addition, energy stored in the high temperature and low temperature storage tanks come from both the internal thermal source SCR denitration catalytic module and the thermal storage medium heater within the boiler, the operational flexibility and the boiler efficiency are improved.
