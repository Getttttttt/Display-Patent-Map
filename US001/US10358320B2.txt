abstract
    An elevator brake braking and holding an elevator car in an elevator system includes a first brake lining having a first actuating device and a second brake lining, which brake linings cause braking in interaction with a braking strip or brake disk. A second actuating device is associated with the second brake lining, and the second actuating device moves the second brake lining toward the first brake lining, if necessary, thus clamping and braking the braking strip or the brake disk between the second and first brake linings. The first actuating device moves the first brake lining toward the second brake lining to clamp and brake the braking strip or the brake disk between the first and second brake linings. The first and the second actuating device operate according to different principles of operation.
