abstract
    The electric vehicle control method is a control method that includes the motor that gives braking force or driving force to a vehicle in accordance with an accelerator operation, by which the braking force is controlled when an accelerator operation amount is smaller than a given value and the driving force is controlled when the accelerator operation amount is the given value or larger. The electric vehicle control device estimates disturbance torque that acts on the motor as resistance component relating to a gradient and executes correction by which the braking force or the driving force is increased or decreased so as to cancel the resistance component in accordance with a disturbance torque estimated value Td. Then, on a downhill road at a given gradient or more, a correction amount of the braking force or the driving force is reduced.
