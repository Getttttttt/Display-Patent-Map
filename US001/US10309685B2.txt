abstract
    A combined heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (“HVACR”) system including an HVAC sub-system and a refrigeration sub-system. The HVAC sub-system is in communication with an open space of an indoor environment and includes a first condenser, a first evaporator, and a first compressor at least partially defining a first refrigerant circuit circulating a first refrigerant for selectively conditioning an airflow within the HVAC sub-system that conditions the open space. The refrigeration sub-system is in communication with an enclosed space within the indoor environment and includes a second condenser, a second evaporator, and a second compressor and at least partially defining a second refrigerant circuit circulating a second refrigerant for selectively conditioning the enclosed space. Heat from the second refrigerant is selectively transferred to the airflow within the second condenser to reheat the airflow prior to the airflow being discharged into the open space.
