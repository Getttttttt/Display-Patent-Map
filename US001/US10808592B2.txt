abstract
    A heat exchanger for a vehicle is provided to improve fuel efficiency by implementing an integrated structure of exhaust gas heat recovery function and thermoelectric generation function. The heat exchanger allows exhaust gas that is flowed into the heat exchange generator in the cold start mode of the vehicle to pass through the exhaust gas heat recovery component side and thermoelectric generation component side. Therefore, the temperature of the coolant rapidly increases, thereby reducing the engine warm-up time, and electricity is generated through thermoelectric module, thereby maximizing the fuel efficiency improvement.
