abstract
    The invention relates to a container (200) for a heat storage and restitution system, comprising a vessel in which a gas is circulating in order to be cooled or heated. The vessel is limited by a first jacket formed from concrete (203) surrounded by a thermally insulating layer (206), which is itself surrounded by a steel shell (204). The vessel comprises at least two modules (210), each comprising a double wall formed from concrete and a perforated base (205) limiting at least two volumes (217 and 216) which are each capable of containing a fixed bed of particles of a material for storage and restitution of heat (207). The modules are disposed one above the other in a centered manner such that the double wall formed from concrete forms the first jacket formed from concrete (203) and a second jacket formed from concrete (215).
