abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery system applied to an engine system includes a magnetic valve actuator that uses a resistive force against magnetic forces of magnetic elements to decrease a forward movement speed of a push rod made by a wax expansion force of wax that exchanges heat with a coolant passing through an internal space or to decrease a restoring movement speed of the push rod made by a wax contraction force of the wax, or that uses an additional force of the magnetic forces to increase the forward movement speed of the push rod or the restoring movement speed of the push rod.
