abstract
    An engine cooling system comprises an engine cooling circuit, comprising a first pump structured to circulate engine coolant fluid therethrough. A remote coolant radiator positioned along the engine cooling circuit downstream of the engine and outside of a vehicle cooling package area is structured to transfer heat from the engine coolant fluid to air. A coolant heat exchanger is positioned along the engine cooling circuit in parallel to the remote coolant radiator. A waste heat recovery system comprises a working fluid circuit comprising a second pump. The coolant heat exchanger is positioned along the working fluid circuit and is structured to transfer heat from the engine coolant fluid to the working fluid. An expander is structured to convert energy from the heat transferred to the working fluid from the engine cooling fluid to mechanical energy. A condenser positioned downstream of the expander is structured to cool the working fluid.
