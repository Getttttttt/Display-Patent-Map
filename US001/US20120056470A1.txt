abstract
    The present invention features braking control methods for an electric vehicle. Such methods include identifying a vehicle operational condition occurring during regenerative braking that reduces regenerative braking capacity; linearly reducing the amount of regenerative braking of a motor of the electric vehicle after identifying such a vehicle operational condition; and at the same time, increasing the amount of hydraulic braking of a hydraulic braking system to compensate for the reducing of the amount of regenerative braking. Such operational conditions include when the temperature of a motor or battery is increased above a predetermined level during regenerative braking or when the shift lever is shifted to Neutral (N) position by a driver during regenerative braking.
