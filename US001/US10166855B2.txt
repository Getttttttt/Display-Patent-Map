abstract
    A method of calculating an engine torque request value for a vehicle includes a vehicle controller receiving an regeneration torque request value corresponding to a regeneration torque to be generated by an energy recovery mechanism. The vehicle controller further receives a desired acceleration value, and calculates the engine torque request value based on the regeneration torque request value and the desired acceleration value. The vehicle controller may then operate the engine in accordance with the engine torque request value.
