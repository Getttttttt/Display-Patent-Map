abstract
    A series train of symmetrical dual rod-end double-action hydraulic cylinders with a cross sectional area in a series of powers of 2. The cylinders have corresponding computer controlled valves. The cylinders are switchable into three states. One state of shortcutting 2 fluid ports, another state of driving towards each opposite direction of reciprocation and the third state of idling. In the cylinder train all same polarity ports of the valve assembly are connected by hoses or pipes to align towards the same orientation to enable synchronous reciprocal motion and train power output.
