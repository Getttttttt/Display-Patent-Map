abstract
    In an emergency stop situation, the regenerative braking system is used to assist in rapid deceleration, by combining regenerative braking with conventional friction brakes. Sensors can also be used to trigger the braking systems, even before the driver is able to react. These sensors might include external cameras, ABS activation detection, radar and ultrasound.
