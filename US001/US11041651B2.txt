abstract
    Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to an energy recovery system for a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system. The energy recovery system includes a nozzle having a flow passage with an inlet passage and an outlet passage that is narrowed relative to the inlet passage, in which the nozzle is configured to couple to a condenser and receive an air flow into the flow passage from a condenser fan. The energy recovery system further includes a wind turbine disposed within the outlet passage of the flow passage and having a first axis of rotation, and a generator that is external to the nozzle and that includes a shaft with a second axis of rotation. The generator is coupled to the wind turbine, such that the first axis of rotation is aligned with the second axis of rotation.
