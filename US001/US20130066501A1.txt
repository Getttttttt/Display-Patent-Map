abstract
    It is desirable to enhance efficiency of a power conversion device in both of a case where a motor generator which is an electric rotating machine is operated as a motor and a case where the motor generator is operated as a generator by performing regeneration braking. At the time of performing regeneration braking, strength of regeneration braking can be controlled by making an inverter circuit conductive in response to a predetermined phase of an AC output which the inverter circuit generates and by controlling a conduction width. Due to such a control, the number of times of switching a semiconductor element which constitutes the inverter circuit can be reduced thus suppressing heat generation of the semiconductor element and also the efficiency of the power conversion device can be enhanced. Further, the enhancement of efficiency of the power conversion device can be realized also in a motor operation and hence, it is also possible to enhance efficiency with respect to the traveling of a vehicle.
