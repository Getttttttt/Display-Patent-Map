abstract
    Methods and systems for operating axles of a vehicle are provided. In one example, relationships between accelerator pedal position and driver demand torque may be adjusted as a function of a vehicle's geographical location. Further, a relationship between brake pedal position and requested braking amount may be adjusted as a function of a vehicle's geographical location.
