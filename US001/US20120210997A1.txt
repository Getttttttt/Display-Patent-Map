abstract
    Described is a method and device for generating steam and low oxygen gas. The device includes a burner assembly adapted to generate a hot combustion gas. A combustion chamber is included that has a series of water-filled coils positioned therein. Feedwater that passes through the water-filled coils is turned into steam by heat from the combustion gas. The steam exits the device for transport to a steam system for use therein. A water pool is positioned beneath the combustion chamber to cool combustion gases from the combustion chamber. A cooling water system is included that provides cooling water to the water pool. A demisting filter is positioned above the water pool to remove water droplets from the combustion gas. Finally, an exhaust opening is positioned downstream from the demisting filter to allow the combustion gas to exit the device for use elsewhere.
