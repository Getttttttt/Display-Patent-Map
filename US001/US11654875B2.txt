abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric machine, friction brakes, a drivetrain, and a controller. The electric machine is configured to recharge a battery during regenerative braking. The friction brakes are configured to apply torque to wheels of the vehicle to slow the vehicle. The controller is programmed to, in response to and during an anti-locking braking event, generate a signal indicative of a total torque demand to brake the vehicle based on a difference between a desired wheel slip ratio and an actual wheel slip ratio, adjust a regenerative braking torque based on a product of the signal and a regenerative braking weighting coefficient, adjust a friction braking torque based on a product of the signal and a friction braking weighting coefficient, and further adjust the regenerative braking torque based on a closed-loop control of an estimated regenerative braking torque feedback.
