abstract
    Systems and methods for generating electrical power in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation include one or more heat exchangers incorporated into mobile heat generation units, and which will receive a heated fluid flow from one or more heat sources, and transfer heat therefrom to a working fluid that is circulated through an ORC unit for generation of power. In embodiments, the mobile heat generation units comprise pre-packaged modules with one or more heat exchangers connected to a pump of a recirculation system, including an array of piping, such that each mobile heat generation unit can be transported to the site and installed as a substantially stand-alone module or heat generation assembly.
