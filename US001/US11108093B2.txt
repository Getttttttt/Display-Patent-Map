abstract
    A power-supply control device includes: a distribution adjustment unit adjusting electric energy; and a loss comparison unit comparing losses in power running and regeneration and determining, with respect to power running and regeneration, whether a loss in a current state is smaller. Further, the distribution adjustment unit adjusts the electric energy by performing the distribution in accordance with the remaining capacity ratio in the current state in a case where it is determined that the loss in power running is smaller when the current state is a power running state or in a case where it is determined that the loss in regeneration is smaller when the current state is a regeneration state.
