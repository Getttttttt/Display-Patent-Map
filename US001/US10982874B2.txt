abstract
    An air-conditioning apparatus includes a heat pipe, which performs heat exchange. The air-conditioning apparatus provides supply air in a set state (temperature, humidity) through a change in the flow passage of ventilation air and outside air by the selective opening/shutting of dampers, cooling the outside air by spraying mist, and cooling and humidifying the supply air. The cooling temperature and humidity of the supply air is controlled at a ratio of the ventilation air passing through a cooling coil and the ventilation air passing through a bypass passage. Using a bypass passage, ventilation air can directly move to an air supply block without the intervention of the cooling coil within a heat exchange block through which a ventilation air passes.
