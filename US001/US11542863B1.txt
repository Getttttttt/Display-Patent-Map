abstract
    A power plant is provided including a heat recovery steam generator positioned to receive a flow of an exhaust gas and having a heating surface, an exhaust gas recirculation line branching off at an extraction point within the heat recovery steam generator and opening into the heat recovery steam generator at an injection point upstream of the extraction point within the heat recovery steam generator, a thermal storage system arranged between the extraction point and the injection point in the exhaust gas recirculation line wherein the thermal energy storage system stores thermal energy, and a blower arranged in the exhaust gas recirculation line to push air or exhaust gas through the thermal energy storage system.
