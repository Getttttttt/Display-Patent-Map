abstract
    A heat exchanger includes a lamellar structure of a plurality of parallel heat exchange elements with an intermediate air gap between each pair of adjacent heat exchange elements. Along a longitudinal direction of the lamellar structure the heat exchange elements is interconnected in a top portion of the lamellar structure that forms an inlet channel through the heat exchange elements and in a bottom portion of the lamellar structure that forms an outlet channel through the heat exchange elements.
