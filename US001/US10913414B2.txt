abstract
    Methods are provided for optimizing usage of water harvested or generated on-board a vehicle. An amount of water selected for injection or spraying purposes, as well as an order of water injection responsive to various vehicle operating conditions, is varied based on the amount of water to be delivered, as well as a current water level relative to a predicted future water level. The method allows water usage benefits to be maximized particularly when water availability is limited.
