abstract
    A system and method is provided for converting electrical energy input provided by a renewable prime energy into efficient thermo-dynamic energy for cogeneration purposes, activated by the main infrared radiation means and an energy density increasing means functioning synergistically. A closely approximated ideal blackbody condition therein, is utilized to heat the (TES,) resulting in a highly stable total kinetic energy (TES) mass. Another section provides an energy density increasing means. Steam generates power and then heats residential or commercial buildings. Service hot-water and air conditioning is also provided. The system can be an auxiliary system for other power plants increasing efficiency. In the second embodiment, higher capacity low cost electricity generation enables efficient power cogeneration. A zero emission cogeneration system that includes a fast energy density increasing feature and central heating means, and second embodiment plant with high capacity cogeneration; are presented as what are new in the art.
