abstract
    Systems and methods provide control the amount of battery SOC of a hybrid vehicle prior to reaching a downgrade section of roadway in order to offset the amount of energy that the hybrid vehicle will recuperate when traveling the downgrade. Navigation systems and methods are used to identify upcoming road conditions, such as downgrades. In this way, the battery SOC of the hybrid vehicle can maintain the capacity to allow a motor of the hybrid vehicle to assist in decelerating the hybrid vehicle during the downgrade if need be. Additionally, a situation where the battery is fully charged before reaching the end of the downgrade is avoided, which if not, could result in overcharging the battery, or having to switch to an engine-only mode of travel, where a driver must supplement engine braking with friction braking.
