abstract
    The purpose of the present invention is to provide a condensing boiler employing an eco-friendly evaporation device, in which condensed water generated in a latent heat exchanger is removed by using the evaporation device, so that the condensing boiler can be installed in a site without a processing facility for discharging condensed water and contribute to energy saving. For implementation thereof, the present invention comprises: a blower (110) for supplying a supply-air; a sensible heat exchanger (140) for absorbing combustion sensible heat generated in a combustion chamber (130) by combustion by a burner (120); a latent heat exchanger (150) for absorbing latent heat of steam included in combustion gas which has finished heat exchange in the heat sensible exchanger (140); and an evaporation device (160) which absorbs condensed water generated in the latent heat exchanger (150), and has an evaporation type humidifier (161) for evaporating and removing the absorbed condensed water by using air supplied from the blower (110).
