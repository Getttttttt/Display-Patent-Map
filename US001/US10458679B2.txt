abstract
    A heat exchanger for boilers, in particular for condensing boilers. The heat exchanger having a set of heat exchanging plates inside which the water to be heated flows and outside which the combustion products coming from a burner pass. The heat exchanger has plates coupled to diaphragms for closing openings present on the plates; each plate having at least two levels of respective channels for the water flow to be heated. Hydraulic connections in series between the channels can be provided on the layer closest to a burner.
