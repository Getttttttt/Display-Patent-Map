abstract
    System, methods, and other embodiments described herein relate to adapting a manner of braking according to brake wear of friction brakes of a vehicle. In one embodiment, a method includes identifying whether brake wear of at least one of the friction brakes satisfies a threshold for modifying a deceleration pattern of the vehicle. The deceleration pattern indicates how regenerative brakes and the friction brakes are engaged to decelerate the vehicle individually for each wheel of the vehicle. The method includes adjusting the deceleration pattern according to at least the brake wear of the at least one of the friction brakes to transition braking from the at least one of the friction brakes to the regenerative brakes. The method includes controlling the vehicle to decelerate according to the deceleration pattern upon receiving a control input.
