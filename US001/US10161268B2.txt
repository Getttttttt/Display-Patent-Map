abstract
    A damper assembly for minimizing heat loss through an exhaust stack includes a housing mountable within the stack and an umbrella received within the housing. The umbrella is selectively movable between a first position in which the umbrella is received within the housing, and second position in which the umbrella is extended from the housing such that a peripheral edge of the umbrella is in close association with an interior sidewall of the exhaust stack to minimize a flow of fluid past the umbrella and out of the stack.
