abstract
    The present invention relates to an energy efficient method of combined heat and power/combined-cycle electricity generation method and gasification method utilizing a multi-process method of producing, methane, biodiesel, and ethanol production. The waste heat from the combined heat and power generation/combined-cycle method and gasification method is utilized by these multiple methods in such a manner that the waste heat of each successive method serves directly as the heat reservoir for the succeeding method before it is reclaimed at the back-end of the combined-cycle method.
