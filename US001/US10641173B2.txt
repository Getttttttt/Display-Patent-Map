abstract
    In a gas turbine system including a first gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator and a steam turbine generator heat rejection system, the present invention relates to a method for CO2 capture from flue gas in said system, said method including: (a) diverting an amount of heat recovery steam generator flue gas from the CO2 capture plant; and (b) mixing the diverted heat recovery steam generator flue gas with an air stream, forming a combined gas stream, wherein (1) the combined gas stream is fed to a second gas turbine generator; (2) exhaust gas from the second gas turbine generator is mixed with exhaust gas from the first gas turbine generator, forming a combined exhaust gas stream; and (3) the combined exhaust gas stream enters the heat recovery steam generator, with the CO2 content of the combined exhaust gas stream increased through supplementary firing in the heat recovery steam generator.
