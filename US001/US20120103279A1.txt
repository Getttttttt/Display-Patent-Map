abstract
    A method and apparatus for conveying condensate from an exhaust system of a gas water heater to a drain. The method includes the steps of operating the gas water heater to produce products of combustion, operating a blower to cause the products of combustion to flow through the exhaust system to atmosphere, allowing condensate from the products of combustion to form within the exhaust system, using a drain conduit to connect a relatively high pressure zone of the exhaust system to a relatively low pressure zone of the exhaust system, using a pressure differential between the relatively high pressure zone and the relatively low pressure zone to convey condensate through the drain conduit from the relatively high pressure zone to the relatively low pressure zone, and conveying condensate from the relatively low pressure zone to the drain.
