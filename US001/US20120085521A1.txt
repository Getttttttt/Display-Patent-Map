abstract
    An attachment between a heat exchanger and a cell panel of a furnace includes a cell panel including a plurality of cell panel openings and a heat exchanger having a plurality of cells. Each cell has a cell outlet insertable into a cell panel opening of the plurality of cell panel openings. A compressible gasket is insertable between the cell panel openings and the cell outlets and securable therein when the heat exchanger is secured to the cell panel. A crimping tool for securing a heat exchanger cell outlet to a cell panel of a furnace includes a male portion including a split die having two die halves and a die expander configured to separate the two die halves to engage an inner surface of the cell outlet. A female portion applies a force to the cell outlet to crimp the cell outlet to the cell panel.
