abstract
    A phase-shift-assisted gravity drive system is provided. The phase-shift-assisted gravity drive system has a series of repeating phase-shift chambers separated by inner baffles, wherein the series of repeating steam chambers define a circular loop about a hub. The phase-shift-assisted gravity drive system with the addition of a heat source is adapted to unidirectionally change steam from one phase-shift chamber to spraying condensation flowing into an adjacent phase-shift chamber. Thereby, the phase-shift-assisted gravity drive system generates force through this unidirectional transfer of the fluid throughout the loop of phase-shift chambers so that the loop rotates about its hub under the further influence of gravity, wherein the hub can be attached to a mechanism for applying rotation force thereto.
