abstract
    A closed loop vapor cycle generated by a special device formed by heat transfer and a vapor expander means it is utilized to convert waste heat from conventional power systems into additional thermodynamic work, thereby improving the overall power system efficiency. Superheated vapor (i.e. steam) is instantaneously produced inside special energy transfer means where waste heat is converted into fluid energy with desired thermodynamic properties. The superheated vapor is then converted into mechanical energy through special work-producing units (expanders), thereby returning a significant fraction of the energy contained in the waste heat to the power system.
