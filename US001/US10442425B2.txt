abstract
    A work vehicle includes a propelling device, which consists of a pair of right and left front wheels and a pair of right and left rear wheels, an engine configured to drive one of the pair of front wheels and the pair of rear wheels, an electric motor configured to drive the other of the pair of front wheels and the pair of rear wheels, a battery configured to supply electric power to the electric motor, and a controller configured to control the electric motor. The controller performs regeneration control at constant current value to charge the battery with regenerative power of the electric motor at a constant current value regardless of rotation speed of the electric motor.
