abstract
    A dehumidizer includes an upper air passage, a lower air passage, a rotary heat storage device, an evaporator, a condenser, a motor, and a fan. The upper air passage and the lower air passage are separated by a partition, and the right end of the upper air passage has an air inlet, and the right end of the lower air passage has an air outlet, and the left end of the upper air passage and the left end of the lower air passage are communicated with each other. The upper end of the rotary heat storage device is disposed in the upper air passage, and the lower end of the rotary heat storage device is disposed in the lower air passage, and the motor drives the rotary heat storage device to rotate. The evaporator, condenser and fan are installed sequentially from left to right into the lower air passage.
