abstract
    The waste heat recovery system of an engine includes a Rankine cycle, a first bypass passage, a first valve and a control unit. The Rankine cycle allows a working fluid to circulate therethrough. The Rankine cycle has a first heat exchanger, a second heat exchanger, an expander and a condenser. The first heat exchanger exchange heat between the working fluid and the engine or a first intermediate medium exchanging heat with the engine. The first bypass passage allows the working fluid to pass therethrough. One end of the first bypass passage is located at an upstream side of the condenser and the other end is located at a downstream side of the condenser. The first valve opens and closes the first bypass passage. When temperature of the engine or the first intermediate medium is lower than a first predetermined value, the control unit opens the first valve.
