abstract
    Truly electric cars may make other cars obsolete. Not just gasoline cars, but other electric cars. Unlike gasoline cars, truly electric cars can be divided up into modules. Different fuels—gasoline, electricity from batteries, hydrogen—can be used to power the car by replacing a power unit. Car bodies can be updated to conform to changing fashion. Even while keeping the motors that power the car, still good for a million miles. Functions like four-wheel drive and electronic stability control can be done in software, so they can be fixed and upgraded cheaply. Motor controls can be software-based too, and upgraded over the Internet rather than requiring a mechanic's services. With electric motors in a car's wheels, it can beat any gasoline car, going from 0 to 100 miles per hour in 10 seconds, while getting 100 miles per gallon and going 1,000 miles on a tank of gas.
