abstract
    This disclosure discloses a braking-recovery system and method for a train, and a train. The system includes: a traction network, a train, and an energy storage power station. The energy storage power station is connected to the traction network, the energy storage power station includes a second controller, and the second controller controls the energy storage power station according to the voltage of the traction network to perform charging or discharging. The train includes: an electric brake; a battery; a distributor, connected to the electric brake, where there is a node between the distributor and the electric brake; a bidirectional DC/DC converter, where one end of the bidirectional DC/DC converter is connected to the battery, and another end of the bidirectional DC/DC converter is connected to the node; and a first controller, used to control, when the train is braked, the distributor and the bidirectional DC/DC converter to feed back braking electric energy of the train to the traction network, and control the bidirectional DC/DC converter according to a voltage of the traction network to absorb the braking electric energy of the train by using the battery.
