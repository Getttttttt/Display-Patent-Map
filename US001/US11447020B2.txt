abstract
    A lift device comprises a base, a linear actuator, and a rechargeable battery system. The base has a plurality of wheels. The linear actuator is configured to selectively move a work platform configured to support a load between a raised position and a lowered position. The linear actuator has an electric motor. The rechargeable battery system includes a battery, a heating system, and a battery charger. The battery is configured to power the electric motor of the linear actuator. The heating system is configured to selectively provide heat to the battery. The battery charger is configured to selectively charge the battery and to selectively charge the heating system. The heating system is configured to receive power from the battery through a battery power connection and to receive power from the battery charger through a battery charger power connection.
