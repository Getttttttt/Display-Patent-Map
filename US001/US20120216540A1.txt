abstract
    The invention relates to a method for recovering heat by joining a plurality of heat flows of a fossil-fired, in particular carbon-fired, power plant (1), which downstream of the combustion comprises a CO2 scrubbing station (58) for the flue gas by way of chemical absorption and/or desorption and associated CO2 compression (27), which method aims to enable a CO2 scrubbing station for the flue gas, with associated CO2 compression, to be integrated into the total energy heat flow and/or the total heat energy balance of a fossil-fired, in particular carbon-fired, preferably conventional, power plant in a way that is advantageous in terms of heating technology. This is achieved by decoupling thermal energy from the heat flow of the CO2 scrubbing station (58), with associated CO2 compression, in the form of at least one partial heat flow (Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11) and coupling it back into a heat flow that is coupled, directly or indirectly, to the heat flow of the boiler (2) or steam generator of the power plant (1), and/or by decoupling thermal energy from the flue gas heat flow (Q3) in the form of a partial heat flow (Q12, Q13, Q14) and coupling it back into the heat flow of the CO2 scrubbing station (58) with associated CO2 compression (27).
