abstract
    Hydrocarbon feed to a catalytic reactor can be heat exchanged with flue gas from a catalyst regenerator. This innovation enables recovery of more energy from flue gas thus resulting in a lower flue gas discharge temperature. As a result, other hot hydrocarbon streams conventionally used to preheat hydrocarbon feed can now be used to generate more high pressure steam.
