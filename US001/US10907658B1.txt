abstract
    The disclosed fluidic power transmission apparatus may include a conduit having an internal volume for containing a fluid, a reciprocating input mechanism for alternating at least one of fluid flow or fluid pressure within the conduit, the reciprocating input mechanism being in fluid communication with the internal volume of the conduit, and a slave unit coupled to the conduit such that the slave unit is positioned to be driven by the alternating fluid flow or fluid pressure within the internal volume of the conduit. Various other methods and systems are also disclosed.
