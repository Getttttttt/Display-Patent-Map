abstract
    A control unit of vehicle is provided including a device for controlling regenerative braking of a vehicle. The device is provided with a drive wheel and a drive motor driving the drive wheel may include a vehicle control unit for calculating a regenerative amount and distributing a target braking force corresponding to the calculated regenerative amount; and a control unit controlling a transmission so that torque of the motor is increased in case of decelerating regeneration of the drive motor.
