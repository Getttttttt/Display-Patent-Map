abstract
    A four-wheel drive electric vehicle is provided. The vehicle comprises a chassis and a power system. The power system comprises batteries, an electric motor, a DC-DC converter and an electric motor controller which are electrically connected, and the chassis comprises a frame, a transmission/transfer case, a drive shaft, a front axle assembly as well as a rear axle assembly. The transmission/transfer case, the front axle assembly and the rear axle assembly are mounted on the frame. The transmission/transfer case is connected with the rear axle assembly directly and with the front axle assembly via the drive shaft. Under the control of the electric motor controller, the electric motor is driven to rotate by the batteries, whereby a power is transferred from the motor to the transmission/transfer case, and a part of the power is transferred to the rear axle assembly with the other part transferred to the front axle assembly via the drive shaft.
