abstract
    A system for optimizing a trip for a hybrid vehicle, comprising a computer programmed to determine a route for the hybrid vehicle to travel, obtain altitude and terrain information of the route, and generate a trip plan based on at least the route and altitude to minimize total energy expended along the route by encouraging regenerative braking during portions of the route, regardless of needs to slow the hybrid vehicle.
