abstract
    A vehicle driving control method depending on a baby mode, may include, when the baby mode is activated, receiving information on a state of a vehicle seat, correcting a center state of charge (SOC) value of a battery of the vehicle based on the information on the state of the vehicle seat, determining a state of a transmission of the vehicle, and performing regenerative brake and brake pedal stroke (BPS) scale/filtering correction control or an electric vehicle (EV) mode and accelerator position sensor (APS) scale/filtering correction control based on the state of the transmission of the vehicle and the state of the vehicle seat.
