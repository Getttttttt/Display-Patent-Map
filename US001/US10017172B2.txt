abstract
    Methods, systems, and apparatus for providing coasting guidance for a vehicle and improving visibility of the indicator, on the display, to indicate to the driver to begin coasting. The coasting guidance system includes a display configured to display an indicator to a driver to begin coasting. The coasting guidance system includes an electronic control unit coupled to the display. The electronic control unit is configured to determine a location of a stop event for the vehicle and determine a braking location for the vehicle based on the location of the stop event for the vehicle. The electronic control unit is configured to determine an ideal coasting location for the vehicle based on the braking location for the vehicle and cause an indicator on the display to pulse at or within a threshold distance of the ideal coasting location to indicate to the driver to begin coasting.
