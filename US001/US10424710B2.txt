abstract
    An engine includes a cylinder liner. The cylinder liner includes an interior wall, an exterior wall, and a thermoelectric element disposed therebetween. The interior wall forms a cylinder bore forming part of a combustion chamber. The exterior wall is positioned adjacent a coolant jacket. The thermoelectric element is operable to generate an electric current in response to a temperature gradient between the interior wall, which is exposed to the high temperatures of the combustion chamber, and the exterior wall, which is exposed to the cooler temperatures of a coolant in the coolant jacket. An electric current in a circuit of the thermoelectric element may be controlled to affect a cylinder wall temperature. The circuit of the thermoelectric element may be opened, and the voltage of the thermoelectric element may be measured and used to calculate the cylinder wall temperature.
