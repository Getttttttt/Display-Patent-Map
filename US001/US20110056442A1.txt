abstract
    A direct contact rotating steam generator apparatus has an enclosure with an interior volume with a steam producing section. The enclosure has a water injection inlet and a steam outlet and a waste discharge outlet. The enclosure is mounted in an orientation in which the longitudinal axis is slightly inclined to horizontal. The water injection inlet is positioned at one end of the enclosure. The waste discharge outlet is positioned at an opposite end to enclosure. The interior volume has a controllable pressure therein. The enclosure is rotatable about the longitudinal axis thereof.
