abstract
    A thermal management system for a vehicle may be selectively controlled to supply heat from any one of a plurality of different heat sources, to any one of a plurality of different heat sinks. The heat sources may include: an internal combustion engine, a cylinder head, an exhaust gas heat recovery system, an exhaust gas recirculation system, or a turbocharging system. The heat sinks may include: the internal combustion engine, the cylinder heat, an engine oil cooler, a transmission oil cooler, and a heating core. Each of an engine oil cooler control valve, a transmission oil cooler control valve, a heating core control valve, an engine block control valve, a cylinder head control valve, a bypass control valve, and a heat transfer control valve are controlled to effectuate a desired operating mode for the thermal management system.
