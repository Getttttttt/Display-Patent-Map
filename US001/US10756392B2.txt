abstract
    According to one embodiment, a secondary battery is provided. The secondary battery includes a negative electrode, a positive electrode, a first aqueous electrolyte, a second aqueous electrolyte, and a partition having a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface. The partition is positioned between the negative electrode and the positive electrode. The first aqueous electrolyte is in contact with the first surface of the partition and the negative electrode. The second aqueous electrolyte is in contact with the second surface of the partition and the positive electrode. The partition contains a solid electrolyte having alkali metal ion conductivity. The first aqueous electrolyte includes an organic compound.
