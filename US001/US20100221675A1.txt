abstract
    A boiler and method of operating a boiler are disclosed. The boiler generally includes a housing defining an enclosed region and a plurality of heat exchange conduits at least partially positioned within the enclosed region of the housing and arranged into an interior column and an exterior column. A baffle is at least partially positioned within the enclosed region of the housing and positioned between the interior column and the exterior column of heat exchange conduits. The baffle and the housing together define a constricted region. The heat exchange conduits of the exterior column are positioned within the constricted region. The constricted region defines a path for directing the flow of products of combustion adjacent the heat exchange conduits of the exterior column thereby facilitating the exchange of heat between the products of combustion and water within the heat exchange conduit of the exterior column.
