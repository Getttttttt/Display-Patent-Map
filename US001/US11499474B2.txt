abstract
    A power generation system for a nuclear reactor includes an externally-heated turbine engine, a reactor heat exchanger, and a heat recuperating system. The externally-heated turbine engine produces compressed air that is heated by the reactor heat exchanger. The heat recuperating system includes a heat exchanger thermally connected to the externally-heated turbine engine to transfer heat to the compressed air to supplement the reactor heat exchanger.
