abstract
    A heat exchange apparatus cools air supplied from a compressor to a turbine and includes a shell housing; a heat exchanger coupled to an outer surface of the shell housing and configured to cool air passing through an air channel of the heat exchanger using a coolant passing through a coolant channel; a flow guide installed in the shell housing and connected to the air channel of the heat exchanger in order to pass the cooled air into the shell housing, the flow guide having a distal end spaced apart from an inner surface of the shell housing; and at least one air discharge port installed through a sidewall of the shell housing to communicate with the air channel via the flow guide. The heat exchanger is a printed board type including a first plate and a second plate and is formed by alternately stacking the first and second plates.
