abstract
    The disclosure describes, in one aspect, a method of braking a machine having an electric drive configuration. The electric drive configuration includes at least one electric retarding system connected to a first set of wheels. Additionally, a first friction brake system connects to the first set of wheels to provide a braking output torque. A second friction brake system connects to a second set of wheels and provides a second braking output torque. The system calculates and applies a braking ratio between the electric and friction braking systems based upon both user controls and conditions encountered.
