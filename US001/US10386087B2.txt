abstract
    A method of defrosting an energy recovery ventilator unit. The method comprises defrosting an energy recovery ventilator unit. The method comprises activating a defrost process of an enthalpy-exchange zone of the energy recovery ventilator unit when an air-flow blockage in the enthalpy-exchange zone coincides with a frost threshold in the ambient environment surrounding the energy recovery ventilator unit. The method also comprises terminating the defrost process when a heat transfer efficiency across the enthalpy-exchange zone returns to within 10 percent of a pre-frosting heat transfer efficiency wherein, the heat transfer efficiency is proportional to a temperature difference between an intake air zone of the energy recovery ventilator and a supply air zone of the energy recovery ventilator divided by a temperature difference between an return air zone of the energy recovery ventilator and the intake air zone.
