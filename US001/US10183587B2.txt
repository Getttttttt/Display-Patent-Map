abstract
    A power supply system includes a first energy storage, a second energy storage, a power transmission circuit, and circuitry. The circuitry is configured to acquire a remaining capacity and a temperature of the second energy storage. The circuitry is configured to determine a target remaining capacity range of the second energy storage in accordance with the temperature. The circuitry is configured to control the power transmission circuit to control power transmission among the electric load, the first energy storage, and the second energy storage such that the remaining capacity of the second energy storage is within the target remaining capacity range.
