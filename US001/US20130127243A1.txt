abstract
    A power converter includes positive and negative input lines and an input capacitor coupled across the input lines. The power converter also includes a switch coupled across the input lines that includes a control contact and an additional contact. The power converter also includes switch controller coupled to the control contact and that includes positive and negative input connections. The power converter also includes a contactor diagnostic supply interface coupled between the positive input connection and the additional contact.
