abstract
    A charge planning apparatus that formulates a control plan for controlling both of a motor and a generator in a hybrid vehicle performs a control plan re-formulation by changing a control index that provides a basis for state of charge (SOC) estimation, when a modification of the control plan based on a current SOC during the travel of the hybrid vehicle results in an excessive charging or discharging portion in a transition of the modified SOC estimation.
