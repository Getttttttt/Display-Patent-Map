abstract
    Various embodiments relate to combined heat and power (CHP) systems. A CHP system can include a turbine system, a turbocharger system, and a refrigeration system. The refrigeration system can receive combustion products from the turbine system and compressed air from the turbocharger system. The refrigeration system can cool the combustion products and the compressed air to generate a cooled combustion product mixture that is provided to the turbine system.
