abstract
    A method for regulating a drag torque of a motor vehicle driven by an electric motor, a regulating device influencing the drag torque in response to a corresponding change in the setting of the accelerator, a sensor device sensing a tire on a roadway surface on which the motor vehicle is located, and providing this to a computing device, whereupon the computing device causes the regulating device to adjust the drag torque as a function of the coefficient of friction. The present invention also relates to a device having means suitable for carrying out such a method.
