abstract
    Certain exemplary embodiments can provide a system, machine, device, and/or manufacture that is configured for operably releasing condensate from a furnace combustion gas containment system without allowing a substantial quantity of drain air to enter the condensate producing system from a drain or a substantial quantity of combustion gas to flow through the system, machine, device, and/or manufacture.
