abstract
    A method and an apparatus for controlling a hybrid electric vehicle are disclosed. The method includes: determining whether an uphill section is present on a driving route; calculating a regenerative braking amount at a downhill section following the uphill section; determining whether a state of charge (SOC) of a low voltage battery is equal to or greater than a first predetermined value at the time of entering the uphill section; determining whether an SOC of a high voltage battery is equal to or greater than a second predetermined value when the SOC of the low voltage battery is equal to or greater than the first predetermined value; and controlling the MHSG to generate auxiliary torque corresponding to the regenerative braking amount at the downhill section when the SOC of the high voltage battery is equal to or greater than the second predetermined value.
