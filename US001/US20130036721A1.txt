abstract
    A regenerative heat exchanger for transferring heat from the exhaust gas to the intake working fluid of a prime mover and from the pressurized working fluid to the exhaust vapor of a heat pump. Application is especially useful in a system in which liquid air or nitrogen made by a heat pump provides compression cooling for a gas turbine prime mover. The heat exchanger employs circulating element heat transfer surface such as wire belts or ceramic balls, which circulate in turn through working fluid exhaust and intake channels while absorbing and rejecting heat between the two channels. Effectiveness exceeding 98% increases thermal efficiency of small low-pressure ratio gas turbines.
