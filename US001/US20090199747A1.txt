abstract
    A biomass burner system includes a burner assembly, a fuel storage assembly coupled to the burner assembly, and a heat exchanger configured to receive the heat from the burner assembly. The biomass burner system includes a controller which is programmable to monitor various operating conditions of the biomass burner and control the operation of the biomass burner to confirm safe and efficient operation. The controller is operable to monitor a temperature associated with the combustion chamber, a temperature associated with the heat exchanger, and a temperature associated with the air exiting the system. The biomass burner system is operable to vary the flow of air into the combustion chamber, the flow of fuel into the combustion chamber, the operation of an igniter system to maintain the efficient operation of the biomass burner system.
