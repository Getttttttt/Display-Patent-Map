abstract
    An air conditioner apparatus includes an exhaust pipe having a first end in communication with exhaust gas from an exhaust generating device disposed in a first atmosphere with a first temperature, and a second end discharging the exhaust gas to a second atmosphere with a second temperature; an inlet pipe substantially surrounding the exhaust pipe, the inlet pipe spaced apart from the exhaust pipe for providing a space therebetween and having a first end in communication with the first atmosphere and a second end in communication with the second atmosphere and through which the second atmosphere is introduced into the space; and a guide assembly disposed in the space for guiding the second atmosphere through the space for heat transfer with the exhaust gas moving through the exhaust pipe.
