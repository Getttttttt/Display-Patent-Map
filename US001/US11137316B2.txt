abstract
    A structure for detecting a leak, wherein the structure is supported upon a supporting surface, the structure including a leak detector; and a bottom-facing surface comprising an inverted depression in which the leak detector is disposed, the inverted depression is configured to be suitable for inducing capillary actions in a liquid collected on the supporting surface, wherein when the inverted depression comes in contact with the liquid at its periphery, the liquid is drawn to the leak detector to be detected.
