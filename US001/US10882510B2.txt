abstract
    Systems and methods are provided for determining an optimal point during operation of a hybrid electric vehicle towing a trailer at which the energy that can be recouped through regenerative braking is maximized. Operating conditions or characteristics of the hybrid electric vehicle and the brake characteristics of the trailer are considered in determining the optimal point at which the energy that can be recouped is maximized. At the optimal point at which the energy that can be recouped is maximized, the engine of the hybrid electric vehicle is turned off. Otherwise, the engine of the hybrid electric vehicle is left on.
