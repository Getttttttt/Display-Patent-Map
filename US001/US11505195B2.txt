abstract
    A vehicle includes a powertrain having an electric machine configured to power driven wheels, an accelerator pedal, and a brake pedal. A controller is programmed to, in response to driver-demanded torque corresponding to a position of the accelerator pedal, selectively brake the vehicle via operation of the electric machine, in further response to a speed of the vehicle being greater than a threshold, limit a rate of change of the driver-demanded torque commanded to the powertrain based on a first rate limit, and, in further response to the speed being less than another threshold, limit a rate of change of the driver-demanded torque commanded to the powertrain based on a second rate limit that is higher than the first rate limit such that, for a given driver-demanded torque, acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle is more responsive than when the first rate limit is applied.
