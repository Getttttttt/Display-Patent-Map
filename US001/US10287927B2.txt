abstract
    A Rankine cycle system for a vehicle having a dual fluid circulation circuit includes a high temperature (HT) loop in which a HT working fluid is converted to steam by heat of exhaust gas discharged from an engine. The steam is condensed back into the liquid state of the HT working fluid. A Low Temperature (LT) loop in which a temperature of an LT working fluid converted to steam is increased so that power is generated while the LT working fluid cools the HT working fluid in the HT loop, and the steam is condensed back into the liquid state of the LT working fluid. An engine coolant circulation auxiliary line forming a circulation flow in which engine coolant heats the LT working fluid and is then returned to the engine after the engine coolant circulated in the engine is supplied to the LT loop.
