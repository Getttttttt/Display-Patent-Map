abstract
    A heat transfer system is adapted for transferring heat between two different ducts in a ventilation system. The system has a heat pipe having a plurality of conduits. Each conduit including an evaporator section extending laterally from a first open end of the respective conduit, a condenser section extending laterally from a second open end of the respective conduit, and a liquid return section. The liquid return section of at least one conduit being distinct from the liquid return section of another of the conduits. A common vapor manifold is in fluid communication with and extends between the first and second open ends of each of said plurality of conduits so vapors produced in the evaporator sections can flow from the first open ends through the common vapor manifold to the second open ends without flowing through the conduits.
