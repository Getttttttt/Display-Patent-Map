abstract
    Described herein are gradual oxidation systems that receive and process solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels. The system can include a solid fuel gasifier that extracts and cleans gas fuel from a solid fuel. The system can also include a reaction chamber that receives the gas fuel and maintains a gradual oxidation process of the fuel. In some embodiments, liquids containing contaminants can be oxidized within the gradual oxidation chamber. Liquid fuels and gas fuels may be communicated to the oxidation chamber separately or in combination.
