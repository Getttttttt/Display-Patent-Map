abstract
    A method of controlling the braking of a vehicle descending a slope. The method includes receiving one or more electrical signals each indicative of a value of a respective vehicle-related parameter. The method further includes detecting that the vehicle is descending a slope based on the value(s) of one or more of the vehicle-related parameters. The method still further includes automatically modifying an amount of brake torque being applied to at least certain of the wheels of the vehicle in response to the detection of the vehicle descending a slope by increasing the amount of brake torque being applied to one or more trailing wheels of the vehicle, and decreasing the amount of brake torque being applied to one or more leading wheels of the vehicle.
