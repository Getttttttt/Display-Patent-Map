abstract
    A driving power control apparatus for a vehicle having an internal combustion engine and an electric motor includes a charge specifying unit and a schedule specifying unit. When determining that congestion exists ahead based on received wireless information, the charge specifying unit specifies a required charge quantity of a battery, which is needed at a congestion start, such that a charge quantity of the battery remains more than a predetermined quantity at a congestion end after traveling through the congestion using the motor. The schedule specifying unit extracts a partial section in advance of the congestion start. The schedule specifying unit further specifies a schedule of a control index in the partial section, such that the charge quantity of the battery at the congestion start is more than the required charge quantity.
