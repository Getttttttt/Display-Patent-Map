abstract
    A heat recovery system that includes at least one an engine, a radiator, an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and a thermo-electric generator (TEG). The radiator may be coupled to the reciprocating engine, and the ORC may be coupled to the reciprocating engine and to the TEG. A control module in the system is configured to divert reciprocating engine jacket water fluid through any of the radiator, ORC and TEG to increase the energy efficiency of the reciprocating engine through heat recovery caused by the diverted fluid.
