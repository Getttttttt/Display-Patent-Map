abstract
    A control method of a dual clutch transmission for a hybrid electric vehicle includes: determining, by a transmission controller, whether a vehicle has entered a power-off down-shift state; determining, by the transmission controller, whether a transmission including a first input shaft, a second input shaft, and an output shaft has entered a torque phase, when the first determining step determines that the vehicle has entered the power-off down-shift state; calculating a compensatory torque for compensating for a change in a regenerative braking force according to a change of a gear ratio in accordance with a completion percentage of the torque phase, when it is determined that a transmission has entered the torque phase; and compensating for regenerative torque of a motor by applying the compensatory torque.
