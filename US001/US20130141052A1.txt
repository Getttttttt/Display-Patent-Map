abstract
    A system for storing electrical energy having several storage cells, each storage cell having an operating voltage, an electrical load and a switching element connected in series with each storage cell. The switching element being closed when a threshold voltage of the storage cell is reached or exceeded. The system including at least one module having several storage cells and a control device. The control device being configured to assign a temperature to individual storage cells and a module voltage to the module. The control device being further configured to alter the threshold voltage of the individual storage cells dependant upon the assigned temperature whilst maintaining the module voltage.
