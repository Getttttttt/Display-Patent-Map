abstract
    A water heater with two non-condensing flues and a condensing flue(s) having a system to prevent condensation in the non-condensing flue(s). The downwardly extending first flue is connected by a 180 degree connector to an upwardly extending second flue. Between the non-condensing and the condensing flues is positioned a temperature sensor. A controller receives input from the temperature sensor and is connected to the burner to control the minimum power setting and duration so as to prevent the combustion gases from falling below a temperature at which water will condense at the temperature sensor so no condensation occurs in the first two flues. Burner power settings are minimized near a water tank setpoint to improve efficiency by increasing condensation.
