abstract
    A braking control method includes steps of: (i) confirming whether to enter a blending section where regenerative braking torque is reduced and friction braking torque is increased; (ii) determining a target reduced deceleration by a controller upon entering the blending section; (iii) reducing braking torque of a vehicle in response to the determined target reduced deceleration; and (iv) returning the braking torque of the vehicle to driver's requested braking torque when the vehicle is being stopped.
