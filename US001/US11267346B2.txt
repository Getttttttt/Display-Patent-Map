abstract
    A vehicle includes first and second electric machines driven by inverters and coupled to first and second sets of wheels. The vehicle includes switches configured to selectively connect each of the electric machines in one of a wye and a delta connection. The vehicle further includes a controller programmed to operate the switches to select a connection for the electric machines and operate the inverters to proportion a torque demand between the electric machines based on speed of the vehicle.
