abstract
    Methods and systems employing the same for controlling braking characteristics of a vehicle are provided. Expected braking characteristics of the vehicle are received and driving condition data is continuously received. A determination as to whether the expected braking characteristics can be safely applied in view of the driving condition data is continuously made and the expected braking characteristics are applied when they can be applied safely.
