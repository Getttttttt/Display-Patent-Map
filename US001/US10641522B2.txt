abstract
    The present invention relates to a heat exchanger having a simplified assembly structure as well as a simplified structure for heat-insulating a combustion chamber, the heat exchanger being provided with a heat exchange unit having heating medium flow channels through which a heating medium flows and combustion gas flow channels through which combustion gas combusted in the burner flows to be alternately formed and adjacent to each other in spaces between a plurality of plates, wherein the heat exchange unit comprises: a sensible heat unit which surrounds the outer side of a combustion chamber, is formed of one side area of the plates, and heats the heating medium by using sensible heat of combustion gas generated by the combustion of the burner; and a latent heat unit which is formed of the other side area of the plates, and heats the heating medium by using latent heat of water vapor included in combustion gas that has finished undergoing heat exchange in the sensible heat unit, wherein the rear of the sensible heat unit has provided thereon connection flow channels of the heating medium so that the heating medium that passed through the heating medium flow channels of the latent heat unit can flow to the heating medium flow channels of the sensible heat unit, and the rear of the sensible heat unit also has a water housing cooling unit formed thereon for heat-insulating the combustion chamber.
