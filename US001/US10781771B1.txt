abstract
    The present invention discloses an automatic cooling system based on stirling engine for combustion engine. The system is configured to utilize thermal energy from the temperature difference between the engine and a radiator to feed the stirling engine. The stirling engine drives a coolant pump to circulate a coolant between the engine and the radiator. If the temperature difference between the combustion engine and the radiator is high, the stirling engine automatically drives the coolant pump and circulates the coolant at high speed. If the temperature difference between the combustion engine and the radiator is low, the stirling engine automatically drives the coolant pump and circulates the coolant at low speed, until the temperature difference between the engine and radiator within a threshold point. Therefore, there is no need for a thermostat and a water pump coupled with the engine.
