abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery system may include an exhaust pipe through which exhaust gas exhausted from an engine moves, a main channel through which a working fluid moves, a turbine rotated by the working fluid exhausted from the main channel to generate energy, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) line circulating a portion of the exhaust gas exhausted from the engine to an intake manifold, and channel control valves disposed in the main channel and configured to control movement of the working fluid so that the exhaust gas moving along the EGR line and the working fluid moving along the main channel exchange heat with each other.
