abstract
    Disclosed is a combustion machine, including: a hopper, a drying mechanism and a combustion mechanism. The hopper is configured for storing materials and conveying the materials to the drying mechanism. The drying mechanism includes a conveying mechanism and a drying chamber, and the conveying mechanism is connected with the hopper and conveys the materials in the hopper to the drying chamber. The combustion mechanism includes a combustion chamber connected with the drying chamber via a material conveying pipeline, and a fire outlet pipe arranged in the combustion chamber and used for outputting flame. A hot air pipeline is connected between the combustion chamber and the drying chamber, and a first exhaust fan is arranged in the hot air pipeline.
