abstract
    A power system includes a first solar power assembly that includes a first working fluid fluidly coupled to one or more components of an industrial process; a second solar power assembly that includes a second working fluid fluidly coupled to an electrical power generation system that is electrically coupled to the one or more components of the industrial process; and a heat recovery system that includes a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger includes an inlet fluidly coupled to at least one of the one or more components of the industrial process to receive waste heat from the at least one of the one or more components of the industrial process, and an outlet fluidly coupled to at least another of the one or more components of the industrial process to supply the waste heat to the at least another of the one or more components of the industrial process.
