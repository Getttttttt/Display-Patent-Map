abstract
    An apparatus is provided and arranged with an air control system to alternately direct a first and a second airflow to a first and a second energy-absorbing body in order to achieve a heat and moisture transfer between the two airflows. The energy exchange bodies alternate between recovery and release modes such that when one energy exchange body is in the release mode the other is in the recovery mode. Each of the first and second energy absorbing bodies is divided into a first latent energy recovery portion which includes a moisture absorbent material so that it is arranged to absorb latent energy and a second sensible energy recovery portion which is substantially free from moisture absorbent material so as to absorb primarily sensible energy.
