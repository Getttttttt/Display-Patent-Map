abstract
    An energy separation and recovery system wherein exhaust heat from an automotive engine source which might otherwise be wasted is employed in conjunction with a heat exchanger and a super heater to generate steam in a substantially closed-loop system wherein the heat supply is an open system. The superheated steam is transmitted to an engine to generate power which may be used to supply electrical energy. The electrical energy may be employed external to the system or may be used to assist the motive engine in providing motive power to the vehicle. Stepped diameter tubing carries water, or other vaporizable fluids, through the heat exchanger into the super heater while simultaneously exposing the carried water or fluid to incrementally higher temperature heated gas. Variable bellows, attached operatively to end plates accommodate the differential expansion of the tubing. The energy generation system includes a control module to permit the generation of steam and electricity at such times as there is sufficient heat to permit the generation of superheated steam.
