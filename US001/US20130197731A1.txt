abstract
    Methods and systems are disclosed for controlling an electric vehicle. The method includes determining that the vehicle is stopped on a slope in an unparked mode without an accelerator or brake request. A holding force may be applied to hold the vehicle in the stopped position on the slope. After the vehicle has been stopped on the slope in the unparked mode without an accelerator or brake request for a predetermined amount of time, the holding force may be reduced to remind a driver that the vehicle is in the unparked mode.
