abstract
    A drain pipe 54 includes an upper end portion 54 a which is connected to a concave 38 a of a leading end 38 of an exhaust tube 34, and a lower end portion 54 b which is opened to the inside of a warm air furnace below the concave 38 a. The lower end portion 54 b is formed as a tubular portion where a membrane is formed at a plane orthogonal to an axis line 54 d by a surface tension of a drain. A leading end 54 e of the tubular portion is formed as an opening 54 f with an area large enough such that the membrane is not generated by the surface tension of the drain.
