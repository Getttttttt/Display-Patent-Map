abstract
    Systems and methods are provided for a turbocharger system for use with a process gas capture system. In one example, the turbocharger system comprises: a heat exchanger positioned to receive inlet gas from a gas generating system via a first inlet; a low pressure compressor driven by a low pressure turbine and coupled to a first outlet of the heat exchanger; a mid-pressure compressor driven by a mid-pressure turbine and coupled in series with the low pressure compressor, the mid-pressure compressor configured to receive low pressure compressed gas from the low pressure compressor; and a high pressure compressor driven by a high pressure turbine and coupled in series with the mid-pressure compressor, the high pressure compressor configured to receive mid-pressure compressed gas from the mid-pressure compressor and output high pressure compressed gas to the process gas capture system and a second inlet of the heat exchanger.
