abstract
    An electric car system for use in transporting users from one location to another at speeds of up to 70 MPH. Electric car system comprises a frame, a steering system, a braking system, a suspension system, and a body. An electronic drive system controller is located near the operator's controls comprising a touch screen for selecting forward, reverse, and security movement lock position(s). The drive assembly comprises at least one accessory battery charged by an accessory alternator, at least one drive assembly battery charged by a drive assembly alternator, and an electric drive motor. The accessory battery powers car accessories and provides redundant electricity to the drive assembly battery when needed. The drive assembly battery provides power to the electric drive motor. The electric drive motor provides torque to two half shafts which couple to front axles and front rotatable wheels in front-wheel drive versions.
