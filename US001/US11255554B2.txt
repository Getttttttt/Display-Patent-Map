abstract
    A dehumidifying system includes an enclosure having at least one opening disposed at a first end and at least one opening disposed at a second end. A plurality of air paths that extend through the enclosure and are separated from one another by partitions along at least a portion of the enclosure. A dehumidifier evaporator is disposed within the enclosure and configured such that at least one of the air paths is disposed to flow through the dehumidifier evaporator. The dehumidifier evaporator includes a dehumidifying coil and a heat pipe assembly at least partially wrapping around the dehumidification coil.
