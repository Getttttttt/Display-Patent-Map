abstract
    A vehicle includes an axle, an electric machine, a first wheel, a second wheel, a first friction brake, a second friction brake, and a controller. The controller is programmed to, in response to and during an anti-locking braking event, generate first and second signals indicative of a braking torque demand at the first and second wheels, respectively, based on a difference between a desired wheel slip ratio and an actual wheel slip ratio of the first and second wheels, respectively, adjust a regenerative braking torque of the electric machine based on a product of the first signal and a regenerative braking weighting coefficient, adjust a first friction braking torque based on a product of the first signal and a friction braking weighting coefficient, and adjust a second friction braking torque based on the second signal and dynamics of the first and second output shafts.
