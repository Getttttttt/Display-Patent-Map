abstract
    A multi-circulation heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) for steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)/Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes comprises a steam drum internally partitioned to provide a clean side and a dirty side. The clean side downcomer pipe supplies water to one or more generating banks as part of a clean circuit located in a high heat flux zone of the boiler. Boiler water is fed from the clean side of the drum to the dirty side of the drum via natural head differential. Water is then fed through a corresponding downcomer to a dirty generating bank, which is located in a low heat flux zone of the boiler.
