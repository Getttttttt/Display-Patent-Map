abstract
    An exhaust duct for cooling an exhaust flue. One or more modular coolant coils are disposed about the outer circumference of or within the flue interior cavity for thermal communication with exhaust gas. Each coil has a helical spiral profile extending along the flue axial dimension, an interior lumen there through for passage of coolant provided by a cooling system, and a respective inlet and outlet for respective intake and discharge of coolant. Optionally at least one remotely adjustable valve is coupled to the coolant coil and an industrial automation controller, for regulation of coolant flow rate within the coil. The coolant coils may incorporate one or more coolant temperature sensors in communication with the controller. A plurality of exhaust duct cooling coils may be under common control of the controller, for allocation of coolant among the coils and other portions of the cooling system.
