abstract
    A vehicle brake system, wherein an electric brake device is configured such that a clearance exists between a friction member and a rotary body when no braking force request is made, and wherein a controller is configured to: execute, for a hydraulic brake device, from a time point of generation of the request, a braking-force-request-dependent control for generating a hydraulic braking force in accordance with a degree of the request; and execute, for the electric brake device, (a) a clearance removing control for removing the clearance, which is executed from the time point of generation of the request till a time point when the degree increases up to a threshold degree, and (b) a braking-force-request-dependent control for generating an electric braking force in accordance with the degree of the request, the control being executed after the time point when the degree becomes equal to the threshold degree.
