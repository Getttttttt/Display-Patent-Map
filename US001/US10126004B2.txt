abstract
    The present disclosure provides: a method for recycling waste-heat from a heat-dissipation facility, the method comprising: (a) collecting hot waste air generated in the heat-dissipation facility; (b) changing the hot air to cool air to change cool water to hot water; (c) feeding the cool air to the heat-dissipation facility to cool air in the heat-dissipation facility; and (d) increasing a humidity in the heat-dissipation facility using the hot water.
