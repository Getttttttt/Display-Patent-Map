abstract
    A regenerative controller for an electric motor includes: a wheel rotation detection unit provided on a vehicle and detecting a rotation amount of a wheel that is driven via a crank rotated by human power; a crank rotation detection unit that detects a rotation amount of the crank; and a controller that calculates a first value based on the rotation amount of the wheel, a second value based on the rotation amount of the crank, and a control parameter based on at least the second value among the first value and the second value for regenerative control of a power storage device regeneratively charged by an electric motor that supplies driving power to the wheel, the controller controlling a regeneration amount of the electric motor in accordance with the control parameter.
