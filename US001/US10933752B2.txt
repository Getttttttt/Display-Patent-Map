abstract
    A device comprises motor controller coupled to a drive motor and a battery pack of a vehicle. The motor controller comprises a processor that is configured to: determine that the vehicle is engaged in a neutral braking mode, and after determining that the vehicle is engaged in the neutral braking mode: select a neutral braking torque curve, determine a rotational velocity of the drive motor, based on the determined rotational velocity of the drive motor, determine an amount of regenerative braking torque to apply to the drive motor based on the selected neutral braking torque curve, apply the determined amount of regenerative braking torque to the drive motor, wherein applying the determined amount of regenerative braking torque to the drive motor results in a regenerative current generated by the drive motor, and supply the regenerative current to the battery pack to at least partially recharge the battery pack.
