abstract
    A combined heat and power system comprises a shaft (4), a compressor (6) coupled to the shaft to compress intake gas to form compressed gas; a recuperator (10) to heat the compressed gas to form heated compressed gas; a combustor (12) to combust a fuel and the heated compressed gas to form combustion gas; a turbine (8) coupled to the shaft to expand the combustion gas to form exhaust gas; a load (24) coupled to the shaft; an exhaust outlet (18) to expel the exhaust gas to a heater for heating a fluid based on heat from the exhaust gas; a recuperator channel (28) providing a path for the exhaust gas to flow from the turbine to the exhaust outlet through the recuperator; and a bypass channel (22) providing a path for the exhaust gas to flow from the turbine to the exhaust outlet bypassing the recuperator.
