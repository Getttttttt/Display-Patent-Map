abstract
    A charge controller for an electric mining vehicle is configured to determine an amount of charge to be provided to a battery of the electric mining vehicle for an upcoming trip based on regenerative braking power generation and load indication measured during a previous trip. The charge controller is further configured to command a battery charger to charge the battery up to the determined amount of charge and to stop charging the battery once the determined amount of charge has been reached.
