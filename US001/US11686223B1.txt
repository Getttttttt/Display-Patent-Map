abstract
    A system includes an electric generator, a power electronics system, a first heat exchanger, and a second heat exchanger. The electric generator includes a turbine wheel, a rotor, and a stator. The turbine wheel is configured to receive process gas and rotate in response to expansion of the process gas flowing through the electric generator. The rotor is configured to rotate with the turbine wheel. The electric generator is configured to generate electrical power upon rotation of the rotor within the stator. The power electronics system is configured to receive the electrical power from the electric generator and convert the electrical power to specified power characteristics. A heat transfer fluid receives waste heat from the power electronics system through the first heat exchanger. The heat transfer fluid transfers the received waste heat to the process gas through the second heat exchanger.
