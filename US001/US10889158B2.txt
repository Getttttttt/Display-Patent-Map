abstract
    This disclosure relates to a motor vehicle including a climate control system with an accumulator, and a corresponding method. An example motor vehicle includes a powertrain and a climate control system configured to meet a thermal conditioning demand. The climate control system includes an accumulator and a compressor driven by the powertrain. Further, a controller is in electronic communication with the climate control system, and the controller is configured to selectively command the climate control system to charge the accumulator when an amount of energy available to the compressor from the powertrain is in excess of an amount of energy required to meet the thermal conditioning demand.
