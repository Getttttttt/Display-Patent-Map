abstract
    An energy conversion system (ECS) is described for energy conversion and distribution including the conversion of vehicle-stored energy into electrical energy and the distribution of the electrical energy locally at the home or via a utility grid level. The ECS includes a system coupled or connected to a vehicle powertrain and comprising a storage cell, a control and monitoring device, a converter unit that converts direct current (DC) energy to alternating current (AC) energy (also referred to as a converter or as an inverter), and an electric generator which extracts kinetic energy created by a moving object or vehicle, converting it into electric energy. This energy is stored in discrete storage cells in the object or vehicle until it can be downloaded into an electrical distribution system or grid.
