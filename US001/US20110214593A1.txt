abstract
    An eco-friendly system for generating thermal energy from waste biomass comprises a furnace, a set of boiler tubes placed on the top of the furnace, a rectangular or tubular structure housing the boiler tube and the furnace, an outlet for the flue gases leading to a cyclone, said cyclone carrying a tubular body for leading away a part of flue gases and fitted with a butterfly control valve for regulating flow of effluent gases, a tubular body connecting the body to the suction blower, a water tank, a hopper for waste biomass, and a fuel injection blower for introducing fuel inside the furnace by means of pressurized air jet blown through the pipe.
