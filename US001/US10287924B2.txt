abstract
    A combined heat and power plant for the decentralized supply of power and of heat may include at least one prime mover for providing electrical energy while providing waste gas, at least one thermal store for storing thermal energy provided by the waste gas, and at least one high-temperature battery in which the electrical energy provided by the prime mover can be stored. The high-temperature battery can be supplied by the waste gas provided by the prime mover to keep the high-temperature battery warm.
