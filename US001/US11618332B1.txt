abstract
    This disclosure is directed to methods and systems for charging an electric vehicle. A charging system may be used to charge the energy storage devices of an electric vehicle by using the power generation or regeneration systems or devices of the vehicle. The vehicle may access the charging system by positioning one or more wheels of the vehicle adjacent to, or on top of, one or more drive rollers of the charging system. The driver rollers may be rotatably coupled to one or more motors. A controller may control operation of the charging system, including the charging of the vehicle, by causing the motor to cause the drive rollers to rotate. The wheels of the vehicle may rotate in response to rotation of the drive rollers, causing power generation or regeneration systems of the vehicle to generate energy to store in an energy storage device of the vehicle.
