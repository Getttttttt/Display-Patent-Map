abstract
    A carbon dioxide recovery system includes a high-pressure turbine 11, an intermediate-pressure turbine 12, a low-pressure turbine 13, a main boiler 15 that generates steam 14 for driving these turbines, a carbon dioxide recovery unit 24 including a carbon dioxide absorber 21 that absorbs and reduces carbon dioxide in flue gas (emission gas) G emitted from the main boiler 15 using a carbon dioxide absorbent and an absorbent regenerator 23 that regenerates a carbon dioxide absorbent having absorbed the carbon dioxide using a regenerating superheater 22 to obtain a regenerated carbon dioxide absorbent, an auxiliary boiler 30 that generates saturated water vapor 31 to be supplied to the regenerating superheater 22 in the absorbent regenerator 23, and a steam turbine 32 that is driven by steam from the auxiliary boiler 30.
