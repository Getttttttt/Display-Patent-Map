abstract
    An initial variation learning control is executed when a learning condition is satisfied each time the learning condition is satisfied, with the aim of absorbing initial variations of manufacturing errors or variations of components of a second clutch (CL2). When the number of times of learning control is counted and this becomes a predetermined number (e.g. five times), after that, a deterioration variation learning control, which is equivalent to the initial variation learning control, is executed only once a trip from ON of a key switch to OFF of the key switch. With this, a frequency of execution of the learning control can be reduced, and the number of times of the learning can be reduced. It is therefore possible to suppress energy consumption and improve energy efficiency in stand-by pressure learning control of the second clutch that serves as a starter clutch.
