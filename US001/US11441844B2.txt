abstract
    This disclosure provides a method of recycling heat during operation of a plant in which equipment for processing at least two different materials is co-located. The method comprises a first process for processing a first material and a second process for processing a second material. The second material has a melting point that is less than a melting point of the first material. During the first process, the first material is subjected to a first melting process and then subjected to a first cooling process that includes solidification of the first material. During the second process, the second material is subjected to a second melting process and then subjected to a second cooling process that includes solidification of the second material. The method comprises recovering heat from the first cooling process and using at least some of the heat as a heat source for the second melting process.
