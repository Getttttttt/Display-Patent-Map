abstract
    An apparatus for sanitizing and deodorizing air. The apparatus includes: a chamber including an inlet adapted to receive contaminated air, an outlet adapted to transport heated air, a baffle adapted to increase the length of a path traveled by air in the chamber, and an ash removal device adapted to remove ash from the chamber; and at least one combustor, wherein the combustor is adapted to combust a fuel to heat the air in the chamber so that the air is sterilized and deodorized, thereby generating such ash.
