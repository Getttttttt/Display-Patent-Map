abstract
    Disclosed are power generation apparatuses. An exemplary power generation apparatus (1) is configured such that water vapor generated in a steam generator (2) is supplied to a scroll expander (3) to drive the scroll expander, wherein: a condensation device (5) is arranged in a discharge path (12) downstream of the scroll expander, the condensation device being configured to mix water vapor having passed through the scroll expander directly with cooling water to condense the water vapor; and the condensation device includes a control unit (10) that performs a control of adjusting the amount of cooling water supply so as to obtain condensed water having a predetermined temperature.
