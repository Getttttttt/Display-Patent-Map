abstract
    Disclosed is a heat exchanger, and a method for heating a working fluid. The heat exchanger includes a burner, a combustion section, and a condenser section positioned below the combustion section such that exhaust from the burner passes through the spiral coils and to the condenser. In an example of this disclosure, the combustion section includes a plurality of spiral coils radially spaced apart relative to one another, and the condenser section includes a plurality of U-bend coils.
