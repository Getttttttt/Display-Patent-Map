abstract
    A waste heat recovery system for recovering rejected heat of an internal combustion engine includes a turbine expander. The turbine expander outputs power based on a working fluid and includes a turbine blade that is rotatable by the working fluid, a shaft that is coupled to and rotatable by the turbine blade and extends along a longitudinal axis, and a nozzle assembly for directing the working fluid to the turbine blade for rotating the turbine blade. The nozzle assembly includes a nozzle housing disposed about the shaft and adjacent the turbine blade, and a nozzle for accelerating the working fluid. The nozzle component defines a nozzle throat having a geometrical configuration. The waste heat recovery system further includes a passive control coupled to the nozzle component for directing the working fluid.
