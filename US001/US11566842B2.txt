abstract
    A cement manufacturing plant can include at least one emission abatement mechanism. In some embodiments, the emission abatement mechanism can utilize a plurality of pulsed gases passed through a reactor to treat a solid particulate material passed through the reactor. The pulsed reactant gas can be pulsed through the reactor so that the pulsed gas passes from a middle portion of the reactor to a first end of the reactor at which the solid particulates can be fed into the reactor. In some embodiments, the reactant gas can be output from the first end to a down corner or other reactant gas conduit for transport to a treatment device.
