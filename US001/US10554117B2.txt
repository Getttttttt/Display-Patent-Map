abstract
    The invention relates to an electric converter (30) for a substation feeding an electric grid and/or for recuperating the braking energy of rail vehicles traveling on a railroad track, the substation being connected to a feeder line able to supply a DC voltage to the rail vehicles traveling on the railroad track, the substation comprising an electricity distribution grid able to deliver a corresponding three-phase voltage with three phases, the converter (30) comprising a transformer (306) able to inspect the value of the three-phase voltage delivered by the electricity distribution grid, a filtering device (304) able to filter the three-phase voltage of the transformer (306), and an inverter (302) connected to the filter (304).
