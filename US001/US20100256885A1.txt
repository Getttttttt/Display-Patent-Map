abstract
    A method that compensates for fluid pressure variations in a vehicle brake system so that the fluid pressure, brake torque and/or brake force at the wheel more accurately reflects that requested by the driver. In an exemplary embodiment, the method determines the braking intent of the driver, determines a current stage of the braking event (e.g., an apply stage, release stage, etc.), uses the braking event stage and the driver braking intent to select a pressure compensation, and uses the pressure compensation to generate compensated brake command signals for operating the vehicle brake system. This method is well suited for use with brake-by-wire systems, such as an electrohydraulic braking (EHB) system.
