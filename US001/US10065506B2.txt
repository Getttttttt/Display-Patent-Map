abstract
    A vehicle includes a friction brake, a regenerative brake, and an ECU. The ECU is configured to: (a) control a total braking force that is generated in the vehicle; (b) execute first brake control for controlling a braking force of the vehicle on the basis of the brake operation amount; (c) determine based on the brake operation amount whether the driver's brake operation is being carried out; (d) when the ECU determines that the driver's brake operation is not being carried out, execute second brake control for automatically controlling the braking force of the vehicle in response to a condition of the vehicle, other than the brake operation amount; and (e) when the second brake control is executed, reduce a proportion of a braking force of the regenerative brake within the total braking force as compared to when the first brake control is executed.
