abstract
    A plate fin for a heat exchanger is provided including a base plate having a plurality of holes formed therein. The plate fin also includes a plurality of generally annular collars. Each collar is positioned substantially coaxially within one of the plurality of holes. The plurality of first collars is substantially less than the plurality of holes such that a portion of the plurality of holes does not have a collar arranged therein.
