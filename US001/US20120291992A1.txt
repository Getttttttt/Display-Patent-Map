abstract
    A system transfers thermal energy between incoming supply air and outgoing exhaust air. The system comprises: at least four rotary heat exchange units positioned in an array so that incoming supply air and outgoing exhaust air passes through each of the wheels as counter flowing air streams; and partitions defining at least three pathways for directing the counter flowing air streams through the rotary heat exchange units. A method of transferring thermal energy between incoming supply air and outgoing exhaust air is also described. The method comprises: positioning at least four rotary heat exchange units in an array in an air transfer system so that incoming supply air and outgoing exhaust air passes through each of the wheels as counter flowing air streams; and defining at least three pathways for directing the counter flowing air streams through the rotary heat exchange units.
