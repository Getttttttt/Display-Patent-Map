abstract
    A system designed to introduce fresh air ventilation into the living space, eliminate contaminants, and add fresh air to augment a building's HVAC system. This is done in order to save energy, and the costs associated with heat loss in a building. The system employs the use of geothermal energy conferred to air via a cavity which is constructed in the basement, on the slab, in the crawl space and/or attic of a building. This cavity is created to circulate to absorb the geo and/or solar characteristics of a building, taking advantage of the consistent subterranean temperature of the earth and/or sun, in order to warm air from outside during the winter minimizing a heat sink, and cool air during the summer. One or more heat exchangers are used to transfer the energy from contaminated air in the cavity to clean air destined for the HVAC system.
