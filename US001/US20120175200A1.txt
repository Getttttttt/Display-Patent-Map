abstract
    A system is provided for customized vehicle deceleration. The system includes a braking system and a brake pedal position sensor that transmits a brake pedal position signal. A user interface is configured for transmitting a profile selection signal in response to a user input. A controller is configured for receiving the brake pedal position signal, the profile selection signal and an available torque signal, the available torque signal being indicative of a braking system torque capability. The controller analyzes the profile selection signal, to select a brake profile from pre-existing data. The controller compares the brake pedal position signal to the brake profile to determine a deceleration value. The controller compares the deceleration value to the available torque signal to determine a torque command. The controller transmits a torque command signal to the braking system for initiating braking.
