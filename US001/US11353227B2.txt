abstract
    Method and device for reducing or eliminating a temperature drop of the supply air temperature during defrost operation, at an air handling unit (1) which is arranged with a heat pump (2) for recovering heat from an extract air stream (3) and transfer to a supply air stream (4). During defrosting of a first DX-coil (5), arranged in the extract air stream (3), by reversible operation of the heat pump (2), accumulated heat energy (E) is used for reduction or elimination of the temperature drop in the supply air temperature during the defrost operation, and which energy has been stored in an accumulator medium (7) which is at least partially in contact with the supply air flow (4). The stored energy (E) is delivered by heat exchange with the supply air stream (4) in a position after a second DX-coil (6) through a heating coil (8) arranged in the supply air stream (4).
