abstract
    A building heating system with cycling steam source used for plurality of radiators is provided. During heating cycle condensate is retained in radiators and released later through steam supply line. Such condensate and steam flows alternation eliminates water hammering and justify usage of smaller diameter tubes and new radiator design. When air is evacuated, system operates like branched heat pipe with periodic condensate return. System may include vacuum check valve on air vent lines and operational procedure to create vacuum naturally by steam condensing in a closed space after complete air purging from the system. Steam/vapor source's cut off pressure can be adjusted to regulate the vapor's temperature depending on the outside temperature. Method is proposed for conversion of the existing steam heating systems into a vapor/vacuum system with naturally induced vacuum.
