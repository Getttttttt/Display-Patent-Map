abstract
    A dielectrically insulated secondary tubular flue for mounting inside a water holding tank of a gas-fired water heater is provided to increase the efficiency of the water heater. The secondary tubular flue has opposed tubular end sections and an helical tubular section integrally formed therewith. The tubular end sections each have connecting end sections adapted to form a part of a dielectric connector for securing the secondary tubular flue inside of the water holding tank by the dielectric connectors.
