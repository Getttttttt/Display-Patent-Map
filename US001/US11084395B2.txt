abstract
    A battery management system for a vehicle, a battery management method thereof and a vehicle including the same, which can vary a state of charge (SOC) of a battery in accordance with a location of a recharging station are disclosed. The battery management system includes: a position information acquisition unit for acquiring position information of a recharging station and the vehicle; a storage for storing a hilly area recharging station list comprising position information of hilly area recharging stations and learned full SOC values; and a controller for controlling the position information acquisition unit and the storage. The controller checks whether a recharging station where recharging of the vehicle is executed is a hilly area recharging station, and restricts a full SOC in order to avoid restriction of regenerative braking according to downhill road travel, thereby enhancing fuel economy and safety.
