abstract
    Disclosed herein is a vehicle control system capable of improving driving stability and providing safe fun driving to a driver by varying and controlling a regenerative braking torque generated by a motor during coasting. The vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the disclosure includes: a motor configured to provide a driving force to a wheel; a wheel sensor configured to detect a rotational speed of the wheel; and a controller configured to control the motor to generate a first regenerative braking torque during coasting, and to control the motor to generate a second regenerative braking torque lower than the first regenerative braking torque when a wheel slip of the wheel is detected based on an output of the wheel sensor.
