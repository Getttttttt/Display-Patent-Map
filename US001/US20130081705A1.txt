abstract
    A system for evacuating gas from a brake booster of a motor vehicle includes: a first conduit adapted to be connected fluidly to the brake booster; an electric pump connected fluidly to the first conduit, and controllable to evacuate gas from the brake booster via the first conduit; a second conduit; an electric valve fluidly connecting the first and second conduits to each other; a mechanical pump connected fluidly to the second conduit, and adapted to be driven by a vehicle drive unit of the motor vehicle to evacuate gas from the brake booster via the first conduit, the electric valve, and the second conduit; and a control unit operatively associated with the electric pump and the electric valve, and configured to control operations of the electric pump and the electric valve according to a working state of the mechanical pump.
