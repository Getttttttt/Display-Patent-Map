abstract
    A vehicle control system examines characteristics of an upcoming segment of a trip of a hybrid vehicle. One or more locations in the upcoming segment of the trip are identified based on the characteristics as places where an engine of the vehicle is incapable of generating enough energy to power the vehicle through the locations. Operational settings of the vehicle are calculated based on the locations to operate the vehicle in a way that charges an energy storage device with energy that can be used to replace or supplement the energy provided by the engine to propel the hybrid vehicle over or through the locations. The one or more processors are configured to one or more of automatically control or generate a control signal for automated operation of the hybrid vehicle according to the one or more operational settings that are calculated.
