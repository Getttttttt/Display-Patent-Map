abstract
    A system increasing the efficiency of a powerplant by recovering the waste generated by an auxiliary cooling system is provided. The system may include a condensate loop and a heat recovery loop. These loops may integrate the auxiliary cooling systems of a gas turbine with the heat recovery steam generator of the powerplant. The integration may allow a smaller economizer section, which may increase the efficiency of the powerplant.
