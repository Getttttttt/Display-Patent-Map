abstract
    In a commercial vehicle with an internal combustion engine, a muffler in the exhaust gas system, and a heat recovery system, including a medium-containing circuit having at least one pump, an evaporator, an expander, and a condenser, the evaporator present in the medium-containing circuit of the heat recovery system is placed so that the evaporator is integrated into the muffler, where it either is installed in the tailpipe or partially replaces it, or is attached externally to the muffler, and an end section of the tailpipe, or is integrated into the tailpipe, which extends from the muffler and proceeds vertically upward behind the driver's cab, the evaporator being either installed in the tailpipe or partially replacing it, or is integrated into a muffler, which is installed in an exhaust pipe proceeding vertically upward behind the driver's cab.
