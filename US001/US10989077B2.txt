abstract
    A Waste-to-Energy plant comprising: an incineration chamber in which waste is combusted generating flue gas; an economizer heating feedwater using heat from the flue gas; an evaporator producing steam from the heated feedwater using heat from the flue gas; a steam drum receiving heated feedwater from the economizer and supplying heated feedwater, the steam drum receiving steam from the evaporator and supplying steam; and a superheater receiving and heating steam from the steam drum to a superheated steam using heat from the flue gas; the incineration chamber comprising a first PCM-wall and a second PCM-wall each comprising a plurality of pipes and a layer of PCM provided between the pipes and the incineration chamber, the pipes in the first PCM-wall receiving heated feedwater from the steam drum and producing additional steam therein and the pipes of the second PCM-wall additionally heating steam therein using radiant heat from the incineration chamber.
