abstract
    The present invention provides a double flow-circuit heat exchange device for periodic positive and reverse directional pumping, which is disposed with the bi-directional fluid pump capable of producing positive pressure or negative pressure at the fluid port on two sides of the bi-directional heat exchange device for periodically positive and reverse pumping the two fluid circuits in opposite flowing directions, thereby in the operation of periodically positive and reverse pumping to maintain the two fluid circuits in different flowing directions.
