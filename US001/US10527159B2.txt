abstract
    A hybrid vehicle control device has: a determining portion determining, during idle engine operation, whether a meshing state is achieved in which the lock member is meshed with the parking gear, or a non-meshing state is achieved in which the lock member is not meshed with the parking gear; and a control portion providing a control of applying the running electric motor torque to the rotary member to eliminate a gap in a meshing portion between gears in the power transmission system and a gap in a meshing portion between the parking gear and the lock member when it is determined that the meshing state is achieved, and providing a control of applying a torque of the differential electric motor to the rotary member to eliminate a gap in the meshing portion between gears in the power transmission system when it is determined that the non-meshing state is achieved.
