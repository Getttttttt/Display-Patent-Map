abstract
    A system of generating steam from an emulsion stream produced from a reservoir via thermal recovery has a heat exchanger for adjusting the emulsion to a first temperature; at least one separation device for separating water from the emulsion at the first temperature to obtain produced water; an optional produced-water preheater, and a high-pressure evaporator for receiving the produced water and generating steam using the produced water. The evaporator has a vapor drum; a heating element receiving the water stream, and in fluid communication with the vapor drum via a pressure letdown device; a heating source for imparting sensible heat to the water stream for generating steam. The evaporator also includes a recirculation pump for circulation of blowdown concentrate, and a bubble generator for generating bubbles and injecting generated bubbles into the heating element to enable self-removal of scales and other solid deposits in the evaporator.
