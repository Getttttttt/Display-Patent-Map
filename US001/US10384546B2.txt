abstract
    A braking system includes a drive system having a traction motor coupled in driving relationship to a wheel of a vehicle, a braking device configured to brake the vehicle, and a control unit. The motor is configured to provide both motive power for the vehicle in a propel mode of operation and retarding effort to brake the vehicle. The control unit is configured to determine a total retarding effort required to brake the vehicle in a braking mode of operation, and an amount of traction motor retarding effort available from the traction motor. The control unit is further configured to control the traction motor and the braking device so that at least one of the traction motor and the braking device brake the vehicle in the braking mode of operation.
