abstract
    A trailer can be configured to selectively provide powered wheels, energy recovery, and/or parasitic power source charging. A trailer-related trigger (drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, or a parasitic charging trigger) can be detected. When a drive activation trigger is detected, one or more motors can be activated to power one or more wheels of the trailer, thereby providing extra pushing power. When an energy recovery trigger is detected, one or more power sources of the trailer can be charged by recovering energy from the trailer. When a parasitic charging trigger is detected, one or more power sources of the trailer can be charged using a portion of the power generated by a main vehicle operatively connected to the trailer.
