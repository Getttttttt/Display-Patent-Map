abstract
    A device for supplying cold gases to an NMR installation or analytical apparatus equipped with a measuring probe, with cold gases ensuring the cooling of the sample contained in the probe, but also its lift and rotation, the device including an insulated tank containing liquid gas at boiling point and in which are arranged exchangers through which gas streams to be cooled pass, these exchangers being connected to transfer lines channeling the cooled gases to the probe. The device also includes at least one additional exchanger that ensures a pre-cooling of the gas stream before it is channeled to the corresponding exchanger, with the or each additional exchanger coming in the form of a double-flow exchanger that is supplied either by the gaseous vapor produced by the boiling of the liquid gas in the tank or by the cold gas that is evacuated or that escapes at the probe.
