abstract
    Systems and methods to achieve an electric supercharged co-power hybrid drive mechanism using a Rankine cycle system to reduce fossil fuel consumption are disclosed. The hybrid drive mechanism can be used by a vehicle or by stationary machine when fast changes of load are required. The drive mechanism comprises an internal combustion engine with an electric supercharger, an electric motor/generator and a Rankine cycle system using waste heat from the exhaust system and radiator of the combustion engine. The supercharger facilitates to further reducing the size of the combustion engine. The electrical supercharger is activated when higher power levels are required by the drive mechanism in order to push additional air into the internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine, the electric motor/generator and the turbine are all on a same drive shaft
