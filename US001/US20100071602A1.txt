abstract
    A processing facility can dispose of food waste in environmentally undisruptive manners. The processing facility can convert the food waste into bio-energy and bio-fuel products, such as bio-diesel, ethanol, and electricity. The processing facility can sort the food waste based on the fats or carbohydrates content of the food waste, and the processing facility can include a fluidized bed combustion module for combusting portions of the food waste.
