abstract
    A converter for an electrical machine having a plurality of phase lines for connecting the electrical machine. For each phase line the converter has a half-bridge with a first first semiconductor switch is configured to electrically connect at least one of the phase lines intermittently to a first supply line of the converter, and a second semiconductor switch configured to electrically connect the phase line intermittently to a second supply line of the converter. The converter is configured for operation in a first energy recovery limiting mode in which at least two of the first semiconductor switches are at least intermittently on simultaneously.
