abstract
    An oil boiler includes an outer container having openings at opposite ends, a combustion chamber that covers an opening at an upper end of the outer container and in which a combustion reaction occurs, a lower cover that covers an opening at a lower end of the outer container, a plurality of flue tubes to heat heating water flowing in the outer container by guiding combustion gas, a burner including a fuel nozzle that sprays fuel, an air nozzle that injects air, and a spark plug that ignites a mixture of the fuel and the air, and a flame tube part that defines a tube space by surrounding a partial space in which the mixture is ignited, the flame tube part including a flame tube having an open lower end and a recirculation hole formed through the flame tube such that the combustion gas is introduced into the flame tube.
