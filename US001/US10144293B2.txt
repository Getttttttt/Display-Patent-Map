abstract
    Provided is a driving force control device capable of stabilizing a vehicle behavior when a driving torque of a drive wheel is controlled. When slip suppression control is carried out to decrease a driving torque of a drive source that is connected to the drive wheel of a vehicle via a speed reduction mechanism and a drive shaft, and is configured to generate a torque for braking or driving the drive wheel, to thereby suppress a slip state of the drive wheel, the driving torque of the drive source is controlled so that a slip ratio of the drive wheel is in an area of the slip ratio smaller than a slip ratio corresponding to a peak value of a road surface friction coefficient in a characteristic of the road surface friction coefficient with respect to the slip ratio.
