abstract
    A vehicle and a method for controlling the vehicle are provided. The vehicle may include a battery; and a motor configured to generate a driving force by using the electric power charged in the battery, perform a regenerative braking, and charge the battery through the regenerative braking. The vehicle identifies destination information entered in the input during the preparation of charging at the charging station, searches for a route from the charging station to the destination based on the position information of the charging station and the position information of the destination, acquires the charging amount by regenerative braking based on the road information in the searched route and the table, and stops controlling the charging of the battery when the charging amount charged in the battery is charged by the regenerative braking during charging of the battery at the charging station.
