abstract
    A control apparatus of a vehicle includes, as a power plant, a motor and a transmission configured to transmit rotation of the motor to an output shaft. The control apparatus comprises: an acquisition unit configured to acquire information of a stop position at which the vehicle stops; a decision unit configured to decide a deceleration start position at which deceleration is started to stop at the stop position; and a control unit configured to switch, when performing deceleration control of the vehicle toward the stop position, deceleration control of the power plant between a manual driving mode and an automated driving mode.
