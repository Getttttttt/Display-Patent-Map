abstract
    A regenerative braking system for a vehicle, motorized or otherwise, that captures and stores the braking energy of the vehicle through the mechanical compression of a volume of pressurized gas contained in one or more onboard gas springs. This stored energy can be selectively released by the driver to assist with the acceleration of the vehicle from a stopped or moving condition. The compression of the volume of gas is accomplished by the insertion of a plunger into the cylinder of a gas spring by a mechanical spooling cable arrangement powered by the rotative braking of the vehicle. The release of the stored energy is accomplished by the withdrawal of the piston which acts through the spooling cable arrangement to transmit torque to the vehicle's drive train. The system can be implemented in various motorized or non-motorized vehicles.
