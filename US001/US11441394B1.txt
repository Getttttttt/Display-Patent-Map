abstract
    A system and method of generating electricity. A work string extends into a wellbore. A heat pump unit at a surface location circulates a working fluid through the work string to absorb heat from a formation surrounding the wellbore. A turbine generates a rotation from the working fluid that has absorbed the heat. A generator generates electricity from the rotation of the turbine. The electricity is transmitted to the surface location via an electrical cable.
