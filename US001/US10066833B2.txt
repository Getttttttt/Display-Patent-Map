abstract
    A burner system includes a plurality of burners, each having a nozzle positioned to emit a stream of fuel into a combustion volume, and a perforated flame holder, including a plurality of apertures extending between first and second faces thereof, and positioned to receive a stream of fuel from the respective nozzle. In operation, the flame holders are configured to hold a flame substantially within the plurality of apertures.
