abstract
    A vehicle including an electric motor has improved operating performance of a brake lamp using regenerative braking. A method of controlling a brake lamp of the vehicle includes determining a tendency of a driver, calculating a corrected mass based on the determined tendency of the driver, and calculating corrected acceleration based on the corrected mass and regenerative braking torque of the electric motor. An on threshold is corrected based on a difference between a requested torque and the regenerative braking torque at a time at which an accelerator pedal is released, and the brake lamp is turned on based on the corrected on threshold and the corrected acceleration.
