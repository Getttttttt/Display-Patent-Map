abstract
    A vehicle includes a motor-generator unit, an energy storage system, and a high-voltage load (such as an electric compressor and/or electric heater), all interconnected via a high-voltage bus. The motor-generator unit is configured to operate in a regenerative mode and a non-regenerative mode with respect to the high-voltage bus. A control module is configured to operate the load at a first power consumption level during the regenerative mode, and to operate the high-voltage load at a second power consumption level, less than the first power consumption level, during the non-regenerative mode.
