abstract
    A modification of a power boiler is disclosed, which comprises water walls enclosing the furnace for heating water and producing steam; a superheater system provided above the furnace for superheating steam; an additional superheater mounted in the furnace for further superheating steam from the superheater system. A modifying method of a power boiler is also disclosed, which comprises steps of mounting an additional superheater on water walls in a furnace; connecting an output of a superheater system to an inlet of the additional superheater; and connecting an outlet of the additional superheater to a turbine for producing power at an improved plant heat rate.
