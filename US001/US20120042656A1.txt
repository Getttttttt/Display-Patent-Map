abstract
    A closed-loop organic Rankine cycle apparatus to extract waste heat from the exhaust gas from a gas turbine engine is disclosed wherein the closed loop includes at least one additional heat exchanger. An additional heat exchanger for heating fuel may be in one of three locations relative to the ORC turbine and condensing heat exchanger. One location is a preferred location for adding heat to all fuels (liquid, gaseous and/or cryogenic). Another location is a practical location for adding heat to very cold or cryogenic fuels such as CNG or LNG. The closed-loop organic Rankine cycle apparatus, besides extracting waste heat from the exhaust gases, may also include an additional heat exchanger to recover heat from a compressor on a gas turbine engine prior to entering an intercooler on a gas turbine engine.
