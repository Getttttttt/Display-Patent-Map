abstract
    A thermoelectric generator unit, in particular for coupling to an exhaust gas pipe of an internal combustion engine, comprises at least one inner tube (16) having gas flowing therein and whose outer circumference comprises at least one flat portion (24). An oval outer housing (12) completely surrounds the inner tube (16) in circumferential direction. A plurality of thermoelectric modules (14) are arranged on the flat portions (24) of the inner tube (16). At least one cooling element (18) is provided which comprises a flat side on which the thermoelectric modules (14) are arranged. The assembly unit made up of inner tube (16), thermoelectric modules (14) and cooling element (18) is surrounded by an elastic compensation element (20) which rests on the inner side of the outer housing (12) and is retained in the outer housing (12) by means of clamping.
