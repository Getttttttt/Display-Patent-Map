abstract
    Methods and systems are provided related to a self-propelling work machine in the form of a tracked vehicle having an electric drive, with a generator drivable by an internal combustion engine, an auxiliary unit connected to the engine, and a braking apparatus for braking the work machine. The braking apparatus provides regenerative braking by the electric drive and comprises a feedback apparatus for feeding back electrical motor braking power of the electric motor to the generator to apply the motor braking power on the engine and on the auxiliary unit. A controller automatically increases or decreases the electrical load of the auxiliary unit based on the electrical motor braking power fed back to the engine and/or based on an engine speed.
