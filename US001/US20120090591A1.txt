abstract
    A condensate collector box includes a furnace mounting plate having a first edge portion, a second edge portion that extends from the first edge portion, at least one vent drain channel that extends along one of the first and second edge portions, and a heat exchanger condensate collection area. The condensate collector box also includes an inducer fan mounting member having a first surface and opposing second surface arranged upon the furnace mounting plate to form a condensate collection zone. The inducer fan mounting member includes at least one inducer fan drain passage that is fluidly connected to the at least one vent drain channel
