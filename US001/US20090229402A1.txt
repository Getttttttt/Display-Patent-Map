abstract
    A brake system for a hybrid vehicle includes a master cylinder, such as an active booster master cylinder, and a brake pedal mounted upon a pivoted brake pedal arm. A compliance device extends between the brake pedal arm and the master cylinder and includes a push rod and clevis assembly mating with the brake pedal arm. A composite drive pin including a resin sheath and a metallic core functions as part of the compliance device, by allowing limited motion between the brake pedal arm and brake pedal and the master cylinder push rod, so as to permit selective use of regenerative braking.
