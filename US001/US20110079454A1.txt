abstract
    A hybrid vehicle has an engine, and a transmission having a transmission input member operatively connected to the engine and a transmission output member. A transfer case is operatively connected to the transmission output member and has a first and a second transfer case torque distribution member, each operable to distribute torque from the transmission output member. The first transfer case torque distribution member is operatively connected with one of the front and rear pairs of wheels for providing driving torque from the transmission output member to the one of the front and rear pairs of wheels. A propeller shaft extends from and is operatively connected at one portion to the second transfer case distribution member. A motor/generator is operatively connected to another portion of the propeller shaft.
