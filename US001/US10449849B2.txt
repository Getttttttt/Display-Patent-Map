abstract
    A mobile mining machine includes a plurality of traction elements, a plurality of motors, a power source in electrical communication with the plurality of motors, and an energy storage system in electrical communication with the plurality of motors and the power source. Each of the motors is coupled to an associated one of the plurality of traction elements. Each of the motors is driven by the associated traction element in a first mode, and drives the associated traction element in a second mode. The energy storage system includes a shaft, a rotor secured to the shaft, a stator extending around the rotor, and a flywheel coupled to the shaft for rotation therewith. In the first mode, rotation of the motors causes rotation of the flywheel to store kinetic energy. In the second mode, rotation of the rotor and the flywheel discharges kinetic energy to drive the motors.
