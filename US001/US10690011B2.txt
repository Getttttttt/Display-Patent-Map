abstract
    There is provided a technique of a power generation system for performing power generation by introducing a cooling medium for cooling a plurality of semiconductor manufacturing apparatuses into a power generation part, wherein the system comprises a plurality of cooling medium passages, through which the cooling medium for cooling the semiconductor manufacturing apparatuses flows and connected to the power generation part. The system is configured to control an opening/closing part installed in each of the plurality of cooling medium passages based on a temperature of the cooling medium and to control inflow of the cooling medium from the plurality of cooling medium passages to the power generation part such that a temperature of the cooling medium flowing into the power generation part is equal to or higher than a predetermined temperature.
