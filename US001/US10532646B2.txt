abstract
    The present invention introduces a retrofit method of regenerative braking where no components of an automobile are to be replaced or removed and none of their functionality is modified. The recovering energy system is implemented as an additional, one piece, complete device, placed onto the existing automobile wheel's hub, and covered by the automobile's wheel. The system includes a housing, turbines, accumulators, and valves which act to both store and dispel energy as needed. This method of regenerative braking is therefore applicable to all the automobiles, independent or their power source, to newly built automobiles and those already on the road.
