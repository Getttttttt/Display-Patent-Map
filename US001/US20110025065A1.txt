abstract
    A clean steam electric engine utilizes a unique insulated chamber with a steel cylinder to store thermal energy. The apparatus includes: insulated chamber to prevent heat lost to the outside, steel cylinder to store thermal energy, natural gas burner, heating element, a turbine to convert the thermal energy into kinetic energy, condenser coil with air conditioning unit to convert the steam back to water, steel container to store water from the condenser, electric pump to the pump water back to the cylinder to be converted back to steam, and steel container to store natural gas.
