abstract
    A regenerative displacer for use in a stirling engine includes two opposite covers with respective through openings, a body engaging the covers to define an accommodation space therein, a regenerator disposed in the accommodation space, and a rod inserted through the regenerator and one of the covers into a cooling portion of the stirling engine. The regenerator has a plurality of channels. Each channel has two open ends and a heat collecting net engaging each open end. Working gas passing through the regenerative displacer can be concentrated at the open ends and can absorb and release heat quickly because of the heat collecting nets, thereby increasing the efficiency of heat exchange and a temperature difference of the working gas in a thermodynamic cycle. Accordingly, pressure is increased to facilitate a quick reciprocation of a power piston of the stirling engine, and this increases output power and saves energy.
