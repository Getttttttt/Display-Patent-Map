abstract
    When a vehicle travels, due to an input from a road surface to the front wheels and rear wheels of the vehicle, unsprung vertical accelerations are generated in unsprung portions of the vehicle. An electronic control unit detects such unsprung vertical accelerations. The electronic control unit calculates a front-back force generated at each of the wheels by use of the detected unsprung vertical acceleration, and estimates a front-back vibration generated in each of the wheels. The electronic control unit calculates a front-back vibration suppressing force for absorbing the front-back vibration by use of the detected unsprung vertical acceleration. The electronic control unit subtracts the calculated front-back vibration suppressing force from the calculated front-back force, and operates the in-wheel motors via an inverter, while controlling the output torques of the in-wheel motors. Thus, the front-back vibrations of the unsprung portions of the vehicle can be suppressed.
