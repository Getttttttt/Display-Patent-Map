abstract
    An exhaust gas routing device for an internal-combustion engine having a thermoelectric generator is fluidically connected with an exhaust gas line and a pipe guiding a coolant. The generator has a plurality of thermoelectric yoke pairs which are arranged between a first surface heated by the exhaust gas and a second surface cooled by the coolant. The exhaust gas routing device has a device guiding the exhaust gas along the first surface at a flow velocity that increases in the flow direction of the exhaust gas.
