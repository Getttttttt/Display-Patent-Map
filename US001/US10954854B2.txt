abstract
    A hybrid power plant system including a gas turbine system and a coal fired boiler system inputs high oxygen content gas turbine flue gas into the coal fired boiler system, said gas turbine flue gas also including carbon dioxide that is desired to be captured rather than released to the atmosphere. Oxygen in the gas turbine flue gas is consumed in the coal fired boiler, resulting in relatively low oxygen content boiler flue gas stream to be processed. Carbon dioxide, originally included in the gas turbine flue gas, is subsequently captured by the post combustion capture apparatus of the coal fired boiler system, along with carbon diode generated by the burning of coal. The supply of gas turbine flue gas which is input into the boiler system is controlled using dampers and/or fans by a controller based on an oxygen sensor measurement and one or more flow rate measurements.
