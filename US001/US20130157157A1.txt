abstract
    A method for operating a fuel cell system includes electrically coupling a fuel cell stack to an energy storage device and an electrical demand by a load device. A controller is coupled to the fuel cell stack, the energy storage device, and the load device via a communications connection. The controller obtains information relative to an operation of at least one of the fuel cell stack and the energy storage device and the controller controls an operation of the load device based on the information.
