abstract
    The present invention relates to a hybrid variant automobile drive which improves a fuel efficiency of the automobile while retaining an acceleration profile of the automobile. In one embodiment, the present invention includes an engine, wheels, and/or a supplemental motor. The engine primarily drives the wheels, but can be aided by the supplemental motor. An amount of force supplied by the engine can be dependent on an amount of force supplied by the supplemental motor. The supplemental motor uses alternative energy sources aside from the fuel used by the engine to drive the wheels. The supplemental motor can be powered by a capacitor which is charged by an energy generation unit. The energy generation unit can generate energy using, for example, solar panels, a ram induction generator, a regenerative braking unit, and/or a heat exchange unit.
