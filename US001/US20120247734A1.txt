abstract
    A design and manufacturing technique for a “Long Heat Exchanger”, a counter-flow heat exchanger sizeable to transfer up to 100% of heat and temperature between two fluids (gas or liquid). Inner “Core” capable of manufacture in continuous lengths, may be coiled, cut and formed to shape multiple applications, ranging from engine exhaust, to recycling steam turbine, to building furnaces. Core costs are comparable to metal tubing costs, and outer or “Main” channel housing may be existing exhaust channels being retrofitted or new housing injection molded in sections.
