abstract
    Disclosed is a fin tube for thermal energy transfer of turbomachine exhaust including a tube disposable in an exhaust stream of a turbomachine and a plurality of fins extending from an outer surface of the tube. Each fin includes a plurality of adjacent fin segments which are separated by a serration. At least one fin segment of the plurality of fin segments includes at least one dimple thereon. The at least one dimple increases a turbulence of exhaust flow across the at least one fin segment and increases a surface area of the at least one fin segment thereby increasing a thermal energy transfer capability of the fin tube. Further disclosed is a combined cycle power plant utilizing the fin tube and a method for operating the combined cycle power plant.
