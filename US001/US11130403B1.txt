abstract
    A vehicle comprising, an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, an electric machine, and a controller. The electric machine is configured to propel the vehicle and to brake the vehicle via regenerative braking. The controller is programmed to, in response to releasing the accelerator pedal, increase a regenerative braking torque of the electric machine to a first value. The controller is further programmed to, in response to depressing the brake pedal, increase the regenerative braking torque of the electric machine from the first value to a second value. The controller is further programmed to, in response to a speed of the vehicle decreasing to less than a first threshold, decrease the regenerative braking torque of the electric machine from the second value to the first value.
