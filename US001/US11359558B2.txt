abstract
    A method and a turbine-compressor assembly of a system having an engine includes an upstream valve coupled with a compressor and a turbine-compressor device, a downstream valve coupled with a turbine and the device, and a controller to control the upstream, downstream, and a control valve. The controller selectively operates the device in a plurality of operating modes. In a turbine mode of operation, the upstream valve directs inlet air to the compressor, the turbine receives engine exhaust, the downstream valve directs first turbine exhaust from the turbine to the device, and the control valve directs second turbine exhaust from the device to an outlet. In a compressor mode of operation, the control valve directs the inlet air to the device, the upstream valve directs first compressed air from the device to the compressor, and the downstream valve directs the first turbine exhaust from the turbine to the outlet.
