abstract
    A regenerative braking control system of an AWD (all-wheel-drive) hybrid vehicle including a front wheel HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) powertrain and a rear wheel EV (electric vehicle) powertrain is provided. The control system includes a manipulating instrument mounted to a steering wheel for manual shifting and regenerative braking control by a driver's manipulation, and a controller for adjusting a regenerative braking amount and controlling a shift pattern of each of a front wheel motor of the front wheel HEV powertrain and a rear wheel motor of the rear wheel EV powertrain by receiving a (−) or (+) manipulation signal or a hold manipulation signal of the manipulating instrument.
