abstract
    A method for controlling a regenerative brake system for a vehicle may include: generating a target pressure of each wheel of the vehicle, when any one performance condition of ABS-associated control, VDC-associated control, and TCS-associated control is satisfied; determining whether to enter the ABS-associated control; opening an entrance-side wheel of a target wheel such that a raised/lowered pressure for the target wheel is formed, when determining to perform the VDC-associated control or TCS-associated control; and performing pressure raising/lowering control for the target wheel by controlling a motor such that a wheel pressure of the target wheel follows the target pressure of the target wheel.
