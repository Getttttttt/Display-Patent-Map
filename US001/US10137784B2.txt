abstract
    Provided is a control device for an electric vehicle capable of stabilizing vehicle behavior when performing slip control of drive wheels. The control device for an electric vehicle according to the present invention is a control device for an electric vehicle to be used in an electric vehicle, the electric vehicle including: a motor which is connected to the drive wheels of the electric vehicle via a differential gear and a drive shaft, and which is configured to generate a braking or driving torque for each of the drive wheels; and a mechanical braking device capable of independently generating a braking force for each of the drive wheels. In this control device for an electric vehicle, when a slip ratio of each of the drive wheels is detected as being a predetermined slip ratio or more, a torque absolute value of the motor is reduced so that the slip ratio of each of the drive wheels is a target motor slip ratio, and a larger braking force is applied by the mechanical braking device to, of a right drive wheel and a left drive wheel, the drive wheel having a higher wheel speed than the drive wheel having a lower wheel speed.
