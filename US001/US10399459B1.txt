abstract
    An energy recovery system for a machine, and particularly a multi-wheeled vehicle, includes an energy generation component housed within one or more of said wheel assemblies, coupled to an energy storage component which selectively receives energy from said vehicle motion effect on said energy generation component(s) and delivers said energy to a said energy storage component. In one embodiment, said energy generation is an electric generator, and said storage component is an electric battery.
