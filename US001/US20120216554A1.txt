abstract
    An intelligent energy-saving air conditioner includes a control device (1), a heat-exchange circulation system (2), a refrigerating system (3), and an inner air blower (41) and outer air blower (42) both are shared by the heat-exchange circulation system (2) and the refrigerating system (3). The control device (1) includes a temperature collecting and comparing unit and a control unit. The heat-exchange circulation system (2) includes a first heat exchanger (21) and a second heat exchanger (22) separately arranged from each other, and heat-exchange circulation pipes (24) connecting the first and second heat exchangers (21), (22). The refrigerating system (3) includes an evaporator (31), a condenser (32), a compressor (33) and refrigerating circulation pipes (34) connecting the evaporator (31), the condenser (32) and the compressor (33). The first heat exchanger (21) and the evaporator (31) are arranged close to each other and share the inner air blower (41), and the second heat exchanger (22) and the condenser (32) are arranged close to each other and share the outer air blower (42).
