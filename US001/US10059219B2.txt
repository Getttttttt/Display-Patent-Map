abstract
    An exemplary electric vehicle includes a data storage module to hold a range of past energy consumption rates for an electric vehicle, and a controller to calculate a predicted energy consumption for the electric vehicle based on variations in the past energy consumption rates across the range. An exemplary vehicle assembly includes a data storage module to hold a range of past energy consumption rates for an electric vehicle, and a controller configured to calculate a predicted energy consumption for the electric vehicle based on variations in the range. An operation of the electric vehicle is configured to alter in response to the predicted energy consumption.
