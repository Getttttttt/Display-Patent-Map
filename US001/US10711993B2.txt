abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery device includes: a main passage through which an exhaust gas containing a corrosive component flows; a boiler which heats a heat medium using the exhaust gas; a bypass passage connected to the main passage so as to detour around the boiler; a regulation valve member which regulates a flow rate of the exhaust gas flowing into the boiler; a heat medium circuit which circulates the heat medium that is heated to be in a hot-water state by the boiler; a binary electricity generation device which recovers thermal energy from the heat medium in the heat medium circuit and generates electricity; and a valve control unit which controls an opening of the regulation valve member such that a temperature of the exhaust gas passed through the boiler is equal to or higher than a temperature of an acid dew-point of the corrosive component in the exhaust gas.
