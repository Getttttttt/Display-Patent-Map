abstract
    The present invention relates to an energy storage module system and, more specifically, to a hybrid energy storage module system selectively using, according to the amount of power required in a load, a lithium battery and a lead storage battery by mutually supplementing the lithium battery and the lead storage battery. According to the present invention, the hybrid energy storage module system is an energy storage module system for supplying power necessary for the driving of a load and comprises an energy storage device, a first sensing unit and a second sensing unit, and a controller. The energy storage device includes at least one lithium battery module and at least one lead storage battery module. In addition, the energy storage device includes a switching network configured so as to connect the lithium battery module and the lead storage battery module in different arrangement modes. The energy storage device is connected to both ends of a load and supplies power. The switching network can include a path for connecting the lithium battery module and the lead storage battery module, and a plurality of switches provided on the path. The first sensing unit is configured so as to measure the temperature and the voltage of the lithium battery modules, and the second sensing unit is configured so as to measure the temperature and the voltage of the lead storage battery module. The controller controls the switching network in order to change the arrangement modes of the lithium battery module and the lead storage battery module of the energy storage device.
