abstract
    A vehicle thermal management system (VTMS) includes: an Integrated Thermal Management Valve (ITM) for receiving coolant through a coolant inlet connected to an engine coolant outlet of an engine, and for distributing the coolant flowing out toward a radiator through a coolant outlet flow path connected to a heat exchange system. The heat exchanger system includes at least one among a heater core, an oil warmer, and an Auto Transmission Fluid (ATF) warmer and the radiator. The VTMS also includes: a water pump positioned at the front end of an engine coolant inlet of the engine; a coolant branch flow path branched from the front end of the engine coolant inlet to be connected to an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler together with the coolant outlet flow path; and a Smart Single Valve (SSV) for adjusting a coolant flow in a coolant outlet flow path direction and an EGR cooler flow path direction on the coolant branch flow path.
