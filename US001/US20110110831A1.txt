abstract
    A crystallizer system for forming solid crystals includes a vessel defining a cylindrical sidewall, a sparge device located at a bottom of the vessel, a plurality of impellers attached to a shaft, and a plurality of redistribution funnel assemblies vertically spaced apart. Each funnel assembly may be positioned underneath a respective impeller of the plurality of impellers. Each funnel assembly may include a funnel, a disc attached to the shaft such that the disc rotates with the impellers, and a channel extending radially inward from a location near the sidewall. The channel may be adapted to direct gas bubbles from the sidewall to a location near blade outer edges of the respective impeller A lower edge of the funnel and the disc may define a lower gap therebetween, such that solid particles falling from within the funnel are directed out of the lower gap when the disc is rotated.
