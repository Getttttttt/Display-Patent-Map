abstract
    The present invention overcomes several disadvantages inherent in the operation of heat generating systems, particularly in the operation of engine-generators sets. The present apparatuses and methods increase the efficiency of these systems and provide means to economize fuel in their operation. The present invention applies to many type of engines and engines set combinations, but particularly to engine generator sets that run on fuels. Heat generating systems such as an engine-generator set are immersed in a medium similar, but not necessarily equal to, one used on oil cooled or liquid filled electrical transformers with high thermal conductivity and a high voltage rating. The medium in the unit recovers wasted heat (thermal energy). The heat recovered is transferred with a heat transfer unit or heat exchanger and utilized directly, as useful energy, for many purposes, such as heating, or cooling with the use of absorption or adsorption chillers.
