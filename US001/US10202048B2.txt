abstract
    System, methods, and other embodiments described herein relate to preemptively controlling one or more vehicle systems of a vehicle. In one embodiment, a method includes, in response to (i) detecting that a present traffic level along a route of the vehicle satisfies a congestion threshold and (ii) detecting that a type of roadway on which the vehicle is traveling is a highway, determining whether the vehicle is traveling in a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane by identifying whether a number of passengers in the vehicle satisfies an HOV threshold. The method includes adjusting the one or more vehicle systems within the vehicle according to whether the number of passengers satisfies the HOV threshold to cause the vehicle to operate efficiently while traveling along the route with the present traffic level.
