abstract
    An electric automobile includes an electric motor coupled to a first axle that propels the automobile in a desired direction. An alternator or generator is coupled to the second axle and includes an output that powers the electric motor or recharges a power source that powers the electric motor. A gearbox is arranged to harness the reciprocating motion of one of the axles and provide angular motion to the shaft of the generator or alternator.
