abstract
    A vehicle includes an axle, electric machine, friction, brakes, and a controller. The axle has an input shaft to an open differential and output shaft extending out of the open differential. The electric machine is secured to the input shaft and wheels are secured to the output shafts. The controller is programmed to, in response to an anti-locking braking event, generate a signal indicative of a total torque demand to brake the vehicle based on a difference between a desired and an actual wheel slip ratio, adjust a regenerative braking torque of the electric machine based on signal and a regenerative braking weighting coefficient to maintain or drive actual wheel slip toward the desired wheel slip, and adjust a friction braking torque of the friction brakes based on the signal and a friction braking weighting coefficient to drive actual wheel slip at or toward the desired wheel slip.
