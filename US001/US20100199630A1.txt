abstract
    A compact, combined cycle gas and steam turbine engine for lower temperature,lower RPM's, and higher torque than a standard gas turbine, while maintaining the lower turbine weight ratio over internal combustion engines. This turbine has a cylindrical combustion chamber, containing a tube boiler spiraled around the inside, in a manner to create a vortex type combustion gas flow, which drives the primary turbine blades. The steam created in this boiler tube jetted against the secondary turbine blades adds torque. The hot combustion gasses are compressed, and passed into the steam stream to reheat and reexpand the steam, which also lowers the exhaust temperature. Unlike most turbine cylinders which turn the inside cylinder this is the only one which turns the outward cintrifical pressured cylinder, which means greater efficiency. The circular exhaust has air induction to increase power and help cool a normally hot exhaust. Water vapor and cooled exhaust from the manifold is ducted between the combustion chamber and outter wall for intercooling the engine and increasing output of the fuel. Existing electronic controls may easily be added.
