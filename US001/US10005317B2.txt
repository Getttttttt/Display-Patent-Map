abstract
    A method of thermal management for an electrically motorized wheel, the method can include defining a thermally conductive path from at least one component, the at least one component becoming heated during operation of the electrically motorized wheel, providing the path with a thermally conductive material and further defining the path such that the path contacts the at least one component, further defining the path such that the path contacts a hub shell assembly of the electrically motorized wheel thereby conducting heat from the at least one component to the hub shell assembly.
