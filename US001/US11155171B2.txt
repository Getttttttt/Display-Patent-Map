abstract
    In an aspect of the disclosure, a method, a computer-readable medium, and an apparatus are provided. The apparatus may be a vehicle power system, which includes an electric motor, a primary power source that energizes the electric motor, wherein the primary power source employs a turbine to generate electricity, a second power source that supplements the primary power source to energize the electric motor, and a control component that monitors power provided to the electric motor by the primary power source, that determines that additional power needs to be provided to the electric motor in order to meet a driving requirement, and that directs additional power from the second power source to the electric motor.
