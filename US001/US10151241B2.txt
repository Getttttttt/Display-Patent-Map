abstract
    The regenerative gas turbine combustor is such that a compressed air passage between a combustor inner cylinder 10 and a tail cylinder 12, and a combustor outer cylinder 7 is blocked by a division wall 15 at a position between a bleeding port 13 and an injection port 14, and compressed air is preheated in a regenerator 4 and then the compressed air thus preheated is burnt together with fuel. This combustor includes seal rings 17a-17c, a holder 16 installed on the inner circumferential portion of the division wall 15 and having ring grooves 25a-25c for holding the respective seal rings 17a-17c, and gaps 20 provided between the inner circumferential surfaces of the ring grooves 25a-25c and the outer circumferential surfaces of the seal rings 17a-17c.
