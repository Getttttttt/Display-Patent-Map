abstract
    A system and method for efficient (e.g., economical) computing in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles is disclosed. A compute manager is configured to receive and schedule compute tasks for execution on computing cores in the vehicle to increase the usage of recaptured energy that would otherwise be wasted due to battery limitations. Vehicle status information such as current battery charge level and current route may be used to determine whether compute tasks can be beneficially executed.
