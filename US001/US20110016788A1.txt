abstract
    A tube and shell heat exchanger for a gasification system is provided. The heat exchanger includes a first shell-side inlet positioned proximate to a heat exchanger tube-side inlet. The first shell-side inlet is configured to receive a first portion of a scrubbed syngas flow therethrough. This first scrubbed syngas portion facilitates substantially preventing fouling at the heat exchanger inlet. The heat exchanger also includes a second shell-side inlet positioned proximate to a heat exchanger tube-side outlet. The second shell-side inlet is configured to receive a second portion of a scrubbed syngas flow therethrough.
