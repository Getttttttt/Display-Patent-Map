abstract
    An automotive battery module having dual voltage is disclosed, including a housing and a plurality of battery cells connected to form battery cell blocks disposed in the housing. A battery control unit is provided disposed in the housing and is configured to control operation of a battery system. The battery system includes at least one switching device operably connected to a first battery cell block in a first connection arrangement. The first battery cell block is configured to deliver a first voltage. The switching device is also operably connected to a second battery cell block in a second connection arrangement. The second battery cell block is configured to deliver a second voltage. A plurality of terminals are provided on the housing and electrically coupled to the battery control unit and plurality of battery cells, providing an external electrical connection to deliver the first voltage and the second voltage.
