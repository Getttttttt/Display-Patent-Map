abstract
    A regenerative braking control apparatus equipped on an electrically driven vehicle having road wheels and an electric motor for driving the road wheels for running. An operation unit is provided for the driver of the vehicle to select a magnitude of the braking force to be generated by the electric motor during regenerative braking. A determination unit determines, on the basis of conditions of the electrically driven vehicle, whether or not a selected braking force selected through the operation unit is acceptable. A notifier unit is constructed such that, in a case where the selected braking force is determined to be unacceptable by the determination unit, the notifier unit provides a corresponding notification to the driver.
