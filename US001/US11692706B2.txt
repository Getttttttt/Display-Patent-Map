abstract
    The invention provides a thermal cracking system which comprises a reactor, and a feed module or a solid product discharge module. The feed module transports a feed material from the outside environment to the reactor. While being transported, the feed material is heated by the feed module to become molten and fills up the interior of the feed module, thereby preventing air from entering the reactor. The solid product discharge module transports a solid product from the reactor to the outside environment. One end of the solid product discharge module is connected with the reactor. The other end of the solid product discharge module comprises a first opening interfacing with the outside environment. When the solid product is transported to the outside environment, the opening size of the first opening is selected such that the speed at which the solid product is entering the solid product discharge module form the reactor is equal to or greater than that at which the solid product is leaving the solid product discharge module, through the first opening, and into the outside environment. Benefit of the invention includes a higher production efficiency and enhanced safety for a thermal cracking system at industrial scale.
