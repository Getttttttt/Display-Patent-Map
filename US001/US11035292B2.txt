abstract
    A power generation system includes an inert gas power source, a thermal/electrical power converter and a power plant. The thermal/electrical power converter includes a compressor with an output coupled to an input of the inert gas power source. The power plant has an input coupled in series with an output of the thermal/electrical power converter. The thermal/electrical power converter and the power plant are configured to serially convert thermal power produced at an output of the inert gas power source into electricity. The thermal/electrical power converter includes an inert gas reservoir tank coupled to an input of the compressor via a reservoir tank control valve and to the output of the compressor via another reservoir tank control valve. The reservoir tank control valve and the another reservoir tank control valve are configured to regulate a temperature of the output of the thermal/electrical power converter.
