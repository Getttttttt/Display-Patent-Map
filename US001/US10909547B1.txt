abstract
    This invention provides a system or method that includes combustion of mixed content solid waste to produce flue gases and separation of carbon dioxide gas in the produced combustion flue gas from other gaseous constituents of the flue gas in an amount produced from the burning of plastic material contained in the mixed content solid waste. The separated carbon dioxide is sequestered in geologic formations, thereby providing environmentally sound disposal and elimination of plastic waste, in one consolidated process, free of the need for separation of plastic waste from other solid or the need to identify and separate the various forms and compositions of plastic waste material. The illustrative disposal of plastic waste hereby is generally free of emission into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide gas. The invention includes a fee-generation process applied to customers, which can quantified and generated in association with the application of the system or method.
