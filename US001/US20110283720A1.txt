abstract
    A system and method for transferring heat from a process source and dissipating it to the ambient atmosphere. The system uses a low-volatility, hygroscopic working fluid to reject thermal energy directly to ambient air. Direct-contact heat exchange allows for the creation of large interfacial surface areas for effective heat transfer. Heat transfer is further enhanced by water vapor pressure gradients present between the equilibrium moisture content of the working fluid and the ambient air. Cyclic absorption and evaporation of atmospheric moisture dampens variations in cooling capacity because of ambient temperature changes. The low-volatility and hygroscopic nature of the working fluid prevents complete evaporation of the fluid and a net consumption of water.
