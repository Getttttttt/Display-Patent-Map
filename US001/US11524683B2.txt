abstract
    Industrial vehicles that include a speed sensor configured to generate a speed sensor signal, a payload sensor configured to generate a payload sensor signal, an inclination sensor configured to generate an inclination sensor signal, a wheel motor connected to a wheel of the industrial vehicle, and a controller. The wheel motor includes an electric retarder device for applying a retardation force to the wheel. The controller is configured to receive the speed sensor signal, receive the payload sensor signal, receive the inclination sensor signal, determine a required retardation force for the industrial vehicle based on the payload sensor signal and the inclination sensor signal, determine an available retardation force for the industrial vehicle based on the speed sensor signal, and generate an output indicating the required retardation force for the industrial vehicle relative to the available retardation force for the industrial vehicle.
