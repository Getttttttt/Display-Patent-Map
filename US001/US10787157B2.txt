abstract
    A vehicle brake system including a hydraulic brake device that includes: a brake actuator including a pump and a two-system electric motor that includes first and second coils; a battery; a first drive circuit for supplying electric power from the battery to the first coil; a capacitor; and a second drive circuit for supplying electric power from the capacitor to the second coil, wherein, in a normal mode in which the pump is driven by power not greater than set power, the motor drives the pump by the electric power supplied from the battery to the first coil, and wherein, in a high power mode in which the pump is driven by power that exceeds the set power, the motor drives the pump by both of the electric power supplied from the battery to the first coil and the electric power supplied from the capacitor to the second coil.
