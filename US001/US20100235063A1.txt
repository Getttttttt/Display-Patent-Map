abstract
    A hybrid vehicle (1) includes a rotation speed sensor (7) for detecting speed of rotation (Nm) of a motor generator (MG2). Fluctuation of the rotation speed (Nm) of the motor generator (MG2) reflects fluctuation of a first torque generated in a power transmitting member including a drive shaft (8). Hybrid vehicle (1) further includes a controller (30) for controlling a second torque transmitted from motor generator (MG2) through a rotation shaft of motor generator (MG2) to the power transmitting member, based on the speed of rotation (Nm) detected by rotation speed sensor (7). If the first torque is a vibration torque that fluctuates to cause the rotation shaft of motor generator (MG2) to rotate in positive and negative directions, controller (30) controls the second torque such that difference between absolute values of maximum value and minimum value of the vibration torque becomes smaller.
