abstract
    A vehicle battery heating apparatus is to be mounted in a vehicle that travels with electricity from a battery. The apparatus includes a battery, a heater, a sensor, a controller, and a memory. The battery is mountable in the vehicle to allow the vehicle to travel. The heater heats the battery. The sensor obtains a temperature of the battery. The controller heats the battery with the heater. The memory stores heating target temperatures for respective remaining capacities of the battery. The controller obtains a remaining capacity of the battery, obtains a target temperature from the memory in accordance with the obtained remaining capacity, and sets a target temperature for heating the battery which is not on charge while the vehicle is stopped to the obtained target temperature. The heater heats the battery to the set target temperature.
