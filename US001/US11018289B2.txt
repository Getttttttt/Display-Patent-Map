abstract
    Disclosed is a thermoelectric generation system that generates electricity using waste heat from a steam condenser that exchanges heat with steam as cyclic water flows through a high temperature portion and a low temperature portion, the thermoelectric generation system including: a first hot-water discharge line used to discharge the cyclic water passing through the high temperature portion; a cyclic water circulation line through which the cyclic water from under water circulates; and a thermoelectric generation unit that generates electricity on the basis of a temperature difference between a temperature of the cyclic water flowing through the first hot-water discharge line and a temperature of the cyclic water flowing through the cyclic water circulation line.
