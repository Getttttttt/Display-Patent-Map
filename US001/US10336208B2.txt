abstract
    Systems and methods are provided for regulating the state of charge of a battery. An exemplary electrical system includes a fuel cell coupled to a bus and a battery coupled to the bus via a switching arrangement coupled to a capacitor. An exemplary method for operating the electrical system involves operating the switching arrangement such that a voltage of the battery is substantially equal to a voltage of the fuel cell when a state of charge of the battery is greater than a lower threshold value and less than an upper threshold value, and operating the switching arrangement to couple the capacitor electrically in series between the battery and the bus when the state of charge of the battery is not between the lower threshold value and the upper threshold value.
