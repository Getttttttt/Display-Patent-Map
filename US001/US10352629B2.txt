abstract
    The present invention relates to a heat exchange element in which unit constituent members, each of which includes a partition member that has a heat-transfer property and a moisture permeability and a spacing member that holds the partition member with a predetermined spacing, are stacked and in which a primary air flow that passes along an upper surface side of the partition member and a secondary air flow that passes along an undersurface side of the partition member and crosses the primary air flow exchange heat and moisture through the partition member, wherein a detachment suppressing rib is provided on the opposite side of the spacing member when viewed from the partition member at a bonded portion between the partition member and the spacing member, and the partition member is sandwiched by the spacing member and the detachment suppressing rib.
