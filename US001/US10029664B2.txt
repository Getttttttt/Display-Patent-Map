abstract
    A control system for a vehicle includes an electric drive system associated with a first set of wheels (e.g., rear wheels) of a vehicle and a drive system control unit configured to control the electric drive system to selectively provide electric motive power to the first set of wheels to propel the vehicle and electric retarding to slow the vehicle. The system further includes a friction brake system having a first friction brake unit associated with the first set of wheels and a second friction brake unit associated with a second set of wheels (e.g., front wheels) of the vehicle. The drive system control unit is further configured, in at least one mode of operation, to independently control the first and second friction brake units to concurrently apply different levels of friction braking to the first and second sets of wheels, to reduce wear unevenness.
