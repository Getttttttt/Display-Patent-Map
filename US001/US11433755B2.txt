abstract
    A drive device includes a fluid coupling and a rotary electrical machine. The fluid coupling is configured such that a torque is inputted thereto from a first side in an axial direction and is outputted therefrom to a second side in the axial direction. The rotary electrical machine includes a first stator and a rotor. The first stator is disposed in a non-rotatable manner. The rotor is disposed to be rotated about a rotational axis of the fluid coupling. The rotary electrical machine is disposed on the second side with respect to the fluid coupling in the axial direction. The rotary electrical machine overlaps the fluid coupling in an axial view.
