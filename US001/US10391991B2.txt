abstract
    An electric automobile braking device includes a master cylinder that has no vacuum booster and a hydraulic booster device that can increase a brake fluid pressure generated by the master cylinder. Switching is possible between a normal braking mode in which hydraulic braking and regenerative braking are used in combination when a percentage charge of a battery is less than a threshold value and a regenerative braking restriction mode in which hydraulic braking is permitted and regenerative braking is restricted when the percentage charge is a threshold value or greater. In the regenerative braking restriction mode, when a depressing force of a brake pedal by a driver exceeds a first depressing force over a predetermined period of time, an operation of the hydraulic booster device is suppressed.
