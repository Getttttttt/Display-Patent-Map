abstract
    Disclosed are an air supply device and an air supply method for a hybrid power generation facility in which a gas turbine compresses air introduced from an outside, mixes the compressed air with fuel, and burns a mixture of the compressed air and the fuel to produce combustion gas. The air supply device includes a mixing chamber configured to selectively receive the combustion gas from the gas turbine, an air preheater configured to supply air to the mixing chamber, a burner configured to burn a fluid supplied from the mixing chamber, a first over-firing air supplier configured to receive a fluid from the gas turbine or the air preheater, a first pipeline connecting the gas turbine and the mixing chamber, and a second pipeline connecting the gas turbine and the first over-firing air supplier.
