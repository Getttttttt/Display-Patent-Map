abstract
    A method for controlling regenerative braking of a vehicle is provided, in which a driving area of a motor is decided when shifting gears during regenerative braking, and an amount of regenerative braking is determined based on the decided result. The method includes a first process of deciding whether motor torque is in a constant power mode, a second process of deciding whether the motor torque is in a constant torque mode, and a third process of deciding whether the mode of the motor torque is converted into the constant torque mode from the constant power mode.
