abstract
    According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a method, system and technique for energy allocation is disclosed. The system includes: a filtration system configured to filter waste vegetable oil generated by a facility; an engine fueled with the filtered vegetable oil; and a generator driven by the engine to provide an alternating current (AC) power supply; and wherein exhaust heat generated by the engine is processed and allocated to the facility as an energy source.
