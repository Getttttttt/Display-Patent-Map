abstract
    A regenerative braking control apparatus of a vehicle may include: a drive motor; a battery for providing driving voltage to the drive motor; a data detector for detecting a driving state information of the vehicle; and a vehicle controller generating a total braking amount based on the driving state information. In particular, the vehicle controller generates a regenerative braking possible amount by using a generatable power of the drive motor and a chargeable power of the battery, performs a regenerative braking when the regenerative braking possible amount is greater than the total braking amount, and also prepares a hydraulic pressure braking based on the regenerative braking possible amount and a regenerative braking amount based on the regenerative braking.
