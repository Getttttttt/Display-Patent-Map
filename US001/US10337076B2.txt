abstract
    A method for reducing metal oxide containing charge materials (1): reducing the metal oxide containing charge materials (1) in at least two fluidized bed units (RA,RE) by means of a reduction gas (2), wherein at least some of the resulting off-gas (3) is recycled and wherein the metal oxide containing charge materials (1) are conveyed into the fluidized bed unit RE by a propellant gas. Also, apparatus for carrying out the method according to the invention is disclosed.
