abstract
    A vehicular heat management device includes a first heat source, a second heat source, a first heat generator, a second heat generator, a heat generator pathway, a first heat source pathway, a second heat source pathway, and a switching portion. The first heat source and the second heat source heat a heat medium. The first heat generator generates heat according to operation. The second heat generator generates heat according to operation. The first heat generator and the second heat generator are provided in the heat generator pathway. The first heat generator is provided in the first heat generator pathway. The second heat generator is provided in the second heat generator pathway. The switching portion switches between a condition where the heat generator pathway is in flowing communication with the first heat generator pathway and a condition where the heat generator pathway is in flowing communication with the second heat generator pathway.
