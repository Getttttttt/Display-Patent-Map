abstract
    A system for power integration is provided. The system for power integration includes a planetary gear system with a ring gear, a sun gear and a carrier. A supercharger compressor is mechanically coupled to the ring gear, a secondary turbine is mechanically coupled to the sun gear, and a hybrid energy device is mechanically coupled to the carrier. The system is configured for an internal combustion engine (ICE) to be mechanically coupled to the hybrid energy device through the carrier and a first clutch, and a brake may be mechanically coupled to the supercharger compressor via a band brake or second clutch. The system integrates power between the supercharger compressor, secondary turbine, hybrid energy device and ICE such that enhanced fuel economy is provided.
