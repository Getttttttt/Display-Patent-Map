abstract
    A power generation control system of an electric vehicle is disclosed. The power generation control system of an electric vehicle is characterized in that an elastic recovery force of a spring is converted into a rotational energy via a spring power generation apparatus, and the converted rotational energy is accelerated for thereby driving a vehicle generator and generating electric power, and when the spring is over loosened, the auto winding operation of a spring is performed by means of a spring winding motor with the help of a control of the control unit, and when the battery is over charged by means of the power generation process, the operation of the spring power generation apparatus is stopped.
