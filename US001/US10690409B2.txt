abstract
    A method for drying bulk goods, in particular wood fibers and/or wood chips, wherein the bulk goods is continuously dried in a dryer (1), in particular a drum dryer. The vapor-gas mixture flows through the drum dryer (1) in a dryer circuit and is indirectly heated via at least one heat exchanger (4) by a burner waste gas that is heated in at least one burner (5). The drying vapors are supplied to the at least one heat exchanger (4). Upstream, downstream and/or within the at least one heat exchanger (4), at least a partial flow of the drying vapors are branched off to be conducted into the burner (5). The remaining partial flow is conducted to the dryer (1) again. The partial flow of drying vapors to the burner (5) is driven by at least one regulable partial vapor fan (10).
