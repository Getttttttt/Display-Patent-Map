abstract
    An energy recovery ventilator includes first and second blowers, a pressure transducer and a controller. The first blower is configured to direct a first air stream into a first zone of an enclosure. A second blower configured to direct a second air stream into a second zone of the enclosure. A pressure transducer is configured to determine internal air pressure within the enclosure. A controller is configured to control the first blower and/or the second blower in response to the internal air pressure.
