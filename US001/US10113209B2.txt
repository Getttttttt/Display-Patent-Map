abstract
    A method for producing high carbon content metallic iron using coke oven gas, including: dividing a top gas stream from a direct reduction shaft furnace into a first top gas stream and a second top gas stream; mixing the first top gas stream with a coke oven gas stream from a coke oven gas source and processing at least a portion of a resulting combined coke oven gas stream in a carbon dioxide separation unit to form a synthesis gas-rich gas stream and a carbon-dioxide rich gas stream; delivering the synthesis gas-rich gas stream to the direct reduction shaft furnace as bustle gas; using the carbon-dioxide rich gas stream as fuel gas in one or more heating units; and delivering the second top gas stream to the direct reduction shaft furnace as bustle gas.
