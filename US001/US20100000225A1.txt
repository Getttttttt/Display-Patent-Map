abstract
    A power generation plant generates electrical power to be distributed to consumers via a power grid. The plant also provides some of the power to a fuel processing facility that provides fuel for the plant, and re-cycles the by-products of the power generation process to provide at least some of the resources the plant uses to generate the electrical power.
