abstract
    Described herein is an apparatus and method for avoiding frost and ice buildup in and on vent pipes that transport a stream of gas from the inside to the outside of a building. The apparatus and method comprise a heat-conducting path that extracts heat energy from the stream of gas exiting the vent pipe, and transfers this energy to the frost and ice condensing surfaces at or near the terminus of the vent pipe. The heat-conducting path comprises a heat pipe. In one embodiment the heat-conducting path further comprises a heat exchanger. The passive transfer of heat energy via the heat-conducting path, from the stream of gas to the condensing surfaces of the vent pipe, avoids frost and ice buildup in or around the terminus of the vent pipe.
