abstract
    A liner fabrication tool includes a handle engaged to a first cam support and a second cam support where each of the cam supports has forward edge. An axle extends between the first cam support and the second cam support. A gripper is rotatably engaged to the axle between the first cam support and the second cam support. The gripper includes a first wall, a second wall, and a base extending between the first wall and the second wall, the base has an opening where the opening is positioned between and proximate to the forward edges. The opening receives a pin of a liner and insulation system where rotation of the handle in a forward direction applies leverage against the first cam support and the second cam support to bind the pin in the opening and compress the liner and insulation system immediately prior to welding.
