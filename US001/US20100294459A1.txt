abstract
    The present invention relates to a system of creating and applying a heated cleaning fluid to a surface. The system includes a housing with a first, a second and a third exhaust gas opening. A first, second, and third heat exchanger are enclosed within the housing. The first and second exchangers are serially arranged, while the third is at an angle relative to the first and second and directly adjacent to the first opening. Super heated exhaust gas flows through first opening and third exchanger. Heated gas flows through the second opening and passes below the third exchanger. Super heated exhaust gas exiting the third exchanger mixes with the heated gas in a mixing chamber of the housing, which is then supplied to the first and second exchangers. Fluid passes through the three exchangers and exits the third exchanger heated. That heated fluid passes to a cleaning wand for application.
