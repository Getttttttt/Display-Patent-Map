abstract
    A waste-heat steam generator has an exhaust gas channel in which at least one evaporator heating surface and at least one preheater heating surface are arranged. The evaporator heating surface and the preheater heating surface are connected together such that the preheater heating surface is arranged upstream of the evaporator heating surface on the feed-water side. The waste-heat steam generator also has a water separator arranged downstream of the evaporator heating surface on the feed-water side. An excess pipe length system is arranged outside of the exhaust gas channel and between the preheater heating surface and the evaporator heating surface on the feed-water side, the system being designed such that the feed water causes an overflow in a rising pipe of the excess pipe length system after completely filling the preheater heating surface and thus reaches the evaporator heating surface via a downpipe.
