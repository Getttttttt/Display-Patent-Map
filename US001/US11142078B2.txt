abstract
    Electric drive system of a hybrid or electric vehicle comprising at least a first and a second battery pack, said first battery pack being formed by a first plurality of equal cells, wherein a cell of said first plurality of cells identifies a first predetermined C-rate coefficient (power/capacity) and said second battery pack being formed by a second plurality of equal cells, wherein a cell of said first plurality of cells identifies a second predetermined C-rate coefficient (power/capacity) higher than said first predetermined coefficient, and wherein the drive system comprises at least a first and a second set of electromagnetic induction windings, respectively independently powered by said first and second battery pack by means of relative first and second inverter.
