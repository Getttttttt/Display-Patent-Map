abstract
    The present invention drives an ejector refrigeration unit using waste heat, such as a combustion gas generated from the outside, etc., and cools a working fluid sucked into a compressor in a power generator using the working fluid that circulates in the ejector refrigeration unit, thereby reducing a compression work of the compressor so that efficiency of a system can be improved.
