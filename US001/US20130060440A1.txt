abstract
    A vehicle braking system includes (a) a rotary machine that functions at least as an electricity generator and that is capable of generating braking torque based on regenerative torque, (b) a first braking control apparatus that electrically controls the braking torque of a mechanical brake that is provided for a wheel, and (c) a second braking control apparatus that replaces one of the braking torque provided by the rotary machine and the braking torque provided by the mechanical brake with another one of the braking torque provided by the rotary machine and the braking torque provided by the mechanical brake while maintaining a target braking torque, the second braking control apparatus correcting the braking torque provided by the rotary machine so that the deviation lessens, if the braking torque of a vehicle has deviation from the target braking torque at time of replacement transition.
