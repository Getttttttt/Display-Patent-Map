abstract
    Certain aspects of natural gas liquid fractionation plant waste heat conversion to simultaneous power, cooling and potable water using integrated mono-refrigerant triple cycle and modified MED system can be implemented as a system that includes two heating fluid circuits thermally coupled to multiple heat sources of a NGL fractionation plant. An integrated triple cycle system, which includes an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), a refrigeration cycle and an ejector refrigeration cycle, is thermally coupled to the first heating fluid circuit. A MED system, configured to produce potable water, thermally coupled to the second heating fluid circuit. The system includes a control system configured to actuate control valves to selectively thermally couple the heating fluid circuits to portions of the heat sources of the NGL fractionation plant.
