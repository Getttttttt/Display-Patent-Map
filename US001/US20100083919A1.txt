abstract
    An engine assembly may include a first heat exchanger, a fluid supply system providing a fluid flow to the first heat exchanger, a fuel system, an engine block defining first and second cylinder bores, a first piston disposed within the first cylinder bore, and a second piston disposed within the second cylinder bore. The first cylinder bore may receive fuel from the fuel system for combustion therein to drive the first piston. The fluid flow may be pressurized within the first heat exchanger and the pressurized fluid may be provided to the second cylinder bore to drive the second piston.
