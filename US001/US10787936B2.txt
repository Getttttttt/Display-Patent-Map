abstract
    An expander of the piston (2) and cylinder (3) type is inverted from normal orientation, with the crankshaft (4) upper most and the cylinder “head” (5) lower most. The cylinder head has a pair of liquid injectors (6, 7) oriented for respective liquids pentane and glycerine to be injected as mists into contact with each other at the bottom of the cylinder. The pentane is vaporised by transfer of latent heat to it from the glycerine. Respective injector valves (9, 10) from high pressure rails (11, 12) fed by pumps (14, 15) are provided. An exhaust valve (16) is opened by a cam (17) driven at crankshaft speed by a chain drive.
