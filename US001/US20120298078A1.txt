abstract
    A method of using fuel in transportation means comprises: (a) providing a heat treatment unit in the transportation means, the heat treatment unit including a through pipe provided with an inlet and an outlet at two end thereof; (b) providing a heat source for the heat treatment unit capable of supplying the through pipe with heat; (c) connecting a fuel tank of the transportation means to the inlet of the through pipe in the heat treatment unit; and (d) connecting an engine of the transportation means to the outlet of the through pipe in the heat treatment unit; whereby fuel contained in the fuel tank is fed through the heat treatment unit to enter the engine, the fuel can be vaporized in the through pipe by the heat source before entering the engine to facilitate fuel vaporization so that fuel consumption and carbon emission can be reduced.
