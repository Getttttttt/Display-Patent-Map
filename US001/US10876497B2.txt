abstract
    Systems and methods are provided for decreasing thermalization time and/or increasing coefficients of performance by adding waste heat. A thermal management system may include a coolant loop and be configured to cool a target component via the coolant loop, the thermal management system may be further configured to heat the target component during a thermalization period with a waste heat source via the same coolant loop with which the thermal management system is configured to cool the target component.
