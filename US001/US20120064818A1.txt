abstract
    A ventilation system for an air conditioning system includes dampers, a heat exchange unit, and a control unit. One damper controls the flow of ambient air into the system. The other damper controls the flow of relief/exhaust air that is cannibalized from return air from a room or space being cooled (or heated) by the air conditioning system. The ventilation system utilizes a control algorithm in the control unit to calculate, at stepped spaced apart increasing room ventilation rates, increasing CO2 concentrations in the air in the room that are below a maximum desired CO2 concentration in a room. The control algorithm permits a control unit in the ventilation system to open and close the dampers to maintain a CO2 concentration in the room that is below the desired CO2 concentration level.
