abstract
    Embodiments of the present disclosure include an air handling module. The air handling module may comprise an exchanger within a housing, a first manifold positioned on a first side of the housing and including a first pair of ports on a first end and a second pair of ports on a second end, and a second manifold positioned on a second side of the housing and including a first pair of ports on a first end and a second pair of ports on a second end. The first pairs of ports may be in fluid communication to transfer air through the exchanger and between the first and second manifolds, and the second pairs of ports may be in fluid communication to transfer air through the exchanger and between the first and second manifolds.
