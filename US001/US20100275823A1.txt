abstract
    A Pyrogen waste treatment and electrical generation combination of systems which is comprised of a combination of pyrolytic combustion systems with a feed stock and a means to convey and pre-treat the feedstock to the combustion system, where the combustion system produces a syngas; co-generators produce hot water and electrical power; and where the co-generator systems may be powered from syngas. It features a means to transfer the syngas to the cogeneration hot water and electrical power generator; a means to transfer hot water and electricity from the cogeneration hot water and electrical power generator to the pyrolytic combustion system; and a means to transfer generated electricity from the co-generator to an end user. It provides significant benefits compared to other devices and is used for a symbiotic and synergistic combination of essentially two systems—a pyrolytic combustion system and a cogeneration electrical power generator.
