abstract
    In certain embodiments, a system comprises an evaporator unit operable to receive an incoming airflow and a flow of refrigerant from an expansion device. The evaporator unit generates a cooled airflow by facilitating heat transfer from the incoming airflow to the flow of refrigerant. The cooled airflow has an absolute humidity less than an absolute humidity of the incoming airflow. The system further comprises a subcooler unit operable to receive the cooled airflow generated by the evaporator unit and the flow of refrigerant from a condenser unit located exterior to a structure. The subcooler unit generates an outgoing airflow by facilitating heat transfer from the flow of refrigerant to the cooled airflow, the outgoing airflow having a relative humidity less than a relative humidity of the cooled airflow. The system further comprises a supply fan operable to provide the outgoing airflow to the structure.
