abstract
    A vehicle carries an energy storage system that powers mobility of the vehicle. The vehicle further carries a direct current input coupling to be connected to a direct current (DC) electrical power source, a DC output coupling, an alternating current (AC) input coupling, an AC output coupling, and electronics carried by the vehicle to control both AC and DC voltage and power levels.
