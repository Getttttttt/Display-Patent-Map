abstract
    Embodiments of a high temperature fluid generator are adapted to heat a fluid to a high temperature using a heat source. The generator employs a forced circulation counter flow design including a furnace section, a convection section and a pair of L-shaped headers connected to tubes in the furnace and convection sections. In various embodiments, the headers are positioned on diagonally opposite corners and convection tubes are positioned at least partially outside of a flue path for the combustion gas.
