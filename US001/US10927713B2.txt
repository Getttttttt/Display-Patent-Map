abstract
    An intake air cooling device includes a water supply line and a heat pump device. The water supply line is configured to send water to a waste heat recovery boiler which is configured to generate steam using heat of an exhaust gas from a gas turbine. The heat pump device is configured to transfer heat of air suctioned by the gas turbine to water flowing through the water supply line and thereby cool the air while heating the water.
