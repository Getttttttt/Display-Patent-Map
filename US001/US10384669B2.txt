abstract
    An apparatus for controlling a vehicle having a motor is provided and includes a driving information sensor that senses driving information of the vehicle including an open value of an APS, an open value of a BPS, a driving wheel speed, a non-driving wheel speed, external temperature, battery temperature, a vehicle speed, and a shift stage. A driving motor generates a driving force and is operated as a power generator when the vehicle coasts to generate electric energy. An ABS that adjusts a braking force applied to a driving wheel. A controller changes a coast regeneration torque subject to regenerative braking by the driving motor when the vehicle is coasting, based on a difference between a driving wheel speed and a non-driving wheel speed, correction temperature determined based on the external temperature and the battery temperature, a friction coefficient of a road, and an operation condition of the ABS.
