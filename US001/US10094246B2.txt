abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for heating an engine and generating energy from a common waste heat recovery system. In one example, a method comprises, responsive to a first condition, expanding a working fluid of a waste heat recovery system via an expander to generate electricity, and responsive to a second condition, compressing the working fluid of the waste heat recovery system via the expander to transfer heat to an engine.
