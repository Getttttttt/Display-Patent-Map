abstract
    Elongated, smaller-diameter tube heat pipes have an airflow arrangement that allows for short distances between evaporating and condensing sections of the heat pipe. The heat pipe is exposed to multiple alternate hot and cold zones adjacent to each other. Each evaporator zone accepts input heat to cause evaporation of the working fluid in the wick of the immediate vicinity. The vapor produced moves to either side by local pressure differences to condense in the two adjacent condenser zones where it is absorbed by the wick as a liquid and flows in the wick back to adjacent evaporator zones at each side. Each evaporator zone creates two fluid loops whereby evaporated working fluid splits up left and right, condenses in adjacent condenser zones and flows back to the evaporator zone as a liquid within the wick. Therefore, the overall tube length can be increased indefinitely, without traditional degradation of performance.
