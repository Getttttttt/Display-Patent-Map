abstract
    An internal combustion engine wherein a thermo potential heat flow in combustion is maximised by providing a feedback of an optimised amount of thermo potential heat flow that is modulated in the exhaust media, into the air intake, and a method of providing feedback comprises producing a shock wave of pulse of exhaust media and pulse of intake air on the opposite side of a high temperature sustainable wire screen modem thereby transferring the thermo potential heat energy flow from the exhaust media to the air intake.
