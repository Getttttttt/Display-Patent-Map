abstract
    A data center includes a mobile enclosure having an interior space. The interior space includes a first section and a second section, where the first section is separated from the second section by a first divider. The first section houses a rack having a first side and a second side, where the rack is positioned to separate the first section into a first aisle and a second aisle such that fluid flow between the first aisle and the second aisle is substantially prevented other than through the rack. The first aisle includes a fluid delivery device and the second aisle includes a fluid removal device, where the second section facilitates fluid communication between the fluid removal device and the fluid delivery device.
