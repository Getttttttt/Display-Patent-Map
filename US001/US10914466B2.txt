abstract
    A method for operating a heating boiler and variant embodiments thereof are proposed. A working fluid is heated in the heating boiler consisting of at least two chambers by the heat of at least one heat carrier, and, by means of at least one of the heat exchangers in the heating boiler, a change in the temperature of the heat carrier in relation to the working fluid in the chambers is realized by supplying a more greatly heated heat carrier to the chambers containing a more greatly heated working fluid and, correspondingly, supplying a less greatly heated heat carrier to the chambers containing a less greatly heated working fluid, and, after heating, the working fluid is conducted out of the chamber via at least one channel or valve for use. The technical result is an increase in the efficiency of the heat recovering.
