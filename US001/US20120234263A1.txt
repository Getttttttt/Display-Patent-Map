abstract
    Embodiments of processes and an apparatus for generating steam are provided. The process comprises the steps of indirectly heating water in a first thermosyphon heat exchanger with a first hot stream to form a first stream of heated water comprising steam. The first stream of heated water is fluidly communicated to a first steam drum via natural circulation. Water is indirectly heated in a second thermosyphon heat exchanger with a second hot stream from the process unit to form a second stream of heated water comprising steam. The second stream of heated water is fluidly communicated to the first steam drum via natural circulation. Steam is recovered from the first steam drum.
