abstract
    A process for producing a fume free connector pipe is disclosed. The connector pipe is placed in a curing oven at a start temperature, the oven having a convective air CFM and an intake/exhaust air CFM. The oven temperature is increased over an increase time period to a hold temperature and the connector pipe is heated at the hold temperature for a hold time period then removed from the curing oven after a total amount of time, the total amount of time being the increase time period plus the hold time period.
