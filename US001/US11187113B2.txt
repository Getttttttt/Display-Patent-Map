abstract
    An electric power generating system includes an autoclave coupled to a natural gas source, an oxygen source, and having a pressure reducing outlet valve. A high-pressure pump provides a solution of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium carbonate solution under pressure to the autoclave. An exothermic reaction generates high-pressure steam for electrical power generation. A crystallizer receives ammonium carbonate from the reaction for the formation of crystallized ammonium carbonate fertilizer.
