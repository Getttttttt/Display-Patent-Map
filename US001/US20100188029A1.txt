abstract
    A braking system for an aircraft provided with undercarriage, wherein an axial-flux reversible electric machine is set between the wheel and the frame of the undercarriage; current-dissipating resistors are provided, which can be connected to the windings of the axial-flux reversible electric machine during rotation of said wheel for dissipating by the Joule effect the induced currents generated by the axial-flux electric machine, which behaves as current generator, and producing a braking effect that slows down the movement of the wheel, thus exerting a braking action.
