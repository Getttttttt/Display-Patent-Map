abstract
    An HVAC system that utilizes an air-to-air heat exchanger includes an HVAC ductwork section including a fan, and a filter assembly in fluid flow communication with the HVAC ductwork section. The filter assembly has a filter compartment having an opening oriented generally transverse to a direction of air flow through the filter assembly. A compressive member is provided on at least a portion of a perimeter extending around the opening. The compressive member is adjustable between an installation configuration in which the compressive member is spaced from a position that is to be occupied by a filter when the filter is installed in the filter compartment and an installed configuration in which the compressive member engages at least a portion of one of an upstream and a downstream face of the filter when the filter is positioned in the filter compartment.
