abstract
    An apparatus for recovering energy from freezer exhaust includes a heat exchanger disposed for coaction with a freezer in a first atmosphere, the heat exchanger having a first heat transfer surface in communication with the freezer exhaust and the first atmosphere, and a second heat transfer surface in communication with the freezer exhaust and the first atmosphere; a discharge conduit in communication with the first and second heat transfer surfaces, and extending to a second atmosphere remote from the first atmosphere; a first valve assembly disposed for coaction with the first and second heat transfer surfaces, the first valve assembly movable to direct a flow of the freezer exhaust to a select one of the first and second heat transfer surfaces or optionally to direct the flow to both the first and second heat transfer surfaces; and a first blower to move a flow of the first atmosphere to a select one or both of the first and second heat transfer surfaces for heat transfer with the flow of the freezer exhaust.
