abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric machine, friction brakes, and a controller. The electric machine is configured to recharge a battery during regenerative braking. The friction brakes are configured to apply torque to wheels of the vehicle to decelerate the vehicle. The controller is programmed to, responsive to an anti-lock braking event, adjust a regenerative braking torque of the electric machine based on a difference between a desired wheel slip ratio and an actual wheel slip ratio.
