abstract
    A control device for electric motor vehicle uses the motor as the traveling driving source. The control device for electric motor vehicle is configured to decelerate by the regenerative braking force from the motor. The control device for electric motor vehicle is configured to detect the amount of the accelerator operation, detect the motor rotation speed proportionate to the traveling speed of the electric motor vehicle, and calculate the motor rotation speed estimated value according to the state of the electric motor vehicle. Additionally, the control device for electric motor vehicle is configured to detect or estimate the resistance component unrelated to the gradient from the vehicle state and correct the motor rotation speed estimated value according to the resistance component. Further, the control device for electric motor vehicle is configured to calculate the feedback torque to stop the electric motor vehicle based on the motor rotation speed and calculate the feedforward torque to compensate the feedback torque based on the corrected motor rotation speed estimated value. The control device for electric motor vehicle is configured to calculate the motor torque command value and control the motor based on the calculated motor torque command value. When the amount of the accelerator operation is equal to or less than the predetermined value and the electric motor vehicle is just before the stop of the vehicle, the motor torque command value is converged to 0 based on the feedback torque and the feedforward torque together with the reduction in the traveling speed.
