abstract
    An apparatus for harnessing energy from a wheel travelling on a railroad track includes an elongate body with a plurality of pockets spaced apart along a top surface thereof. Energy collection devices are installed in the pockets, and each includes an actuator extending proud of the top surface. A mounting assembly releasably mounts the body adjacent to the railroad track so that the actuators of the energy collection devices are positioned in a path of the wheel to be actuated thereby. The energy collection devices may be coupled to a low pressure fluid supply reservoir and a high pressure fluid accumulator, and used to pump fluid from the reservoir to the accumulator upon actuation.
