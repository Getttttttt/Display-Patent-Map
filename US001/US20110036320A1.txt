abstract
    A waste-to-energy cogeneration system is described in various embodiments. The system can convert certain fuel-laden waste to thermal energy and electrical power. In certain embodiments, fuel-laden waste which has not been pre-filtered or pre-treated to remove particulates and water is deposited in the cogeneration system and prepared by the system for combustion in an unmodified diesel engine. The fuel-laden waste can comprise oils, greases and fats from food preparation which are contaminated with water and particulates. Thermal and mechanical energy produced by the engine are utilized to provide thermal energy and electrical power external to the cogeneration system.
