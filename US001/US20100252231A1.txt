abstract
    Embodiments of the present invention provide a data centre, comprising data centre air directing means for directing data centre air from the data centre through a first side of one or more heat exchangers; external air directing means for directing external air from external to the data centre through a second side of the one or more heat exchangers; and adiabatic cooling means for adiabatically cooling the external air prior to entering the one or more heat exchangers, such that the external air flowing through the second side of the one or more heat exchangers indirectly cools the data centre air flowing through the first side of the one or more heat exchangers. Embodiments of the present invention may be realised in which the data centre is a moveable data centre.
