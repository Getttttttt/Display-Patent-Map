abstract
    An exhaust gas turbine generator system for a vehicle that has an internal combustion engine with an exhaust system is provided. The exhaust system comprises a turbine, an electrical generator, a waste gate, and an electronic control module. The turbine is disposed in fluid communication with an exhaust gas system of an internal combustion engine to allow fluid flow between the turbine and the exhaust gas system. The electrical generator connects to the turbine. The waste gate is disposed in fluid communication with the exhaust gas system of the internal combustion engine. The waste gate is positionable between an open position and a closed position in response to an output signal from the electronic control module. The fluid flow in the exhaust gas system to the turbine is reduced when the waste gate is positioned to the open position.
