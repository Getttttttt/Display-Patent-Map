abstract
    An engine system in which the fuel source is vaporized by the heat of the exhaust pipe of the engine prior to being introduced into the combustion chamber of the engine system. This vaporization of the fuel source prior to combustion allows for the disclosed engine to utilize anything as a fuel source that can be ignited in a vaporized form, even that, if not vaporized prior to ignition, would not be a possible combustible fuel source.
