abstract
    A system and associated devices that can be used to transform vibrational energy absorbed by the wheels of an automobile into captured energy for use by the automobile. A method to charge an automobile's electric battery without burning fuel and in a shorter time period than prior approaches. A method to assure a smooth drive for an automobile by reducing vibrations associated with the automobile. An apparatus that provides for the vector superposition of the magnetic fields from a plurality of adjacent permanent magnets and maximizes radial magnetic flux density within coil windings for optimal power generation and energy conversion efficiency of an automobile. A system, method, and apparatus for compressing air resulting from the passage of a automobile over a roadway, thereby providing generation of power for the automobile.
