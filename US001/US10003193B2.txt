abstract
    A power supply includes a load, an electric power line connected to the load, first and second DC power supplies which supply electric power to the load, an electric power converter connected between the electric power line and the first and the second DC power supplies, and a controller controlling the electric power converter. The first DC power supply serves for a voltage control, while the second DC power supply serves for an electric power control. The controller sets a difference between an electric power requested by the load and target output electric power of the first DC power supply as target output electric power of the second DC power supply, and compensates the target output electric power of the first DC power supply in accordance with a difference between the actual and the target output electric powers of the second DC power supply.
