abstract
    In a control method for a fuel cell system, a fuel cell side converter that is provided between a fuel cell and an inverter is controlled to step up a fuel cell voltage to an inverter terminal voltage supplied to the inverter. A margin voltage is set to guarantee step-up operation or interruption of operation of the fuel cell side converter. A directly connected state or a voltage transforming state regarding an operation state of an energy storage device side converter is selected such that the inverter terminal voltage is higher than a sum of the margin voltage and the fuel cell voltage. The energy storage device side converter does not transform the energy storage device voltage in the directly connected state. The energy storage device side converter transforms the energy storage device voltage to the inverter terminal voltage in the voltage transforming state.
