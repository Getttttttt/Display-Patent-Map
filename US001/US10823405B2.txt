abstract
    Integration of an oxyfuel combustion boiler at elevated pressures and a heat exchanger is achieved to produce carbon dioxide by feeding flue gas comprising carbon dioxide and water from the oxyfuel combustion boiler to a direct contact cooler column wherein water is condensed at a temperature of 0 to 10° C. lower than its dew point; feeding a portion of the condensed water from the direct contact cooler column to the oxyfuel combustion boiler; feeding a portion of the carbon dioxide from the direct contact cooler column to the oxyfuel combustion boiler; and recovering a portion of the carbon dioxide from the direct contact cooler column.
