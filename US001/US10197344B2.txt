abstract
    A heating ventilation and cooling system includes an energy recovery ventilator (ERV). The ERV is configured to produce an inlet airstream and an exhaust airstream. An enthalpy wheel within the energy recovery ventilator is operable to transport heat between the inlet and exhaust airstreams. A pressure transducer is configured to determine a backpressure across the enthalpy wheel. A controller is configured to determine, in response to the backpressure, an operational characteristic of the enthalpy wheel.
