abstract
    An air passage switching device (18) provided in a heat exchange ventilation device (50) including a discharge air passage (7), and a bypass air passage (19) branching off from the discharge air passage (7), to switch between the discharge air passage (7) and the bypass air passage (19) in the heat exchange ventilation device (50) through which airflow passes, the air passage switching device (18) including a first air-passage switching unit including first air-passage switching members, each of which has a rotational shaft extending in a direction parallel to a bottom surface (1b) of the heat exchange ventilation device (50), and a second air-passage switching unit including a second air-passage switching member having a rotational shaft extending in a direction perpendicular to the bottom surface (1b) of the heat exchange ventilation device (50), wherein the air passage switching device (18) switches between the discharge air passage (7) and the bypass air passage (19) to which air drawn into a casing (1) from a room is directed, in accordance with a rotational position of the first and second air-passage switching members.
