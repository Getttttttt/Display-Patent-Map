abstract
    Provided is a vehicle transmission apparatus including dual clutch transmission capable of improving travel stability even when running on a rough road. The apparatus comprises input shafts and output shafts to which rotational power from the input shafts is transmitted in a gear-shiftable manner; clutches that disengageably transmit rotational power from engine to the input shafts; rotational sensors that detect number of revolutions of wheels differentially driven through a differential device connected to both the output shafts to be capable of transmitting rotational power; a motor generator that rotates integrally with an input shaft and a controller that controls engagement/disengagement of the clutches, gear shifting between an input shaft and an output shaft and between another input shaft and another output shaft, and a regenerative operation of the motor generator according to signals from the rotational sensors.
