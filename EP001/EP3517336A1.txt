abstract
    An auxiliary power unit equipped wheel support bearing assembly (1) is provided which includes a wheel support bearing assembly (2) and an auxiliary power unit (3). The auxiliary power unit (3) is of a direct drive design that includes a stator (18) mounted to a stationary ring (4) of the wheel support bearing assembly (2) and a motor rotor (19) mounted to a rotational ring (5) of the wheel support bearing assembly (2). An entirety of the auxiliary power unit (3) is sized to extend less than an outer peripheral segment (17b) of a brake rotor (17), with the outer peripheral segment (17b) defining an area against which a brake caliper (16) is intended to be pushed. The auxiliary power unit (3) is, with respect to an axial direction, sized to be situated between a hub flange (7) of the wheel support bearing assembly (2) and a mounting face (4a) of the wheel support bearing assembly (2) for mounting to a vehicle body of a vehicle.
