abstract
    A recuperator (24) inserted in the exhaust duct (18) of a gas turbine engine (10) includes a casing (30) surrounding a core (28) having spiral cross channels. Inlet and outlet openings are defined in the casing (30) for the passage of hot exhaust gases (E) through the exhaust channels in the core (28). Feeder members (38) extend radially across the outlet opening for passing the pre-combustion stage air (P3) through the air channels of the core (28), and header (38) members extend radially across the inlet opening of the casing (30) for receiving and redirecting air from the air channels in the core (28) towards the combustor section (14). The feeder (38) and header (40) members each have a tapered configuration from the casing (30) to the axial center of the casing (30) so as to maintain a relatively constant pressure over the radial extent of the respective feeders (38) and headers (40).
