abstract
    The object of the present invention is to carry out a highly efficient power generation or to efficiently use an exhaust heat of a low temperature. A steam turbine plant includes a steam turbine 1 and a heating unit configured to heat a working fluid to be supplied to the steam turbine 1. The heating unit includes a first heat source 14 using a fossil fuel or a second heat source 8 using an extracted steam from the steam turbine 1, and a third heat source 44 not using a fossil fuel but using a waste exhaust combustion gas.
