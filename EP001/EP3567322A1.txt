abstract
    An air purification monitoring system (10) for monitoring an air purification apparatus (50) adapted to purify air in an enclosed space (1) is disclosed. The air purification apparatus (50) at least comprises a first inlet (55) for receiving indoor air from the enclosed space (1), a second inlet (57) for receiving outdoor air from an outdoor space and at least one outlet (53) coupled to the first and second inlets (55, 57); a filter arrangement (61, 63) positioned in between the first and second inlets (55, 57) and the at least one outlet (53); and an airflow displacement arrangement (65, 67, 69) arranged to generate at least a first airflow (81) from the first inlet (55) to the at least one outlet (53) and a second airflow (82) from the second inlet (57) to the at least one outlet (53). The air purification monitoring system (10) at least comprises a processor (31) arranged to generate a control signal for the airflow displacement arrangement (65, 67, 69) as a function of a first unfavourable matter concentration within the enclosed space (1) and a second unfavourable matter concentration in the outdoor air, said control signal causing the airflow displacement arrangement (65, 67, 69) to generate at least the first airflow (81) at a first airflow rate and the second airflow (82) at a second airflow rate. Also disclosed are an air purification apparatus, an air purification apparatus control method and a computer program product.
