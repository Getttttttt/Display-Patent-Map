abstract
    The invention concerns a valve device (12, 120, 120') comprising: a duct (23) and a duct opening (24); a valve seat (32) arranged circumferentially around the duct opening (24); a movable valve member (26) for restricting a flow of fluid through the duct (23); and a valve actuator (27) for moving the valve member (26); wherein the valve member (26) is provided with a valve sealing element (31) in the form of a sealing surface for sealing against the seat (32) around the duct opening (24), wherein the valve member (26) is movable towards and away from the duct opening (24) in an axial direction thereof, wherein the valve seat (32) and the sealing surface (31) face each other in the axial direction so as to, when brought in contact with each other, define a first end position of the valve member (26) in which the valve device (12, 120, 120') is closed, wherein the valve member (26) is movable between the closed first end position and a second end position in which the valve member sealing surface (31) is located at an axial distance from the valve seat (32) and the valve device (12, 120, 120') is open; The invention is characterized in that the valve member (26) in addition to the valve sealing element (31) is provided with a valve controlling element (33) in the form of an elongated tapered end portion with a tip end facing the duct (23), wherein the tapered end portion (33) is arranged to be inserted through the opening (24) and into the duct (23) as the valve member is moved towards the valve seat, wherein the actuator (27) is configured to be capable of holding the valve member (26) in at least one intermediate position between the first and second end positions, in which intermediate position the tapered end portion (33) occupies a portion of a cross-sectional fluid through-flow area defined by the duct (23) so as to partly restrict a flow of fluid through the duct (23). The invention also concerns a system (1) of Rankine type for recovering waste heat of an internal combustion engine (2), wherein the system comprises a valve device of the above type.
