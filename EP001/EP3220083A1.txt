abstract
    The present invention provides a process for the treatment of iron- and carbon-containing particulate waste, the process comprising:providing an iron- and carbon-containing particulate waste having a moisture content of less than 80wt%;providing a cyclonic dryer driven by a flow of gases,providing a smelting furnace having a treatment chamber, wherein the treatment chamber comprises an inlet in fluid communication with an outlet of the cyclonic dryer and comprising one or more oxygen inlets,drying the iron- and carbon-containing particulate waste in the cyclonic drying chamber to form a dried iron-containing particulate waste,passing the dried iron-containing particulate waste from the outlet of the cyclonic dryer to the inlet of the treatment chamber,heating the dried iron- and carbon-containing particulate waste in the treatment chamber of the smelting furnace to form a slag and, optionally, a molten iron layer, and wherein the dried iron- and carbon-containing particulate waste is heated by combustion of the carbon to form a CO-containing off-gas by addition of oxygen through the one or more oxygen inlets.
