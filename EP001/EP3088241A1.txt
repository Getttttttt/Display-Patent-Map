abstract
    Consumption of regenerated power by a regeneration inverter for electric railroads must rely on lighting and power supplies in yards, and can only consume a fraction of the regenerated power generated by a train. Switching switches switching a connection between electric car lines and a storage medium of a power storage device are connected respectively to the positive and negative electrodes on the direct current side of the regeneration inverter. The switching switch connected to the regeneration inverter positive electrode side performs control so as to switch to the electric car line side when charging the storage medium and to the storage medium side when discharging. The switching switch connected to the regeneration inverter negative electrode side is configured so as to switch to the storage medium charging side terminal through the regeneration inverter when charging, and to the negative electrode side of the electric car lines when discharging.
