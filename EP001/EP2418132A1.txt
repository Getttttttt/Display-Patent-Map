abstract
    At a time (t3) when a vehicle speed is decreased below a switching-start vehicle speed and the switching from regenerative braking to fluid pressure braking is performed, even if a slave cylinder is caused to be operated by driving an electric motor at the same time of starting the reduction of regenerative braking force, the increase of fluid pressure braking force is delayed by an ineffective stroke in the slave cylinder. Accordingly, a temporary drop of total braking force of the regenerative braking force and fluid pressure braking force is generated. However, at a time (t2) when a vehicle speed is decreased below a switching-preparation-start vehicle speed, the electric motor is, beforehand, caused to drive slightly to cancel out the ineffective stroke in the slave cylinder. This can prevent a temporary drop of the total braking force of the regenerative braking force and fluid pressure braking force at the time of the switching, and can thereby prevent deterioration of brake feeling.
