abstract
    A method for thermal conversion of waste characterized in that the waste (101, 102) is processed in a mineraliser (139) in a form of a substantially longitudinal, rotatable tube with fixed an/or adjustable elements (205 - 210) located therein for scattering a material during the rotation of the tube, whereas in the mineraliser (139) there commences a continuous process of gasification of a batch material takes place, and wherein the batch material is transformed into a hot post-reaction gas and inorganic waste whereas during the mineralization process there is monitored the content of carbon oxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) in the post-reaction gas and there is set an amount of the gasification agent input to the mineraliser (139) so as to maximize the content of the carbon oxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) in the post-reaction gas and to keep the temperature of the post-reaction gas in the range from 300°C to 700°C, after which the post-reaction gas is input to a catalytic gas purification installation, in which in the catalytic reactor (143) there is introduced oxygen into the post-reaction gas, and subsequently the purified gas is input to an installation (146, 147) for generation of electricity and/or heat.
