abstract
    A heat exchanger 2 is for use in an energy recovery system X1 to be mounted on a vessel Y1 including an engine 200, a supercharger 100 and an economizer 300, the heat exchanger 2 including: a first heat section 2A for heating a working medium by supercharged air from the supercharger 100; a second heat section 2B for heating the supercharged air by steam generated by the economizer 300 before the supercharged air flows into the first heat section 2A; and a third heat section 2C for heating the working medium having been heated in the first section 2A by the supercharged air which is to be heated in the second section 2B.
