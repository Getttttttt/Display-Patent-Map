abstract
    Method of continuous processing of power resources to post-pyrolysis hydrocarbons in association with the production of construction materials is characteristic by the fact that construction material produced in burning process of temperature close to sintering point is introduced in parallel flow with energy raw materials by means of equipment (4) ensuring required tightness and is subject to decomposition with the utilization of heat given up by hot construction material during dislocation of components in the equipment (8), while solid and gas fraction are separated to construction aggregate and volatile hydrocarbons which are fractionated in condensing process to volatile gasses and liquig fraction and non-condensed gasses are directed to burning of construction materials while out dropped hydrocarbon fractions are transported to storage tanks and / or subject to further processing. The energy raw material subject to pyrolysis process can be preliminarily heated with flue gasses from burning of construction material. The hard condensable gasses from pyrolysis are used for burning of construction materials and / or heating of energy raw material.
