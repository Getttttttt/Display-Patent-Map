abstract
    A power plant having a steam cycle and a water cycle. In order to initiate a load jump steam extracted from the steam cycle is condensed against boiler feed water and directed back into a cold reheat line (10a) between a steam turbine (6) and a reheater (4).
title
    A steam power plant with power boost through the use of top heater drain reheating
