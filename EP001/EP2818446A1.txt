abstract
    A hydraulic drive device (16) for cargo handling vehicle has: a tank (19); a pump (17) for drawing in a hydraulic oil from the tank and supplying the hydraulic oil to hydraulic cylinders; an electric motor (18) for driving the pump; a solenoid-controlled proportional valve (48) disposed between an inlet port of the pump and a bottom chamber of an up-and-down hydraulic cylinder (4) and configured to open with a valve travel depending upon a control input of a descent control of an up-and-down control member; a pressure compensation valve (50) disposed between a branch portion located between the pump and the solenoid-controlled proportional valve and the tank and configured to open with a valve travel depending upon a pressure difference between pressures upstream and downstream of the solenoid-controlled proportional valve; and a valve (53) disposed between the pressure compensation valve and the tank and configured to be switched between an open position and a close position.
