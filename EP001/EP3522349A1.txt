abstract
    A power conversion device for a railroad vehicle according to one embodiment of the present invention is configured such that a first power conversion device for converting first DC power from a DC power source into AC power, and a second power conversion device for converting the first DC power into second DC power having a voltage level different from the voltage level of the first DC power and for storing the second DC power in a power storage means, are connected in parallel to the DC power source. The power conversion device controls the second power conversion device on the basis of a charging/discharging control command for the power storage means, and a voltage oscillation component superimposed on the first DC power. As a result, a resonance phenomenon in a DC section, to which the first and second power conversion devices are connected in parallel, can be prevented without adjusting control parameters and circuits of the first power conversion device. Consequently, emergency travel and effective utilization of power can be easily achieved by mounting a power storage device in an existing vehicle drive system, for example.
