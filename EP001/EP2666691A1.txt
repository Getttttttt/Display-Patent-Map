abstract
    The present invention effectively uses engine output in a "regeneration" process when an automobile is stopped. The automobile includes a regeneration control unit for, when regenerating a post-treatment device (20) while a hybrid automobile (1) is stopped, performing a high-load operation of an engine (10) by operating an electric motor (13) as a generator by the engine (10). A memory of a hybrid ECU (18) retains a power generation map in which are recorded the rotational speed of the engine (10) and/or a power generating torque when regenerating the post-treatment device (20), which correspond to the amount of particulate accumulation of the post-treatment device (20). The regeneration control unit constitutes a regeneration control device for determining, on the basis of the power generation map, the rotational speed and/or the power generating torque of the engine (10) when the engine (10) operates the electric motor (13) as a generator, which are corresponding to the amount of particular accumulation of the post-treatment device (20), when regenerating the post-treatment device (20) while the hybrid automobile (1) is stopping.
