abstract
    A heat recovery steam generator (1) is disclosed, comprising a main casing (2) with a hot gas inlet (3), a plurality of tube bundles (4-8) arranged inside said casing, wherein a first tube bundle or group of tube bundles (4, 5) form a hot portion (11) of said generator, and a second tube bundle or group of tube bundles (6-8) form a cold portion (12) of said generator, the hot portion having a mean temperature, under normal operating conditions, greater than said cold portion, said generator also comprising a multi-louver shutter operable between said hot portion and said cold portion, to provide a thermal insulation means between said hot portion and cold portion.
