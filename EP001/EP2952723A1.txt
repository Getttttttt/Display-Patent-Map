abstract
    A waste heat recovery device for a marine vessel includes a heat exchanger recovering heat from an exhaust fume that is discharged from an engine and heating a first refrigerant under uniform pressure, a turbine driven by adiabatically expanding the first refrigerant that is heated under uniform pressure, a condenser condensing the first refrigerant that is adiabatically expanded, and a heat exchanging pump compressing the first refrigerant that is condensed, to be re-circulated in the heat exchanger.
