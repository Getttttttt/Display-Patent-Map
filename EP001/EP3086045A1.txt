abstract
    The invention refers to an air treating apparatus comprising a reversible thermo-hygrometric processing complex of an air-to-air heat pump type for the processing, from a thermo-hygrometric viewpoint, of a pair of air flows to be treated coming from an external environment that surrounds a usage environment into a pair of treated air flows, and a conveying section placed downstream of said thermo-hygrometric processing complex to convey said pair of treated air flows to said usage environment and to the external environment. The invention also refers to an operating procedure for said apparatus
