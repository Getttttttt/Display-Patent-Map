abstract
    A ventilation arrangement (1) of a building, having at least one supply air channel (2) that has at least one heat exchanger radiator (4) of supply air, and at least one exhaust air channel (5), which has at least one heat exchanger radiator (7) of exhaust air, at least one heat exchanger circuit (8) based on the circulation of heat transfer liquid to conduct heating/cooling to the heat exchanger radiators of the supply air channel and exhaust air channel, and a control unit (20) to change the amount of air to be replaced in the building by changing the amount of air brought in the building through the supply air channel and by changing in the corresponding proportion the amount of exhaust air removed through the exhaust air channel. The control unit (20) is adapted to change the surface area of said supply air and exhaust air heat exchanger radiators (4, 7), which takes part in the heat exchange, in relation to a change in the amount of air replaced in the building, and the amount of heat transfer liquid fed to said supply air and exhaust air radiator (4, 7), in relation to the change in the amount of air replaced in the building without substantially changing the rate of flow of the heat transfer liquid in the heat exchanger radiators (4, 7).
