abstract
    The present invention concerns a wind power recovery system (1) and method for recovering wind power energy within a guided vehicle (2), the system (1) comprising: - a bearing structure (11) configured for being removably installed on-board the guided vehicle (2); - a wind turbine module (12) fixed to the bearing structure (11) and comprising at least one wind turbine (121); - at least one generator (13) for converting rotational mechanical energy of the wind turbine (121) into electrical energy, said generator (13) being supported by the bearing structure (11); - a control unit (14) fixed to the bearing structure (11) and configured for automatically controlling and commanding an opening or closing of a mechanical grille (4) for regulating an entry of frontal air flow (3) through the wind turbine (121); - a connector (16) for electrically connecting the generator to an electrical network of the guided vehicle (2) in order to provide said electrical network with said electrical energy.
