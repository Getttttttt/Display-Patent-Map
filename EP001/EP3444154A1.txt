abstract
    A braking force control method detects a wheel speed (w) of a vehicle (1), generates a holding braking force for holding the stopped state of the vehicle (1), regardless of whether or not a brake (3) is operated by a driver of the vehicle (1), when it is determined that the vehicle (1) has stopped, based on the wheel speed (w) detected in the state in which a braking force is applied to the vehicle (1), and delays the period in which the holding braking force is generated, in accordance with the friction coefficient of a road surface in the traveling path of the vehicle (1).
