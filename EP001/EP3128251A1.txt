abstract
    The present invention relates to a heat exchanger comprising: a burner for combusting a mixture of air and fuel; and a heat exchange unit in which heat is exchanged between combustion gas caused by the combustion of the burner and a heating medium, wherein the heat exchange unit includes a plurality of unit plates stacked on each other, and a sensible-heat exchange unit and a latent-heat exchange unit coaxially disposed around the burner are integrally formed with the unit plates.
