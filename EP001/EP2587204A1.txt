abstract
    A first aspect of the invention concerns a blast furnace top gas treatment process. The process comprises removing CO2 from top gas (16) collected at the top of a blast furnace (16). The removal of CO2 from the top gas is carried out using CO2-absorbing washing liquid (42, 46), the washing liquid being heated to release the absorbed CO2. Another part (26) of the CO2-depleted top gas is burnt in a regenerative heater in order to heat up the regenerative heater and excess heat thereby produced is used at least in part to heat the washing liquid. A second aspect of the invention concerns a blast furnace top gas treatment installation configured for carrying out the process.
