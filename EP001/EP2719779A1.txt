abstract
    Process for producing metal from ore in a blast furnace and blast-furnace plant for use in said process, whereby oxygen is heated in an oxygen preheating installation upstream of the blast furnace and hot oxygen thus obtained is introduced into the blast furnace and whereby CO is extracted from the blast furnace gas to generate CO-fraction of the blast furnace gas and the CO-fraction thus obtained is likewise introduced into the blast furnace.
