abstract
    The present invention provides a ship load adjusting device for adjusting the load of the ship by burning, by means of comprising a raw material storage portion for storing raw material and a collective/storage tank, which are symmetrically mounted on the front end of the ship with an incinerator at the middle, and provides a ship load adjustment device comprising: a first ballast, which is disposed at the raw material storage tank and at the lower portion of the ship, for storing sea water; a second ballast for storing sea water, which is disposed at the lower portion of the collection/storage tank storing ashes produced after burning the raw material in the raw material storage tank, and at the lower portion of the ship; a first control device for controlling the inflow/outflow of the sea water between the first ballast and the second ballast; a third ballast for storing sea water which allows the inflow/outflow of sea water according to the reduced amount of the raw material due to burning of the raw material; and a second control device for controlling the inflow/outflow of sea water in the third ballast. By providing the ship processing marine waste into a resource including the ship load adjustment device, the present invention can not only reduce the cost of land transportation required to process marine waste which is accumulated in the sea but also can effectively and fundamentally prevent environmental problems that occur in the process of transporting, because the marine waste is processed on the sea by the ship of the present invention. Also, the present invention can fundamentally resolve the secondary environmental problems, such as securing reclaimed land and soil pollution due to conventional burying of marine waste in the land, and transforms the problems of simply burying marine waste, which emits high heat, into creating energy by means of burning. In addition, by using the converted energy for sailing the ship to the locations where marine waste is accumulated, the use of crude oil traditionally required for sailing can be dramatically reduced to cut costs, and furthermore, the converted energy source is high-quality electricity that can be supplied to island regions, which are marginalized areas in terms of power supply, thereby effectively reducing costs for building an additional power generating facility in the island regions and contributing to facilitating access to the energy source.
