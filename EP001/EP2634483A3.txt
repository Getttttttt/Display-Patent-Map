abstract
    In order to overcome the problems that earlier methods have experienced, a method for providing heat to a carbon dioxide (CO2) post combustion capture process is proposed, comprising the steps:a) generating electricity from a boiler (A) by feeding steam from said boiler (A) to one or more turbines (B, C, D);b) feeding flue gas from said boiler (A) to a waste heat recovery unit (M);c) capturing heat in said waste heat recovery unit (M); andd) feeding heat to said post combustion capture process.
