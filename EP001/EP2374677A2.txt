abstract
    Hybrid vehicle comprising at least one electrical machine, one or more brake systems and a control system, which vehicle comprises an activation unit adapted to generating an activation signal which is arranged to activate the control system to calculate the retardation a*(t) required for bringing the vehicle to a halt solely by means of the brake torque which the electrical machine can provide. The retardation is calculated by means of a set of retardation parameters comprising at least one from among current vehicle speed, maximum and minimum limits for the retardation, and maximum brake torque for the electrical machine or machines, and the control system is further adapted to calculating a brake force F*tr which is the brake force effecting the retardation a*(t), and to generating one or more brake signals based on F*tr to the electrical machine or machines for braking of the vehicle to a halt.
