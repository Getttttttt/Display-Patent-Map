abstract
    This invention relates to a method of ventilating a space (130) of a building (132), by means of a ventilation system (100) comprising a first air fan (108, 112), an air density comparator (114), and a control device (116) connected with the density comparator and with the air fan, which method comprises:comparing the outside air density with the inside air density by means of the air density comparator and generating a difference signal representing the difference of density;detecting the difference signal by means of the control device; andcontrolling, by means of the control device, the speed of the first air fan on basis of the difference signal such that the difference is kept at a desired level.
