abstract
    An air-conditioning system of the present invention is provided with transport means 16 that sends, to an evaporator 15, a cooling fluid that exchanges heat with a refrigerant at the evaporator 15, and a first heat exchanger 22 that exchanges heat between ambient air and the cooling fluid that has undergone the heat exchange at the evaporator 15. A sensible heat exchange cycle 2001 is formed by annularly connecting the evaporator 15, the heat exchanger 22, and the transport means 16 by using a pipe. This system is also provided with an air-sending unit 32 that sends air to a second heat exchanger 32, moisture absorbing-and-desorbing devices 23a and 23b that are provided at a passage of the air sent by the air-sending unit 32 and that are disposed in front of and behind the first heat exchanger 22, and an air-path switching device 24a that reverses a passing direction of air passing through the moisture absorbing-and-desorbing device 23a, the first heat exchanger 22, and the moisture absorbing-and-desorbing device 23b.
