abstract
    Provided is a DC/DC converter apparatus comprising a plurality of switching devices and suitable for directly coupling two electric power devices. In direct couple control that directly couples a fuel cell (22) and motor (26) with a battery (24) without executing voltage-decreasing chopper control or voltage-increasing chopper control, rotation switching is performed, i.e. the converter controller (54) outputs drive signals (UH, VH, WH) of 100% duty ratio to each of upper arm devices (81u, 81v, 81w) in rotation. Thus, heat generation is prevented from concentrating on a particular upper arm device (81), compared to the case where the drive signals (UH, VH, WH) are continuously output to all upper arm devices (UH, VH, WH).
