abstract
    Provided are embodiments for a braking system, where the system includes a controller, a motor coupled to an H-bridge network, a DC link coupled to the motor, and an electrical braking system (100) electrically coupled to the motor. The electrical braking system (100) includes a sense circuit configured to sense a condition of the DC link, a brake resistor coupled to the DC link, a drive circuit coupled to the sense circuit, and a transformer for regeneration. Also, provided are embodiments of a method for operating an efficient regenerative resonance electrical braking system (100).
