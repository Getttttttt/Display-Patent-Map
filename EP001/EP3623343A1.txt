abstract
    A process for the synthesis of ammonia from a hydrocarbon feedstock, wherein the process includes reforming the hydrocarbon feedstock to produce a make-up gas and converting said make-up gas into ammonia, the process is performed in an ammonia synthesis plant requiring an electric power for operation and also requiring a start-up power (Ps) for start-up, wherein a first electric power (P1) is internally produced in the ammonia plant, and a second electric power (P2) is imported, wherein said second electric power is equal to or greater than said start-up power (Ps).
