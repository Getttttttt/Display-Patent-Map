abstract
    A two-wheeled electric vehicle includes a battery, a three-phase AC electric motor, a motor controller, an accelerator operator, and an accelerator operation detection means. The electric motor is arranged to generate a driving force to be transmitted to a drive wheel when a current is supplied from the battery and to generate a prescribed braking torque when coils of three phases are short-circuited. The motor controller includes a short-circuit control means for putting the electric motor in a short-circuited state in response to meeting of a short-circuiting condition, a release control means for releasing the short-circuited state in response to meeting of a release condition when the electric motor is in the short-circuited state, and a regeneration control means for executing a regeneration operation of supplying a regenerative current, generated by the electric motor, to the battery when the operation amount of the accelerator operator is zero. When the short-circuited state is released by the release control means, the regeneration control means controls the regenerative current so that the electric motor generates a braking torque equivalent to that in the three-phase short-circuited state.
