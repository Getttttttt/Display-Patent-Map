abstract
    A heat-exchange ventilation device including a heater connection terminal to which an external connection heater (8) that is installed in an outdoor air-supply duct connected on an outdoor side of an air supply passage and that heats a supply air flow flowing through the air supply passage into a heat exchanger is connected, a temperature sensor (6) that measures a temperature of a supply air flow passing through the air supply passage, and a control unit (22) that controls operations of an air supply fan (5) and an air exhaust fan (4) and turning-on and turning-off of the external connection heater (8) based on a measurement result of the temperature sensor (6), in which the air supply fan (5) is operable at a plurality of intensities at which different air volumes of the supply air flow are generated, and the control unit (22) prohibits a state in which the air supply fan (5) is operated at an intensity lower than an intensity set in advance and the external connection heater (8) is turned on.
