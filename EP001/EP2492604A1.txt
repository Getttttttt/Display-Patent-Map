abstract
    A ventilation unit (1) that comprises means (10) for the forced supply of air through a supply channel (7), and means (11) for the forced extraction of air through an exhaust channel (8), whereby the supply channel (7) and exhaust channel (8) are separate channels that are connected together in a heat-exchanging way by means of a heat exchanger (9), and in which a closable bypass channel (12) that bypasses the heat exchanger (9) is provided in the exhaust channel (8) or supply channel (7), whereby the ventilation unit (1) is provided with control means (13, 15) to regulate the temperature (T15) of the air supplied to the space according to a certain limit (Tg) by adjusting the flow resistance in the bypass channel (12).
