abstract
    A combined cycle power plant (10) is provided and includes a gas turbine engine (20) to generate power from combustion of a fuel and air mixture, a heat recovery steam generator HRSG (40) disposed downstream from the gas turbine engine (20) to receive heat energy from the gas turbine engine (20) from which steam is produced, the HRSG (40) including a superheating element (81) and a drum element (82), and a steam turbine engine (30) to be receptive of the steam produced in the HRSG (40) and to generate power from the received steam, the HRSG (40) further including a valve (80) operably disposed to isolate the superheating element (81) from the drum element (82) when a risk of condensate formation in the HRSG (40) exists.
