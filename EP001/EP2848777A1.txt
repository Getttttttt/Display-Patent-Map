abstract
    Preferred embodiments provide a system and method of generating steam comprising providing a continuous supply of coal (75), combusting the coal in a primary processing chamber (10) in the presence of oxygen (80) and water (85) to provide a first product gas stream (O), recovering heat from the first product gas stream in a first heat recovery steam generator (HRSG 20) to produce a first steam output (29), processing the first product gas stream in a secondary processing chamber (32) in the presence of oxygen (90) and water (86) to provide a second product gas stream (Q) substantially free of inorganic, organic and particulate contaminants, recovering heat from the second product gas stream in a second heat recovery steam generator (HRSG 40) to produce a second steam output (49), and combining the first steam output and the second steam output. In preferred embodiments, the combined steam output is used to drive a steam turbine (100).
