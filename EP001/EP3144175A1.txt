abstract
    The present invention relates to a method for controlling an electric vehicle (1), in particular a railway vehicle, having a three phase electric machine (7) for accelerating and/or decelerating the vehicle, the three phase electric machine includes a stator and a rotor, the method comprising the following steps: determining a current (I1) of a first phase of the three phase electric machine, determining a current (I2) of a second phase of the three phase electric machine, determining the angular position (p) of the rotor, and determining an estimated torque of the three phase electric machine based on the current of the first phase, the current of the second phase and the angular position of the rotor,controlling the electric vehicle based on the estimated torque..
