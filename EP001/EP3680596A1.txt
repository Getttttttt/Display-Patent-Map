abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a storage container (1) for a heat storage mass that is convertible from a solid to a liquid phase by adding heat and from a liquid to a solid state by releasing heat, wherein the storage container comprises an upper wall (3), a bottom wall (5) and a lateral wall (7) extending in between the upper and the bottom wall, heating means (11) that are switchable on and off and that are provided for converting the heat storage mass (13) in the storage container from the solid to the liquid phase by adding heat to the heat storage mass when the heating means are switched on, and from the liquid to the solid phase by cooling down the liquid heat storage mass when the heating means are switched off, wherein the heating means (11) are in the form of one or more electrical heating elements located at the inside of the storage container against the lateral wall thereof or inside the lateral wall (7) of the storage container.
