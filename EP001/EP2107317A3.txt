abstract
    An electric oven has an air passage structure that is designed to effectively cool down electric components. The air passage structure quickly cools down a variety of electric components on a top surface of a cavity using air introduced from outside the oven. The oven has a series of passages and openings allowing the effective movement of air past the electric components and through the oven.
