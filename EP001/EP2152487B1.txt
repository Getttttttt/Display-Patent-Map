abstract
    A method of recycling composite material comprising carbon fibers and a resin, the method comprising: providing a furnace comprising at least a heating portion; providing a transporter for transporting the composite material through the furnace; loading the composite material on the transporter and transporting the composite material through the furnace; detecting a percentage of oxygen in an atmosphere in the heating portion when the composite material has entered this portion; and removing resin from the composite material, as it travels through the heating portion of the furnace on the transporter, by means of chemical decomposition at a first temperature, with the resultant generation of fumes; wherein the generated fumes are removed from the heating portion in a controlled manner, such that the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere in the heating portion is controlled.
