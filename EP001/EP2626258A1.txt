abstract
    A motor controller unit facilitates modifying pressure thresholds for an air compressor motor in a hybrid commercial vehicle as a function of vehicle pitch and comprises a memory that stores computer-executable instructions for modifying compressor cut-in and cut-out pressure thresholds as a function of vehicle pitch, and a processor configured to execute the computer-executable instructions. The instructions comprise monitoring a pitch of the vehicle, and determining that the vehicle is on an uphill grade. The instructions further comprise reducing compressor cut-in and cut-out pressure thresholds for an on-board air compressor motor to conserve state-of-charge until the pitch of the vehicle falls below a predetermined level, and, once the pitch of the vehicle falls below a predetermined percentage of the maximum pitch detected on the uphill grade, increasing the compressor cut-in and cut-out pressure thresholds to increase available braking pressure and brake regeneration opportunities for the vehicle.
