abstract
    An air braking system for a vehicle blends regenerative and foundation braking during low deceleration conditions in an effective and controlled manner. The braking system also includes a mechanical override that bypasses system electronics in response to an aggressive brake request such that treadle circuit pressure is sent directly to a brake relay circuit to actuate vehicle brakes.
