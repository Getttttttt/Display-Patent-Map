abstract
    A waste heat recovery apparatus (1) includes an evaporator (10), an expander (18), a condenser (20), a liquid-phase refrigerant supply device (24), and a control device (70). The control device (70) is configured to control the liquid-phase refrigerant supply device (24) so as to bring the supply of a liquid-phase refrigerant by the liquid-phase refrigerant supply device (24) into a stopped state at least until an amount of the liquid-phase refrigerant stored in the evaporator (10) becomes equal to or lower than a predetermined low refrigerant amount, during operation of the internal combustion engine.
