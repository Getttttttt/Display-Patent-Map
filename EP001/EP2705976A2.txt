abstract
    An electric lawn tractor roll away prevention system includes a brushless DC electric motor powering a traction drive wheel on the electric lawn tractor. The motor is connected to phase wires and provides a back EMF voltage on the phase wires if the electric lawn tractor rolls and turns the traction drive wheel without electric power from the motor. A three phase inverter rectifies the back EMF voltage, turns on the traction controller if the rectified voltage reaches a pre-specified threshold, and applies a voltage to the phase wires to reduce the speed of the electric lawn tractor by regenerative braking.
