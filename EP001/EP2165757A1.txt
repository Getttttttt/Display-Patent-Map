abstract
    This invention relates to a method and appliance for carrying out exothermal chemical processes with efficient heat recovery. The recovered heat is utilized in Rankine power generation units to generate electric energy which is used to supply the electric energy demand of the exothermal chemical process, e.g. of pumps and cooling aggregates.
