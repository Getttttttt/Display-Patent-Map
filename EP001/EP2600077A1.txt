abstract
    The invention relates to a heating device for providing a heated liquid medium, comprising a burner for generating a heated combustion gas, wherein the burner is configured for receiving a burner signal. The heating device further comprises a heat exchanger comprising a tube having an inlet opening and an outlet opening. The outside of the tube defines a first heat exchange surface for contacting the combustion gas and the inside of the tube defining a second heat exchange surface for contacting the liquid medium. The heating device also comprises a fan for providing an airflow over the heat exchanger, wherein the fan is configured for receiving a fan signal and a pump for pumping the liquid medium into the inlet opening and out of the outlet opening. The pump is configured for receiving a pump signal. The heating device comprises a control unit configured for emitting the burner signal, the fan signal and the pump signal. The control unit is configured for controlling the burner, fan and pump by emitting the respective burner signal, fan signal and pump signal such that the combustion gas condenses on the first heat exchange surface for cleaning the first heat exchange surface by washing using the condensate. The invention further relates to a method for cleaning a heat exchanger in a heating device.
