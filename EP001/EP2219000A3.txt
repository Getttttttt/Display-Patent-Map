abstract
    The recuperator's section for the intake and exhaust ventilation centre. The section has an outlet opening and at least one inlet opening for fresh air (the openings are located on the same side of the vertical axis of the section) and an outlet opening and at least one inlet opening for exhaust air (the openings are located on the opposite side of the vertical axis of the section). The section has also the recuperator's plates positioned perpendicularly with regard to the longitudinal axis of the ventilation centre. The section is characterized by the following: It has at least one pair of segments (5) that are arranged parallely. The inlet-outlet openings of a pair of segments (5) are connected to the space of the lower collector (6) or the upper collector (7). The collectors (6 and 7) are frontally closed on one side. On the other side the collectors are connected through sleeves (12 and 13) with the openings in partitions (14 and 15) of section (1) while the spaces (19, 22), limited by external walls of section (1) and partition (20), form two collectors for the openings of segments (5) that are not housed by collectors (6) and (7). Additionally, each lower collector (6) is mounted on the frame with brackets (10) on which the lower, external edges of the external segments (5) are based.
