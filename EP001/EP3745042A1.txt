abstract
    Ventilation climate system for regulating a climate in a room of a building, in particular a residential building, comprising:- a return air system for guiding a flow of return air, comprising a return air inlet for taking in return air from the room, a return air outlet arranged outside of the room for expelling return air from the return air system;- a supply air system for guiding a flow of supply air, comprising a supply air inlet for taking in supply air from outside the room, a supply air outlet for supplying supply air into the room;- a heat exchange system arranged between the return and supply air systems for exchanging heat between the flow of return air and the flow of supply air;- a temperature adjustment unit comprising a heat transfer member for adjusting the temperature of the flow of supply air, wherein the heat transfer member is arranged in the supply air system between the supply air inlet and the supply air outlet and downstream of the heat exchange system.
