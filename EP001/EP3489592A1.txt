abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a filter contamination detection system (1) particularly for a ventilation system (2) and/or an air conditioner comprising: a housing (20) accommodating: a first air-filter (21), and a first fan (22) for inducing a first airflow through a first air passage (30), comprising an air inlet (31) and an air outlet (32), through the first air-filter (21), and a first fan motor (23) that drives the first fan (22), wherein a controller (40) is configured to determine a filter contamination state of the first air-filter (21) on the basis of:a) a fan motor power measurement and/or fan motor current measurement and/or fan motor resistance measurement during operation of the first fan motor (23) at a constant revolution speed or a constant DC voltage; orb) a fan motor power measurement and/or fan motor current measurement and/or fan motor resistance measurement and/or fan motor revolution speed measurement and/or DC voltage measurement during operation of the first fan motor (23) at a constant airflow rate; orc) a fan motor power measurement and/or fan motor current measurement and/or fan motor resistance measurement and/or fan motor revolution speed measurement and/or DC voltage measurement during operation of the first fan motor (23) at a constant airflow rate until a maximum revolution speed or a predetermined or a selected revolution speed or a maximum DC voltage or a predetermined DC voltage or a selected DC voltage is reached and then keep a constant revolution speed or a constant DC voltage; ord) an airflow rate measurement during operation of the first fan motor (23) at a constant revolution speed or a constant DC voltage.
