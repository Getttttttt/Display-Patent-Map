abstract
    A thermal energy recovery apparatus (1, 22, 31) comprises a thermal store (9, 29) containing phase change material (PCM). When the thermal energy recovery apparatus (1, 22, 31) is mounted to a motor vehicle, exhaust gases from its engine (2) are passed through channels (10, 30) in the thermal store (9, 29) and the PCM absorbs heat from the gases. Heat from the thermal store (9, 29) is subsequently recovered by passing a heat transfer fluid such as water through a jacket (13), enclosing the thermal store (9), and through ducts (16, 30) extending through the thermal store (9, 29). The heat transfer fluid may for example be used to provide heat for a domestic central heating or hot water system.
