abstract
    The present invention provides a Rankine cycle apparatus that is mounted in a vehicle and includes a Rankine cycle circuit and a refrigeration cycle circuit. The Rankine cycle circuit and the refrigeration cycle circuit each include a condenser for cooling a corresponding type of working fluid and a receiver, which is connected to the condenser. The two condensers are arranged side by side in the upward-downward direction and each have a first end and a second end in the vehicle width direction. A first receiver, which is one of the receivers, is arranged outward of the first end in the vehicle width direction. A second receiver, which is the other one of the receivers, is located outward of the second end in the vehicle width direction.
