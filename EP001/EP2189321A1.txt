abstract
    The traction driven AC electric motor (2) is connected to the electric accumulator (1) through at least one inverter (3, 13) for the conversion of DC electric current to AC electric current. In the event that the inverter (3) is bidirectional, it includes at least one primary inlet or outlet (6) connected to the electric accumulator (1), and at least one secondary inlet or outlet (7) which is connected to the traction driven AC electric motor (2). In the event that nonreversible inverters are utilized, the inlet of the primary inverter is connected to the electric accumulator (1) and the outlet of the primary inverter is connected to the traction driven AC electric motor (2) while the inlet of the secondary inverter is connected to the traction driven AC electric motor (2) and the outlet of the second inverter is connected to the electric accumulator (1). An additional advantage in this type of connection is the attachment of at least one diagnostic element (4) which as an option can be installed into at least one inverter (3). In the event that the diagnostic element (4) is not installed into the inverter, the primary inlet is connected to the electric accumulator (1) and the secondary inlet is connected to at least one inverter (3). The diagnostic element additionally includes an outlet (12) connected to a display and/or recording device (5). Another advantage is the attachment of at least one apparatus to the electric accumulator (1) for the purpose of cooling the traction driven AC electric motor and/or at least one inverter (3).
