abstract
    The present invention relates to a ventilation system for ventilating contaminated areas such as hospital or laboratory facilities, the ventilation system comprising an inlet ventilation duct comprising an inlet, an outlet and a first ventilator device, where the inlet ventilation duct is adapted to guide a flow of a clean air-mixture from the surroundings to the contaminated area, and where said flow is provided by the first ventilator device, an outlet ventilation duct comprising an inlet, an outlet and a second ventilator device, where the outlet ventilation duct is adapted to guide a flow of a contaminated air-mixture from the contaminated area to the surroundings, and where said flow is provided by the second ventilator device, where the inlet ventilation duct is sealed from the outlet ventilation duct to prevent a leak of the contaminated air-mixture from said outlet 2to said inlet ventilation duct, and where the ventilation system comprises a heat recovery unit for exchanging heat between the air-mixtures in the inlet and the outlet ventilation ducts, where the heat recovery unit comprises a heat exchanging unit and a heat pipe unit. The present invention further relates to a heat recovery unit for use in the ventilation system.
