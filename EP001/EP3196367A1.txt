abstract
    Disclosed is a hydraulic circuit for construction equipment for controlling to selectively supply a hydraulic oil from a hydraulic pump to a hydraulic cylinder for driving a boom. The hydraulic circuit for construction equipment, according to the present invention, comprises: a hydraulic cylinder driven by a hydraulic oil of a hydraulic pump; a direction control valve installed on the oil passage between the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic cylinder; an operating device installed on the oil passage between a pilot pump and the direction control valve; a center by-pass switching valve installed at the most downstream side of a center by-pass passage of the hydraulic pump; a pressure detection sensor that detects the pressure of a hydraulic oil at the large chamber side of the hydraulic cylinder; a jack-up switching valve installed on the oil passage between the operating device and the center by-pass switching valve; and a flow control valve installed in the spool of the direction control valve.
