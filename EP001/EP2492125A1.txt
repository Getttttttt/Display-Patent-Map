abstract
    The claimed innovation relates to an energy accumulator using compressed air for hybrid electric vehicles, which makes it possible to recover the electric energy generated from the vehicle kinetic energy, and store it using compressed air. This configuration increases the global efficiency, performance and operational reliability of the vehicle, reduces energy waste and ensures the availability and use of regenerating brakes in these conditions.
