abstract
    A heat exchanger (1) includes a heat exchanging body (20) disposed within an outer box (10). A supply pipe (21) and a discharge pipe (22) in fluid communication with the heat exchanging body (20) respectively extend through first and second insertion holes (31, 32) in the outer box (10). Elastic seal members (40; 240) are respectively provided around the supply pipe (21) and the discharge pipe (22) and between a first sidewall (11) of the outer box (10) and the heat exchanging body (20). At least one biasing member (50; 250) exerts a lateral biasing force (Fl; F2) on the elastic seal members (40; 240), thereby maintaining the elastic seal members (40; 240) in a state of compressive deformation and contacting the outer box (10) and the heat exchanging body (20) in an air-tight manner to block potential leakage paths (LP1; LP2) via the insertion holes (31, 32).
