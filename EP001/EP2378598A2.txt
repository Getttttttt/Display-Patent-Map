abstract
    The steam generator for a fuel cell with dual use for heating fuel electrode gas according to the invention is configured as a single unit comprising a steam generator (100) that heats introduced water to generate steam, a steam superheater (200) that is connected to the steam generator (100) and used to supply superheat to the steam in order to elevate the temperature of the steam, and a fuel electrode gas heater (300) that is used to supply heat to the fuel electrode gas in order to elevate the temperature of the fuel electrode gas. The steam generator (100), steam superheater (200) and fuel electrode gas heater (300) are connected with an air electrode exhaust gas flow path through which the air electrode exhaust gas passes, to receive heat supply through heat exchange.
