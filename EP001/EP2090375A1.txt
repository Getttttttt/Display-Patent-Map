abstract
    The present invention concerns a system for controlling at least thermally a booth. The energy recovery system (10) comprises: a first air treatment unit (20) arranged to take outside air and to introduce air that has been at least thermally controlled into the booth (12); a second air treatment unit (30) arranged to extract exhausted air from the booth (12); and heat exchanging means (43) configured to exchange heat between the exhausted air and the outside air to be introduced into the booth. The system further includes air humidifying means (45) arranged to humidify the exhausted air, to lower the predetermined temperature of the exhausted air by exploiting the evaporation enthalpy, and to introduce the humidified exhausted air into the heat exchanging means so as to optimise the energy recovery. The invention also concerns a unit for treating exhausted air and a method of controlling at least thermally a booth.
