abstract
    The present invention relates to building engineering and heating, plumbing, ventilation and electrical engineering and ventilation technology, and particularly to ventilation systems as well as heat recovery units for ventilation equipment. The ventilation equipment (6) according to the invention, which comprises a heat recovery unit, an outside air fitting (8), a supply air fitting, an extract air fitting (7) and an exhaust air fitting, is characterized in that the ventilation equipment (6) comprises a condensation element (11) arranged in connection with the extract air fitting (7), the condensation element (11) being hollow on the inside and appropriately arranged in an extract air chamber provided in connection with the extract air fitting (7) such that an outside air flow is supplied into the condensation element (11) from an outside air chamber provided in connection with the outside air fitting (8). Owing to the solution according to the invention, the heat recovery unit for ventilation equipment does not collect humidity and does not freeze.
