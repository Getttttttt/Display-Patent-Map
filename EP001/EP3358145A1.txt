abstract
    A method (100) includes determining, via a processor (39), a commanded temperature rate for a component of a steam turbine system (41). The method (100) further includes determining, via the processor (39), a measured temperature rate for the component of the steam turbine system (41). The method (100) additionally includes determining, via the processor (39), a variable multiplier based at least in part on the commanded temperature rate and the measured temperature rate. The method (100) also includes deriving, via the processor (39), a multiplied temperature rate command by applying the variable multiplier to the commanded temperature rate.
