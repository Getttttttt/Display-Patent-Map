abstract
    A self-charging type electromagnetic retarder having a main portion of the electromagnetic retarder consisting of a stator yoke, of a plurality of magnetic coils forming multi-phase connections, and of a steel rotor; a control device; an electric power generating type electromagnetic retarder potion having a driving device for a high revolution region consisting of transistors opened and closed by a drive pulse for the high revolution region issued from the control device, respectively; a capacitor portion storing therein an excess electric power; a diode for preventing a reverse-current; and a driving device for a low revolution region consisting of transistors opened and closed by a drive pulse for the low revolution region issued from the control circuit, respectively. The magnetic coils of each phase are connected with capacitors so as to form a resonance circuit, respectively. Each of the transistors for the high revolution region is connected in series to each of the multi-phase connections. Each of the transistors for the low revolution region is connected in series to each of the multi-phase connections through the capacitor portion and the diode. At the high revolution region, the excess electric power obtained from the electric power generating type electromagnetic retarder portion is stored in the capacitor portion, and at the low revolution region, the magnetic coils are excited by the electric power stored in the capacitor portion.
