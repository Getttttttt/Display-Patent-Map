abstract
    The present invention discloses a heat exchanger adapted for being used to heat domestic water and water for space heating. The heat exchanger includes a first passageway and a second passage way both disposed in the heat exchanger. The first passageway allows domestic water to pass therethrough and the second passageway allows water for space heating to pass therethrough. Wherein, one of the first and the second passageways is disposed in the other of the first and the second passageways. In this way, the heat exchanger has relatively simple structure and compact size.
