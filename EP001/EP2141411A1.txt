abstract
    The present invention is related to an evaporator section (3) in a steam generator comprising an inlet header (11), an outlet header (13), a plurality of heating tubes (12) connected in parallel at a first end to said inlet header (11) and at a second end to said outlet header (13), at least a feeder pipe (10) terminated by a feeder nozzle (14) connected to said inlet header (11) and a header distributor (16, 20) for conveying a biphasic fluid through the inlet header (11) from the feeder pipe (10), characterized in that said header distributor (16, 20) comprises means (17, 18, 19, 21) to perform an equalization of the biphasic fluid distribution inside said plurality of heating tubes (12).
