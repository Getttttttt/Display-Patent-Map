abstract
    A method for operating a steam power plant at low load is suggested comprising the extraction of live steam LS before the last superheater SH3 and/or resuperheated steam before the last resuperheater RSH2 and using the thermal energy of this steam in other heat sinks. Thus, nearly constant steam parameters of the live steam LS are achieved and the overall efficiency of the steam power plant remains at a high level.
