abstract
    A revolving drive device (60) comprises a revolving bearing (61) having an outer ring (61a) attached to a vehicle body frame (21) and an inner ring (61b) attached to a travel frame (11), the revolving bearing revolvably supporting the vehicle body frame (21); a first internal gear (62) provided integrally with an inner circumferential surface of the inner ring (61b); a ring-shaped member (63) fitted between the travel frame (11) and the inner ring (61b); a second internal gear (64) provided integrally in an inner circumferential surface of the ring-shaped member (63); a hydraulic revolution motor (65) having a first pinion (65a) attached to an output shaft and meshed with the first internal gear (62), the hydraulic revolution motor being supplied with operating oil and causing the first pinion (65a) to rotate, whereby revolving-drive force is provided to the vehicle body frame (21); and an electric revolution motor (66) having a second pinion (66a) attached to an output shaft and meshed with the second internal gear (64), the electric revolution motor being supplied with electric power and causing the second pinion (66a) to rotate, whereby revolving-drive force is provided to the vehicle body frame (21), and electric power is regenerated from the driven energy received by the vehicle body frame (21). The first internal gear (62) and the second internal gear (64) have different numbers of teeth.
