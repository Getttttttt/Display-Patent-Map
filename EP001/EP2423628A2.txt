abstract
    Heat exchanger comprising a membrane system defining a series of channels for the passage of air,whereby said membrane has a thickness of less than 1000µm, is(are) resistant to water and water vapor, and has(have) a multi-layered structure comprising :(a) a central core layer having a thermal conductivity of less than 0.50 W/(m.K) ;(b) a first outer coating layer, and(c) a second outer coating layer,whereby said outer coating layers are made of superhydrophobic material and a surface roughness having a root mean square surface roughness between 1.1µm and 20µm, and a Wenzel roughness factor above 1.2.
