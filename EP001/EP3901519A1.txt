abstract
    The present invention refers to a pyrolytic reactor intended for processing waste. This device has a particular interest for application in the recycling of plastic waste, from which the production of a liquid fuel is possible. The reactor (1) consists of a combustion chamber (2), burners (4) that burn gas to heat the pipes of the heat exchanger of the reactor (3) that pass through the reactor (1) at its full height and which are immersed in the fluidized bed (20) and on the freeboard (21). The reactor (1) also consists of a distribution plate (19) composed of a set of microperforated pipes for introducing gas into the fluidized bed (20), and of valves of the bed (16) for controlling the removal of the material of the fluidized bed (20).
