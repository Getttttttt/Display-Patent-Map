abstract
    Terminals of a battery apparatus is connected to terminals of a vehicle body controller, respectively, and terminals of the battery apparatus are connected to terminals of a charger, respectively. The terminals are connected to each other through a communication path, and the terminals are connected to each other through a communication path. A termination resistor and a switch are connected in series between the communication paths. A microcomputer controls the switch based on a voltage of the terminal.
