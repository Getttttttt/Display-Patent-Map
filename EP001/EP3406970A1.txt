abstract
    A shell-and-tube heat exchanger comprises a shell enclosing a plurality of U-shaped tubes. Each tube is provided with a first portion and with a second portion that are hydraulically connected by a U-bend. The open ends of each tube are connected to a tube-sheet and the tubes are vertically arranged and disposed downward with respect to the tube-sheet. The shell is provided with at least an inlet nozzle for inletting a first fluid and with at least an outlet nozzle for outletting the first fluid. A pressure chamber is connected to the tube-sheet on the opposite side of the shell and above the shell. The pressure chamber is provided with a plurality of nozzles for inletting and outletting at least a second fluid that flows under natural circulation within the tubes, to indirectly perform a heat exchange with the first fluid, and that vaporizes during the heat exchange. The pressure chamber contains a guiding jacket that, at a first end thereof, is sealingly joined to the tube-sheet or the first tube portions and, at a second end thereof that is opposite to the first end, is open. The guiding jacket splits the pressure chamber into a first section, that is enclosed by the guiding jacket and is in communication with the first tube portions, and a second section, that is in communication with the second tube portions. The first section and the second section are in communication each other by means of the open end of the guiding jacket. The first section is provided with a liquid level, located below the open end, and therefore with a vapour chamber, located above the liquid level.
