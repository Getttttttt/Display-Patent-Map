abstract
    The invention describes a combustion system for the flaring of waste gas. The system is comprising a combustion device (105), a heat exchanger (110) and a stack (115). The combustion device (105) is comprising a waste gas feed pipe (120), a support gas feed pipe (125), an air feed system (130), a mixing chamber (135) for mixing air with waste gas and/ or with support gas, and a gas permeable combustion surface (140) onto which the waste gas will be burnt after the premix has flown through it, thereby producing flue gas. The stack (115) connects the combustion device (105) to the heat exchanger (110), thereby creating flue gas flow from the combustion device (105) into the heat exchanger (110). The heat exchanger (110) comprises channels for the flue gas and for at least one fluid to be heated.
