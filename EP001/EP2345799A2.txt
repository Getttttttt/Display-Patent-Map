abstract
    A waste heat recovery system (10) includes at least two integrated rankine cycle systems (12, 14) coupled to at least two separate heat sources (18, 38, 40, 42, 44, 64, 78) having different temperatures. The first rankine cycle system (12) is coupled to a first heat source (18) and configured to circulate a first working fluid. The second rankine cycle system (14) is coupled to at least one second heat source and configured to circulate a second working fluid. The first and second working fluid are circulatable in heat exchange relationship through a cascading heat exchange unit (34) for condensation of the first working fluid in the first rankine cycle system (12) and evaporation of the second working fluid in the second rankine cycle system (14). At least one bypass unit (24, 58, 59, 65, 72, 80, 88, 96, 102, 108) is configured to divert at least a portion of the first working fluid to bypass the first evaporator (16), the first expander (30), the cascaded heat exchange unit (34), or combinations thereof; at least a portion of the second working fluid to bypass the second expander (46), the cascaded heat exchange unit (34), or combinations thereof.
