abstract
    A system and method of using the system includes an open-loop path (12) and a closed-loop path (14). The open-loop path is configured to extract bleed air from a compressor section of a gas turbine engine through a bleed air port and discharge bleed air to an ambient environment. The closed-loop path is configured to circulate a working fluid through a heat exchanger (24), a turbine (26), and a condenser (28) with a pump (30). The heat exchanger is fluidly coupled to the bleed air port and configured to extract heat from the bleed air to boil the working fluid for driving the turbine and a component rotationally coupled to the turbine.
