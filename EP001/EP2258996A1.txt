abstract
    In separating a blast furnace gas discharged from a blast furnace top into gases each containing a gas component as a main component by using two-stage gas separation/refinement apparatuses, a method for separating the blast furnace gas includes separating the blast furnace gas into a gas containing carbon dioxide and an unavoidable impurity gas component and a gas containing nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and an unavoidable impurity gas component by using a first stage gas separation/refinement apparatus (S1) and separating the gas containing nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and the unavoidable impurity gas component separated by using the first stage gas separation/refinement apparatus into a gas containing nitrogen and an unavoidable impurity gas component and a gas containing carbon monoxide and an unavoidable impurity gas component by using a second stage gas separation/refinement apparatus (S2).
