abstract
    The invention relates to power supply system (102) for a traction unit (100), the traction unit (100) having a transformer (104) for providing a transformer AC voltage from an electrical grid (107, 160) and a battery (110) for providing a battery DC voltage, the power supply system (102) comprising: a DC link (112) for providing a DC link voltage; a first converter (114) and a second converter (116) for converting at least one of the transformer AC voltage and the battery DC voltage into the DC link voltage, wherein each of the first converter (114) and the second converter (116) comprises at least two half bridges (200, 202) and wherein each of the half bridges (200, 202) is connected in parallel to the DC link (112); a first transformer terminal (122) and a second transformer terminal (126) for connecting each pole (120, 124) of a secondary coil (108) of the transformer (104) to a midpoint (208) of at least one of the half bridges (200, 202); a first battery terminal (130) for connecting a first pole (158) of the battery (110) to a midpoint (208) of at least one of the half bridges (200, 202); a second battery terminal (133) for connecting a second pole (132) of the battery (110) to the DC link (112); a switch (134) switchable between a first closed state and a second closed state, wherein the switch (134) connects a midpoint (208) of one of the half bridges (200, 202) either to one of the first transformer terminal (122) and the second transformer terminal (126) in the first closed state or to the first battery terminal (130) in the second closed state.
