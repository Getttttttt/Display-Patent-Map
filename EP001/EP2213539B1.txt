abstract
    A vehicle brake controller that suppresses variation in deceleration when there is a changeover between regenerative braking torque and frictional braking torque due to regeneration coordination control. A controller performs the function of correcting the assist driving force. More specifically, under regeneration coordination control, the larger the value of change in regenerative braking torque, the smaller the value of change in primary piston becomes with respect to the value of change in input rod stroke.
