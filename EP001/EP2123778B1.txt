abstract
    A dust discharging system for a blast furnace includes a dust collector (90) for collecting flue dust (907) from flue gas produced from the blast furnace, a first discharge conduit (903) connected to the dust collector (90), a separator (2) connected to the first discharge conduit (903) for separating residual flue gas present in the flue dust (907), and an airtight tank (3) disposed below the first discharge conduit (903) to receive the flue dust (907) in a dry state separated from the residual flue gas.
