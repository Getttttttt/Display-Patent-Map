abstract
    The present invention reveals a system that allow interchange and optimize thermic energy by means of which has the capability the extraction of the air proceeded from the outside environment or the dwelling inner zone, industrial installation, premises or similar, for an energy transfer to another flow by means of interchangers, the system comprises an air entrance (1) from the outside, air entrance from (2) the inner zone, outlet air (3) to the outside zone and outlet air (4) to the inner zone, an interchanger (5) where comes the input flows, an initial fan-interchanger set (7) that direct the inlet air from the outside to the interchanger mentioned (5), a second fan-interchanger set (6) that direct the dwelling inner air to the interchanger mentioned (5), an accumulator (8) that include a condenser in connection to the outlet air (3) and the means of conduction intro the system.
