abstract
    An integrated internal combustion engine and waste heat recovery system including an internal combustion engine, a system of exhaust gas conduits, a first heat exchanger in fluid communication with the exhaust gas conduits, a second heat exchanger in fluid communication with the exhaust gas conduits downstream of the first exchanger, a selective catalytic reduction unit positioned between the first and second heat exchangers, a waste heat recover system (WHR) and a mechanical connection. The WHR system includes a system of working fluid conduits in fluid communication with the first and second heat exchangers, an expander, a condenser, and a pump. The mechanical connection connects the internal combustion engine and the expander. The heat exchangers are configured to facilitate thermal communication between the working fluid and exhaust gas conduits. The working fluid and exhaust gas conduits include bypass conduits around the heat exchangers.
