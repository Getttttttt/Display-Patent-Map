abstract
    To provide a hybrid vehicle in which an electric motor is disposed in the vicinity of a center of a vehicle body to reduce lateral expansion.  The hybrid vehicle includes: an engine 5; a motor 6; and a power transmission mechanism 7 for transmitting powers of the engine 5 and the motor 6 to a rear wheel WR. The engine 5 is suspended on the vehicle body in a non-swingable manner, with a cylinder 54 extending in a substantially horizontal direction and a crankshaft 50 provided to be oriented in a vehicle width direction. Also, the motor 6 is located in front of and above the crankshaft 50 of the engine 5.
