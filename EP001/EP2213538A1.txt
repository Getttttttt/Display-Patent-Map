abstract
    A braking system for an aircraft (2) provided with undercarriage (7), wherein an axial-flux three-phase reversible electric machine (20) is set between the wheel (10) and frame (8) of the undercarriage; a three-phase rectifier diode bridge (28) is provided, connected at input to the windings (26a, 26b, 26c) of the axial-flux reversible electric machine (20) during rotation of said wheel (10) when the aircraft is landing, to provide a substantially levelled voltage (Vc) used for solenoids (54) for actuating a mechanical disk brake coupled to the wheel (10) and used for producing a braking effect in said landing phase.
