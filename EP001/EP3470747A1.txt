abstract
    An indirect evaporative cooling system includes a frame, a heat exchanger core, a supply fan to move indoor return air inside the heat exchanger core, and an outdoor exhaust fan supported by the frame to draw outdoor air over the heat exchanger core in a direction perpendicular to the indoor return air. The system further includes a water spray system positioned above the heat exchanger core to spray water over the heat exchanger core, and a water collection and management system disposed below the heat exchanger core to collect water sprayed onto the heat exchanger core. The water collection and management system includes a water basin configured to contain fluid. The water basin is configured to include an operational water volume and a water reserve volume which together define a total usable water volume, and includes a water height set point to define the water reserve volume.
