abstract
    A heat exchange device (10) for air cooling for conditioning and climate control systems for server rooms and the like, which comprises:- an air/air heat exchanger (11), designed to be passed through by a primary air stream (12) along a first trajectory (X) from an intake region (13) to an outflow region (14) and by a secondary air stream (33) along a second trajectory (Y) from a corresponding intake region (36) to a corresponding outflow region (37),- water dispensing means (15) adapted to wet the heat exchanger (11) downward from above,- means (16) of collecting the water that descends from the heat exchanger (11),- a recirculation pump (17) for returning the air-cooling water from the collection means up to the dispensing means arranged above the heat exchanger (11);the water dispensing means comprise a plurality of nozzles arranged side by side, or rows of nozzles (18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23), which are adapted to dispense water with a flow-rate that decreases starting from the intake region (13) for the primary air stream (12) toward the outflow region (14) of the heat exchanger (11).
