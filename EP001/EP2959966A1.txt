abstract
    A method for calcination of a carbon dioxide rich sorbent (containing CaCO3) comprises combusting in a furnace (2) a fuel with an oxidizer, supplying heat transfer (HT) solids into the furnace (2) and heating them, transferring the HT solid particles from the furnace (2) to a reactor (3) having a rotatable container (51), supplying a carbon dioxide rich solid sorbent (containing CaCO3) into the rotatable container (51), rotating the rotatable container (51) for mixing the solid particles and the carbon dioxide rich solid sorbent for transferring heat from the solid particles to the carbon dioxide rich solid sorbent and generating carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide lean solid sorbent (mainly CaO), discharging the carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide lean solid sorbent from the rotatable container (51) and the subsequent classification of the HT solids from the lean sorbent.
