abstract
    The present invention relates to an air conditioner (1) configured to be installed in a ceiling space, in the space between a drop ceiling and the actual ceiling. The air conditioner (1) is configured to be inspected and serviced from below in such a way that:- on the lower side of the housing (10) is a service hatch (11) which is arranged to open from below such that the fan (22) of the fresh air duct and the fan (32) of the exhaust air duct are in compartments (16) behind the service hatch (10) and from which compartments (16) the filters (21, 31) of the exhaust air duct (3) and the fresh air duct (2) are further accessible,- inside the housing (10), below the outlet of the exhaust air duct (3) of the cross-counter-flow heat exchanger (4), is arranged a water trough (5) fixedly coupled to the housing (10), into which the condensate water (50) accumulating due to the condensation of the moisture contained in the air discharged outdoors from indoors flows and can be further discharged from the water trough (5), along a discharge pipe (51), out of the housing (10).
