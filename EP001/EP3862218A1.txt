abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a dual battery system (1) comprising a first battery (B1) and a second battery (B2), for balancing charge level of the first battery and the second battery, the dual battery system being adapted for powering propulsion of an electric vehicle (3) comprising a first electric motor (El) coupled in driving relationship with one or more rear wheels of the electric vehicle and a second electric motor (E2) coupled in driving relationship with one or more front wheels of the electric vehicle. The first battery is adapted to provide electric power for driving the first electric motor and the second battery is adapted to provide electric power for driving the second electric motor. The dual battery system obtains (100) at least one of data or information of a predetermined and/or imminent charging event of the electric vehicle. The dual battery system furthermore obtains (200) at least one of data or information of charge level of the first battery and second battery respectively. Moreover the dual battery system selects (300), when the charge level of the first battery and the second battery are unbalanced, a driving scenario which comprises charging and/or discharging of at least one of the first battery and the second battery, the driving scenario balancing the charge level of the first battery and the second battery prior to arriving at the predetermined and/or imminent charging event.
