abstract
    A balanced heat recovery unit that includes differential pressure sensors (Sen1, Sen2) that determine the pressure drop in the exchanger (Exch) for each one of the channels (Supply) (Exhaust) of the device, and based on a value matrix that it establishes as a function of the differential pressure and of the turbine rotation speed (Turb1, Turb2) corresponding to the airflow that circulates through each channel, for a specific type of heat recovery unit, determines the airflow that passes through each channel and based on the same automatically carries out the balancing of the installation.
