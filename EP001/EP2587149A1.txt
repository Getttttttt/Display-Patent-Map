abstract
    The invention consists of a process for the reduction of the NOx content in the exit gases from a rotary combustion furnace, which has a tubular body (2) at one of the ends whereof (3) a heat source (4) is located and at the opposite end whereof (5) the exit gases (6) are evacuated. The process comprises the launching of a bullet (7) comprising ammonia from one end (3, 5) of the tubular body (2) to a target area (8) located between both ends (3, 5) of the tubular body (2), wherein the operating combustion temperature of the furnace is between 800ºC and 1100ºC, such that the bullet (7) breaks down into at least ammonia, which reacts with the combustion gases, thereby reducing the NOx content in the exit gases (6) from the rotary furnace (1).
