abstract
    A compact two-stage evaporator waste heat recovery (WHR) device (7) is disclosed, and a system using the device. The device recovers energy from waste heat passing through the device and transfers that energy to a Rankine Cycle working fluid also passing through the device. The device includes a first and second evaporator (15); and, a state separator (17) connected between the outlet of the first evaporator and the inlet of the second evaporator. The state separator (17) separates the working fluid into liquid and vapor. The liquid is re-cycled to the inlet of the first evaporator (15); the vapor is sent to the inlet of the second evaporator (19) for superheating. An overall WHR system using the device further includes an expander (21), condenser (23), and pump (25). The system further includes control circuitry (26) for controlling operation of the waste heat recovery device (7) itself and the WHR system.
