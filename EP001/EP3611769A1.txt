abstract
    The disclosure includes a system and method thereof that implements the recovery of heat from a variable thermal load application and the delivery and spreading of this heat at a controllable temperature range to the target application such as a thermoelectric generator. The disclosure comprises a heat spreader (3) located between a hot source heat exchanger (4) and a target application (2) which uses liquid-vapour phase change to lower temperature and spread heat along the target application (2) avoiding the risk of overheating under high loads and thermal dilution under low loads. This effect is obtained by embedding variable conductance heat pipes, thermosiphons or vapour chambers in the spreader (3), within the heat path which absorb the heat by vaporization whenever this heat is above the phase change temperature. This phase change temperature is regulated via the inclusion of a non-condensable gas inside the chambers of the heat spreader. The disclosure can be fitted into an automobile exhaust pipe or adapted for industrial processes that produce a usable heat flow to be used as inlet flow (7) to the system. The disclosure is especially suitable for applications involving thermoelectric modules for electrical production in automobiles or in stationary applications with variable thermal load and in general applications which require temperature stability.
