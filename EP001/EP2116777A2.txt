abstract
    Many dwellings use condensing boilers as their source of heating and domestic hot water because such boilers offer increased efficiency when compared to non-condensing boilers. The operation of a condensing boiler is well known and need not be described in detail here. However, by way of a reminder, a condensing boiler seeks to cool the gas produced from its burner portion to below the dew point such that water vapour in the heated gas starts to condense thereby giving up its latent heat of vaporisation. In practise this means seeking to cool the flue gas to below 58°C or thereabouts. The condensate, which still has a temperature of around 57°C or 58°C is then ducted along a drain path and expelled. The present invention relates to a condensate heat exchanger for use with a condensing boiler, characterised by a heat exchanger being placed in a condensate drain path for draining condensate from the boiler.
