abstract
    A casing for an air supply fan is divided into a casing (301) and a casing (302), and a casing for an exhaust fan is divided into a casing (401) and a casing (402). The casing (301) and the casing (401) have the same shape and so do the casing (302) and the casing (402). A projection (302a) provided on the casing (302) and a projection (402a) provided on the casing (402) are superposed over each other with opposed principal surfaces thereof in surface contact with each other.
