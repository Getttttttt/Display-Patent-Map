abstract
    An exemplary rotorcraft (10) includes a propulsion system (22) including a prime mover (26) and a drive shaft (32) coupled to the prime mover (26), the drive shaft (32) including a coupling (36) separating the drive shaft (32) into an input shaft (38) and an output shaft (40), the coupling (36) operable between an engaged position rotationally coupling the input shaft and the output shaft and a disengaged position rotationally disengaging the output shaft from the input shaft, a main rotor (18) coupled to the prime mover, a secondary rotor (18') attached to the output shaft, and a motor (56) coupled to the output shaft.
