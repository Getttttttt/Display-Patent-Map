abstract
    A biomass power production system (1) comprising: a fuel preparation part (2) for receiving biomass fuel in solid form comprising: a drying apparatus (5) using hot air for reducing moisture in the biomass fuel, and a grinding apparatus (6) for pulverizing or grinding the biomass fuel into a pulverized biomass fuel, and an energy production part (3) comprising: a pulverized fired boiler (15) for receiving the pulverized biomass and generating thermal energy by burning the pulverized biomass where the thermal energy is in the form of pressurized steam, a steam turbine for converting the thermal energy of the pressurized steam into mechanical energy and where the steam turbine is adapted to drive an electrical generator (19) to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy, a flue gas cooler (20) adapted for receiving an exhaust gas from the boiler and extracting thermal energy from the exhaust gas for reducing the temperature of the exhaust gas, wherein the thermal energy generated in energy production part is converted into thermal energy for heating up the hot air of the drying apparatus (5).
