abstract
    An example of an apparatus is disclosed comprising an energy source 102, a first motor 106, a second motor and a control system. The first motor 106 is configured to drive a first load 103 and the second motor is configured to drive a second load. The control system is coupled to the energy source 102, the first and the second motors. The control system dumps the braking power generated by the first load 103 at least partially on the first motor 106 according to a first braking command. The control system dumps the braking power generated by the second load at least partially on the second motor, according to a second braking command. Also disclosed are other varieties of apparatuses, vehicles, such as electric tractors, electric forklifts and relative methods, etc.
