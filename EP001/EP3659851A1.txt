abstract
    The invention concerns a control unit (1) for controlling a braking system in a recuperation mode of a driving vehicle (30), which is adapted to control the braking power of a first braking means (3) set up as a recuperating generator and the braking power of a second braking means (4) set up as a mechanical brake by the use of at least one physical parameter being effective during the driving operation, in order to distribute the total braking power between the first braking means (3) and the second braking means (4) and thus adjusting the proportionate braking power of the two braking means (3,4) to the total braking power.The invention also concerns a vehicle comprising a control unit, a method of operating the vehicle and the use of the control unit.
