abstract
    The present invention relates to a heat recovery unit for controlled mechanical ventilation systems formed by a casing (1) internally housing a heat exchanger and having at the ends openings (9) between which two circulation circuits for the circulation of airflows are established which are connected to but not mixed with one another in the heat exchanger, in each of the openings (9) the casing (1) having housings (8) which open to the exterior, where air cleaning filters can be inserted and removed, allowing selectively determining the openings (9) intended for acting as the inlets of the inner circulation circuits for the circulation of airflows passing through the heat exchanger.
