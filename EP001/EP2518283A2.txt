abstract
    An expansion system is presented. including a pump (106) configured to pressurize a condensed working fluid received from a condenser (108). The expansion system further includes a heat exchanger coupled to the pump and configured to vaporize the condensed working fluid received from the pump. The expansion system also includes an expander (112) coupled to the heat exchanger and configured to expand the vaporized working fluid flowing from an inlet side of the expander to an outlet side of the expander. In addition, the expansion system includes a generator (114) coupled to the expander (112) and configured to generate energy in response to the expansion of the vaporized working fluid. Further, the expansion system includes an integrated cooling unit (122) configured to convey at least a portion of the condensed working fluid from an inlet side of the generator (114) to an outlet side of the generator (114) to dissipate heat generated by the generator.
