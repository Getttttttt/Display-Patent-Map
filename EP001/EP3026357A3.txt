abstract
    The invention provides system for cooling a space. The system comprises a housing with an external inlet, an external outlet, an internal inlet, an internal outlet, and is configurable to provide a first flow passage for conducting air between the external inlet and the internal outlet and to provide, a second flow passage for conducting air between the external inlet and the external outlet, and a third flow passage for conducting air between the internal inlet and the internal outlet. The internal outlet comprises means for generating a laminar airflow at the internal outlet.
