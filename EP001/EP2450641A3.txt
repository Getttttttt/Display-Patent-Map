abstract
    The invention regards a building (1), which comprises several rooms divided over at least one floor with a hydronic heating system. The building further comprises one or more supply air members (5) for supply of air, one or more exhaust air channels (6) for collection and removal of exhaust air, an outgoing air channel (7) for removal of the collected exhaust air. The building has a heat recovery installation (9), which includes a heat pump (3) that comprises an evaporator (10), a condenser (11), a first fan (12), and at least one compressor (13), and a water conduit (2). The heat recovery installation is placed at least above said floor. The invention further regards a heat recovery installation that comprises a common outgoing air chamber (14) into which the exhaust air channel leads and from which the second fan (8) removes the exhaust air via the outgoing air channel, whereby the heat pump is arranged such that the exhaust air that passes the evaporator is led from and to the outgoing air chamber.
