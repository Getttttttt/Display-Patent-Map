abstract
    A valve assembly (10) is provided. The valve assembly includes a valve body (12) defining a bore (14). The valve assembly further includes a pull rod (20) disposed in the bore and defining a bolt cavity (26). The pull rod is moveable between a first pull rod position and a second pull rod position. The valve assembly further includes a bolt (48) disposed in the bolt cavity and moveable with respect to the pull rod between a first bolt position and a second bolt position. The valve assembly further includes a spool (66) disposed in the bore. The spool is operatively coupled to the pull rod to move between an energized position and a neutral position.
