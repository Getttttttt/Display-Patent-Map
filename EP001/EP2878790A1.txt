abstract
    One of the objects of the invention is to provide a water-saving type advanced humid air gas turbine system (AHAT) that can decrease the amount of makeup water to be supplied from the outside, by reducing the amount of water consumed when the gas turbine system is starting up, shut down, or subjected to load rejection.
