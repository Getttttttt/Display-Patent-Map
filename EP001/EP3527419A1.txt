abstract
    A management of the operation of automotive dual battery electrical system in which the automotive electronic control unit (ECU) is configured to:- determine the current operation status of an automotive dual battery electrical system (DBES) defined by the current electric charge statuses of a main electrical energy source (MB) and of an auxiliary electrical energy source (AB) and by the current electrical energy demand of electrical loads (L),- determining which operation area of an operation plane of the automotive dual battery electrical system (DBES) the current operation status of the automotive dual battery electrical system (DBES) belongs to, and- control the operation of the automotive dual battery electrical system (DBES), and enable or disable the implementation of one or more of the functionalities of automatic start and stop of the internal combustion engine (ICE), of regenerative braking and of electric charging depending on the operation area which the current operation status of the automotive dual battery electrical system (DBES) belongs to.
