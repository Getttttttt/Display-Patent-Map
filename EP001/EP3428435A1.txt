abstract
    There is provided an actuator (100) for an aircraft thrust reverser, comprising a first member (102), a second member (130) movable relative to the first member (102), a third member (150) movable relative to the first member (102) and the second member (130), and a lock system (200) configured to selectively lock the second member (130) to the third member (150) in a first stage of actuation, and the first member (102) to the second member (130) in a second, separate stage of actuation.
