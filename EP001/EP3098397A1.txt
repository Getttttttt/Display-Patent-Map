abstract
    The invention relates to power plant with a steam water power cycle and a lignite dryer that uses steam from the steam water power cycle. The connection of the lignite dryer to the steam water powercycle includes a first extraction line (104) and a second extraction line (101). The first extraction line (104) originates from a point between a high pressure turbine (32) and an intermediate pressure steam turbine (34) and includes an ejector (106), while the a second extraction line (101) originates from a point an intermediate pressure steam turbine (34) and a low pressure steam turbine (35). The configuration and location of the ejector (106) and the connection of the second extraction line (101) to the ejector (106) enables a lower pressure steam in the second extraction line (101) to be fed into the heater (13) together with a higher pressure steam of the first extraction line (104).
