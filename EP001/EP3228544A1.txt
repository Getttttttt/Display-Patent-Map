abstract
    A hybrid-electric propulsion system (10) includes a gas turbine engine (12), an electric machine (14) coupled to and rotatably driven by the gas turbine engine to produce AC electric power, an energy storage system (18), and a propulsion unit (16). The gas turbine engine includes a combustor (26) and a recuperator (20) that places an exhaust air flow that is downstream from the combustor in a heat exchange relationship with a compressed air flow that is upstream from the combustor to transfer thermal energy from the exhaust flow to the compressed flow. The propulsion unit includes a fan (44) and an electric motor (42) rotably coupled to the fan, the electric motor being driven by electric power from one of the electric machine or the energy storage system.
