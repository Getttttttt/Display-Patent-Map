abstract
    A front drivetrain (10) capable of providing all-wheel drive to a rear-wheel drive architecture. The front drivetrain (10) is coupled to the front end of the crank shaft (C) and includes a power-split planetary gear arrangement (12) that couples an electric machine (14) to the front drivetrain (10). In one embodiment, the planetary gear arrangement (12) includes a sun gear (24) coupled to the crank shaft (C), a planetary gear set (26) with a carrier (28) coupled to the driveshaft (16), a ring gear (32) coupled to the electric machine (14). The driveshaft (16) may be connected to left and right front axles (20, 22)by a bevel gear set (18) and a differential. In an alternative embodiment, sun gear (24) may be coupled to the electric machine (14) and the ring gear (32) can be coupled to the crank shaft (C). In this alternative embodiment, the planetary gear set (26) remain coupled to the driveshaft (16).
