abstract
    An electrolyzer converts brackish water to hydrogen and oxygen which are utilized in the multiple cylinder IC engine to reduce the amount of diesel utilized in the power plant. This improves emissions and reduces energy cost of operating the engine. Storage tanks for the oxygen and hydrogen are embedded in the diesel fuel tank to provide dual-walled protection for enhanced security and safety in transporting and storing the hydrogen. Possible energy sources for powering the electrolyzer include third rail technology, multiple unit (MU) jumper cables attached to power sources in refueling stations, a solar collector array, and traction motors associated with a dynamic brake system for the vehicle.
