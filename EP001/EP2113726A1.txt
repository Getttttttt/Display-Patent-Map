abstract
    An arrangement for ventilating one or more rooms in a building comprises a casing (7) having at least four openings arranged on the same side (12) thereof for conducting exhaust air from the rooms of the building as well as supply air from the exterior to said rooms of the building through a rotary heat exchanger (26) arranged inside said casing. Fan members (21, 23) are arranged inside said casing for creating air flows through the casing. The impeller of at least one of said fan members has blades curved backwards with respect to the rotation direction of the impeller.
