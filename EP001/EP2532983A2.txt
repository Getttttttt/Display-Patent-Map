abstract
    Disclosed are a heat pump boiler and a control method for the same. The heat pump boiler includes an outdoor unit having an outdoor-unit heat-exchanger, a water pipe including a water-feed pipe and a water-return pipe connected to the outdoor unit to feed water to the outdoor unit or to return low-temperature or medium-temperature water produced in the outdoor unit to an external location, heat exchangers connected to the water pipe to produce medium-temperature or high-temperature water, a variable-capacity compressor connected to the heat exchangers, a buffer tank connected to the water pipe, and an externally-wound heat exchanger to collect waste heat radiated from the compressor. A temperature of water stored in the buffer tank is raised using the collected waste heat, and, during a defrosting operation, the water stored in the buffer tank is fed to the outdoor-unit heat-exchanger to defrost an evaporator of the outdoor unit.
