abstract
    An EHC (140) is configured to electrically heat a catalyst that purifies exhaust gas from an exhaust path of an internal combustion engine mounted on an electrically-powered vehicle, when a current passes through the EHC (140). A charger (120) converts AC electric power supplied from an external power supply (210) to a charging port into charging power of a power storage device (70) by a power conversion path including an insulating transformer (330). The EHC (140) is electrically connected to power lines (352p, 352g) which are provided on the primary side of the insulating transformer (330) on the power conversion path, and to which a DC voltage is output. In a case where the EHC (140) is operated when the vehicle travels, the charger (120) converts the electric power from the power storage device (70) into the DC voltage output to the power lines (352p, 352g) connected to the EHC (140), by a part of inverse conversion of power conversion at the time of external charging.
