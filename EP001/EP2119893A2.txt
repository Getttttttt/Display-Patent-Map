abstract
    An integrated heat exchanger assembly for a gas turbine engine includes a first flow path, a second flow path, and a third flow path. The first flow path is configured to be coupled to a compressor and a combustor, to receive compressed air from the compressor, and to supply the compressed air to the combustor. The second flow path is configured to be coupled to the compressor or the first flow path, or both, to receive compressed air therefrom, and to be coupled to the combustor and to supply compressed air thereto. The third flow path is disposed adjacent to the first and second flow paths, and is configured to be coupled to an exhaust section, to receive exhaust air therefrom, and to allow heat transfer from the exhaust air in the third flow path to the compressed air in the first and second flow paths.
