abstract
    To provide a ventilation device having superior reliability. An air conditioning system (1) ventilates an indoor space (SI) that is a target space. The air conditioning system (1) is equipped with a supply air fan (21), an exhaust air fan (22), and a controller (6). The supply air fan (21) takes inside the indoor space (SI) outside air (OA) that is air of an outdoor space (SO). The exhaust air fan (22) exhausts to the outdoor space (SO) room air (RA) that is air inside the indoor space (SI). The controller (6) controls the operation of the supply air fan (21) and the exhaust air fan (22). In a case where a first fan that is either one fan among the supply air fan (21) and the exhaust air fan (22) has abnormally stopped, the controller (6) continues the operation of a second fan that is the remaining fan excluding the abnormally stopped first fan from the supply air fan (21) and the exhaust air fan (22) in order to make negative pressure or positive pressure inside the indoor space (SI).
