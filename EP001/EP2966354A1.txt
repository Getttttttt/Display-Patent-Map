abstract
    Method for operating a gas burner (10), wherein during burner-on phases a gas/air mixture having a defined mixing ratio of gas and air is provided to a burner chamber (11) of the gas burner (10) for combusting the gas/air mixture within the burner chamber (11), wherein the gas/air mixture is provided by mixing an air flow sucked in by a fan (14) with a gas flow, wherein the defined mixing ratio of the gas/air mixture is controlled by comparing an actual value of a signal provided by an electrical or electronic sensor (23) coupled to a gas duct (16) with a nominal value for the signal provided by the electrical or electronic sensor (23) and by generating a control variable for a gas valve (17) assigned to the gas duct (16) on basis of the control deviation between the actual value and the nominal value, wherein the actual value provided by the electrical or electronic sensor (23) corresponds to a pressure ratio between the gas pressure in the gas duct (16) and the air pressure at a reference point (24), and wherein when during burner-on phases the fan (14) is operated with constant fan speed and when further while the fan (14) is operated with constant fan speed a defined change of the control variable for a gas valve (17) is detected which is required to keep the actual value of the signal provided by the electrical or electronic sensor (23) at the nominal value for the same, it is detected that a siphon (28) assigned to burner chamber (11) of the gas burner (10) is blown empty.
