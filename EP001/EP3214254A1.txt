abstract
    For the achievement of ventilation with a quieter operating sound and/or for the achievement of a greater air flow volume per a unit of time of a ventilation device (100), a ventilation device (100) is proposed, where the fresh air duct (65, 62A, 68) and the exhaust air duct (66, 62B, 69) have been arranged to run in the first vertical direction side by side without crossing each other, first in the first direction against each other and then after a bend (34, 35) in the opposite vertical direction still against each other, ending up in a counter flow heat exchanger (62), where the inlet and outlet of the fresh air duct (62A) of the counter flow heat exchanger and of the exhaust air duct (62B) of the counter flow heat exchanger are at the opposite ends of the counter flow heat exchanger (62) mutually on the same side, in which case the crossing of the fresh air duct (65, 62A, 68) and the exhaust air duct (66, 62B, 69) with each other on the outside of the counter flow heat exchanger (62) is avoidable. Also contains an independent claim for a ventilation window.
