abstract
    This tower type boiler (1) includes: a furnace wall (3) that forms a boiler main body (2) and that performs a heat exchange with combustion gas (G) that is generated inside this boiler main body (2) ; and a heat transfer section that is positioned at a top portion the boiler main body (2) and that performs a heat exchange with the combustion gas (G) that is generated within the boiler main body (2). The heat transfer section is provided with a plurality of superheaters (6∼8), and an adjacent pitch (Pw) between heat transfer pipes in at least those superheaters (6, 7) from among the plurality of superheaters (6∼8) that are located closest to the furnace wall bottom portion (3a) is set wider than an adjacent pitch (Pn) between heat transfer pipes (11) in that superheater (8) that is located furthest away from the furnace wall bottom portion (3a).
