abstract
    A ventilation unit for a building has an inlet (26) for air drawn from the building and to be recirculated to the building, an inlet for external air (12) drawn from externally of the building; and a mixing zone (5) for mixing of the external air and the air drawn from the building. The unit also includes an air distribution outlet arrangement (30) for distribution of air to different zones internally of the building, and an air temperature control system providing airflows of different temperatures to be distributed via the distribution outlet arrangement to the different zones internally of the building.
