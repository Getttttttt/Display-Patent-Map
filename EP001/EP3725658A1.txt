abstract
    The electric bicycle (100) has an electric engine (140) powered by an electric accumulator (150), and moreover comprises: a frame (110), a front wheel (120), a rear wheel (130), an electromagnetic assembly (160) with at least one electromagnet, and an electric converter (170) electrically connected to the electromagnetic assembly (160) and to the electric accumulator (150) such as to be able to charge the electric accumulator thanks to electric energy received from the electromagnetic assembly (160); at least one of the two wheels (120, 130) comprises a plurality of magnets (137); the electromagnet (160) is fixed or bound to the frame (110) and it is positioned such as to magnetically interact with the plurality of magnets (137); an electronic control unit (190) is adapted for controlling an electric actuator such as to regulate the magnetic interaction between the electromagnet and the plurality of magnets (137).
