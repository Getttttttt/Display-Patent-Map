abstract
    An object of the present invention is to provide an exhaust heat recovery system for suitably circulating refrigerants in an intermediate heat exchanger at the start of an exhaust heat recovery operation, and a method for operating the exhaust heat recovery system. There is provided an air-conditioning and hot water supply system 1 along with a method for operating the system 1 in which an air-conditioning refrigerant circuit 3 and a hot-water-supply refrigerant circuit 2 are thermally connected with each other via an intermediate heat exchanger 11; the air-conditioning refrigerant circuit 3 is equipped with a heat exchanger 32 on the air-conditioning heat source side arranged in parallel with the intermediate heat exchanger 11; and the hot-water-supply refrigerant circuit 2 is furnished with a heat exchanger 22 on the hot-water-supply use side arranged in parallel with the intermediate heat exchanger 11. At the start of an exhaust heat recovery operation in which the air-conditioning refrigerant circulating in the air-conditioning refrigerant circuit 3 releases the heat absorbed from an air-conditioning hot and cold water circuit 5 into the hot-water-supply refrigerant circulating in the hot-water-supply refrigerant circuit 2 via the intermediate heat exchanger 11, the inflow of the air-conditioning refrigerant into the heat exchanger 32 on the air-conditioning heat source side and the inflow of the hot-water-supply refrigerant into the heat exchanger 22 on the hot-water-supply use side are limited.
