abstract
    A device for controlling a steam turbine and a combined cycle plant bypass system thereof includes: an acquisition module (9), for acquiring operating quantities measurements (QHP, PHP) of a combined cycle plant (1) including a gas turbine (2) and a steam turbine (3); a plurality of calculation modules (36-45), configured to determine, according to corresponding control modes, at least a first pressure set point (PHPCV) for a regulator (30) of a high-pressure inlet valve (27a) and a second pressure set point (PHPBP) for a regulator (30) of a high-pressure bypass valve (28a) of a high-pressure section (12) of the steam turbine (3); a supervisor module (35), configured to detect an operating condition of the plant (1) on the basis of the operating quantities (QHP, PHP) acquired by the acquisition module (9) and to selectively activate one of the calculation modules (36-45) in response to the detected operating condition.
