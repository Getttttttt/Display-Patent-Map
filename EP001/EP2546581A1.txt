abstract
    The invention relates to an air treatment system (1) and to a method of controlling it. The system (1) comprises a heat exchanger (10), which is divided into a supply air section (12) and an exhaust air section (11), and a bypass (13), that bypasses the supply air section (12). Upstream of the supply air section (12) a damper device (20) is arranged, which is divided into at least three individually controllable portions (21-23), of which a first portion (21) is adapted to totally stop an inflow of supply air (I) into the bypass (13), to allow a predetermined throttled inflow of supply air (I) into the bypass (13) or to allow an unthrottled inflow of supply air (I) into the bypass (13), a second portion (22) is adapted to totally stop an inflow of supply air (I) into a first half of the supply air section (12) of the heat exchanger (10) or to allow an unthrottled inflow of supply air (I) into the said first half, and a third portion (23) is adapted to totally stop an inflow of supply air (I) into a second half of the supply air section (12) of the heat exchanger (10) or to allow an unthrottled inflow of supply air (I) into said second half.
