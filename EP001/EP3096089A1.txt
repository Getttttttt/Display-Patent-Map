abstract
    The invention relates to a system for controlling the energy balance of a property, comprising an exhaust air duct (1) from the property to the control system, an outflow duct (2) from the control system, an inflow duct (3) to the control system and a supply air duct (4) to the property from the control system. According to the invention the control system comprises a liquid-filled heat storage tank (5). In addition, connected to the heat storage tank there is a compressor (6) including a first heat exchanger (7) disposed between the exhaust air duct (1) and the outflow duct (2) and a second heat exchanger (8) disposed between the inflow duct (3) and the supply air duct (4) for cooling the air flows and recovering heat into the heat storage tank. A heat transfer device (9) is also provided in the exhaust air flow downstream of heat exchanger (7) and in the supply air flow upstream of heat exchanger (8) for transferring heat from the exhaust air flow to the supply air flow. In addition, an additional heater (10) is provided downstream of the second heat exchanger (8) of the compressor (6) in the supply air duct (4) for adjusting the temperature of the supply air flow to be conveyed to the property.
