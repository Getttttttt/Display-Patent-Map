abstract
    The invention relates to a device for dual temperature heating and air conditioning, which comprises a casing (1) with at least one air inlet (2) and at least two air outlets (3, 4), whereby at least one heat exchanger (5) is arranged in the inner space of the casing (2) in the way of the air. The air outlets (3, 4) are divided into two groups arranged in the path of the air behind the heat exchanger (5), whereby in the casing (1) is swingingly arranged between two positions a switching flap (6), which in one position blocks the direct path of the air between the air inlet (2) and the other group of outlets (4) outside the heat exchanger (5) and at the same time opens a path for the air stream between the heat exchanger (5) and the second group of outlets (4), whereby in its second position the switching flap (6) opens a direct path for the air stream between the air inlet (2) and the second group of outlets (4) outside the heat exchanger and at the same time blocks the path of the air stream between the heat exchanger (5) and the second group of outlets (4).
