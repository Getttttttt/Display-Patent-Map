abstract
    The invention refers to an air renewing unit (10) for renewing the air of a usage environment (200) with air from an outer environment (300) comprising a transiting volume (11), at least one introducing section (12), a take-up section (13) for introducing a flow of take-up air (50) and a flow of replacing air (60), at least one feeding section (14) for feeding a flow of renewing air (70), at least one discharging section (15) for discharging a flow of exhausted air (80), connecting interfaces (17) inserted into said transiting volume (11), and at least one reversible thermo-hygrometric processing complex of an air-to-air heat pump type (16) partially inserted into said transiting volume (11). The peculiarity of the invention consists in the fact that said connecting interfaces (17) comprise a first and a second activable/deactivable barrier (18, 19) set up according to a crossed conformation and maneuverable according to a first/second working configuration depending on a direct/reverse operating mode of said reversible complex (16). The invention further refers to an operating procedure of said air renewing unit (10).
