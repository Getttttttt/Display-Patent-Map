abstract
    The present invention provides a thermal energy recovery system that is capable of suppressing a flow of a gas phase intermediate medium into an intermediate medium pump. A thermal energy recovery system includes an evaporator; an expander; a power recovery machine; a condenser; a working medium pump; heaters to evaporate the intermediate medium; an intermediate medium circulation flow passage; an intermediate medium pump; a by-pass flow passage to bypass the evaporator that is connected to the intermediate medium circulation flow passage; a cooling unit provided in the by-pass flow passage to condense the intermediate medium; and a valve provided in a portion on the upstream side of the cooling unit in the by-pass flow passage, the valve being a primary pressure adjustment valve to maintain the pressure value in a portion on the upstream side of the valve at a set value.
