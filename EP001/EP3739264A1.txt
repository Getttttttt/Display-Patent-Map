abstract
    The invention relates to an incineration plant for solid material having- a combustion material inlet (1) through which solid material can be introduced,- a combustion chamber (2) in which the solid material is introduced and in which the solid material is combusted,- a combustion grate (3) with which the solid material and combusted solid material can be conveyed through the combustion chamber (2),- a primary air supply below the top of the combustion grate (3),- at least one nozzle arranged above the combustion grate (3) with which a gaseous medium can be provided, the nozzle having a gas inlet and a gas outlet.
