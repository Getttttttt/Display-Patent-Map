abstract
    The pyrogasification plant (1) comprises a reaction chamber (2) having a base frame (3) supporting a lateral wall (4, 5, 6) wherein a material to be pyrogasified (M) can be introduced for being transformed into syngas (S), tar (T) and char (C), wherein the lateral wall (4, 5, 6) comprises an external supporting structure (4) supporting an internal metal cartridge (5), with a substantially tubular shape and having an upper extremity (5a) and a lower extremity (5b), both of which are open, the material to be pyrogasified (M) crossing the internal metal cartridge (5) from the upper extremity (5a) to the lower extremity (5b) remaining contained by the internal lateral surface of the internal metal cartridge (5).
