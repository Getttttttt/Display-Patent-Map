abstract
    The present invention is directed to a conversion kit for converting a karting vehicle from a gasoline motor driven karting vehicle comprising a gasoline motor fixed to the karting vehicle by means of gasoline motor fixing means, to an electric motor driven karting vehicle comprising an electric motor, said conversion kit includes:(a) a motor frame,(b) an electric motor mounted on the motor frame,(c) a motor control unit mounted on the motor frame,(d) a transducer for delivering an electric signal to the electric motor control unit, said electric signal being proportional to an accelerator pedal or throttle lever movement, said transducer being connectable to the motor control unit,(e) a battery assembly for powering the electric motor,(f) a transmission adapter for coupling the electric motor to the vehicle's transmission,characterized in that,(g) the motor frame comprises frame fixing means adapted for being mounted on fixing the motor frame to the karting vehicle after removal of the gasoline motor, using at least part of the gasoline motor fixing means, and(h) the transducer comprises acceleration coupling means for coupling an accelerator pedal or a throttle lever of the karting vehicle to the transducer.
