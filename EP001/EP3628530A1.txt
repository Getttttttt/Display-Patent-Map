abstract
    An improved power system architecture for a hybrid electric vehicle includes a power control unit including a motor inverter, a generator inverter, and a DC-to-DC converter, and vehicle power management (VPM) circuitry directly connected to each of the motor inverter, generator inverter, and DC-to-DC converter. In this arrangement, communication timing is greatly reduced, thereby allowing for feedforward control of the motor inverter, generator inverter, and DC-to-DC converter. The feedforward control enables the VPM circuitry to predict current influx or draw by a motor and determine the corresponding currents to provide to or from the generator and battery prior to or simultaneously with the actual current influx or draw by the motor. This improves vehicle dynamics and responsiveness, as well as enables complete recapture of braking currents and eliminates the need for a brake chopper resistor, thereby improving overall vehicle efficiency.
