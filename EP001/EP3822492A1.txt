abstract
    A hydraulic circuit having a function of compensation and energy recovery comprises a distribution module, a three-way compensated regulator device, a variable flow rate or pressure feeding assembly, an energy recovery device connected to the three-way compensated regulator device. The distribution module comprises a spool including an inlet recess and a drain recess configured so that the flow rate of fluid inlet to the utility is equal to or less than the one outlet therefrom, possibly net of a correction factor. There is also a respective first driving channel and a second driving channel configured so that a pressure taken upstream of the drain recess acts on a first side of the regulator device, and so that a pressure taken downstream of the drain recess in the first channel acts on a second side of the regulator device, and an additional force.
