abstract
    The present invention relates to a method and a device for melting melting stock, such as glass, in which a melting furnace (10) is heated via a burner flame (25; 29) generated by means of a burner port, to which fuel and oxidizer are supplied, a fuel-rich gas stream being introduced into the furnace (10) downstream from the burner port via at least one substoichiometrically operated burner (20; 22) and/or a fuel or fuel mixture being introduced into the furnace (10) downstream from the burner arrangement via at least one fuel nozzle, and a oxygen containing gas stream being introduced into the furnace (10) downstream from the at least one substoichiometrically operated burner (20; 22) and/or the at least one fuel nozzle.
