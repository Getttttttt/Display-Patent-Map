abstract
    A thermal efficiency improvement device 10 for a heating furnace is installed in an exhaust port 12 of the heating furnace to reduce effluent heat from the exhaust port 12 to the outside. The device 10 disposed along a flow of exhaust gas passing inside the exhaust port 12 includes at least one heat-resistant fabric members 15, 16 heated by exhaust gas and supporting members 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 fixing the fabric members 15, 16 to the exhaust port 12, and puts radiant heat from the heated fabric members 15, 16 back into the heating furnace to reduce effluent heat to the outside. By installing the device in an exhaust port of an existing or newly-built heating furnace, radiant heat from the fabric members heated by exhaust gas is put back into the heating furnace, and effluent heat from the exhaust port is reduced.
