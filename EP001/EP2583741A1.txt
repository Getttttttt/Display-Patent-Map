abstract
    A system includes a gas production source (12) configured to produce a gas stream (14) comprising nitrogen oxides (NOx) (16) and a hydrocarbon injector (18) disposed downstream of the gas production source (12) and configured to inject a hydrocarbon into the gas stream (14). The hydrocarbon is configured to oxidize molecules of the NOx (16) in the gas stream (14) to produce a higher order compound of nitrogen and oxygen (NyOz) (22). The system also includes a removal device (24) disposed downstream of the hydrocarbon injector (18). The removal device (24) is configured to remove the NyOz (22) from the gas stream via absorption or reaction.
