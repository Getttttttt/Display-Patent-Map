abstract
    The present invention relates to an air heating unit (10) and to the hot air generator (12) included in same, of the type used in premises normally used to breed and fatten animals which uses the heat generated to introduce it in the premises, expelling the combustion gases it produces to the outside. This unit is characterised by including in the same unit hot air generation for climate control of a premises and heat recovery from the air inside the premises that is extracted for renewal, as well as by heat recovery from the combustion gases, achieving a more efficient use of the thermal energy of both the air extracted from the premises in an efficient manner without adding combustion gases to the environment of the premises.
