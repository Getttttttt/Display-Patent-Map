abstract
    A controlling apparatus (5) is provided for a vehicle (1) including a motor (2), an inverter (3), and a battery (4). The controlling apparatus (5) includes a determiner (6), an estimator (7), and a controller (8). The determiner (6) judges whether a first condition is satisfied or not. The first condition is satisfied if the vehicle (1) is in a coasting state in a regeneration prohibited mode in which a regenerative brake is disabled. The estimator (7) estimates whether a second condition is satisfied or not. The second condition is satisfied if the motor (2) is not to generate a regenerative torque upon a shutdown of the inverter (3). The controller (8) shuts down the inverter (3) if the determiner (6) judges that the first condition is satisfied and the estimator (7) estimates that the second condition is satisfied.
