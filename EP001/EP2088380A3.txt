abstract
    A duct system for ventilation systems, including a supply duct (12) which is adapted to be connected with feed openings for ventilation air disposed at or in the vicinity of a window or an outer wall of one or more rooms, and a return duct (16) which is adapted to be connected with return openings for ventilation air disposed at a distance from a window or an outer wall of the one or more rooms, the supply and return ducts being provided in a common tubular duct (2) constituted by a pipe with circular cross-section, as the supply and return ducts (12, 16) are separated by a longitudinal partitioning (4) which consists of a metal sheet having a zigzag profile in a cross-sectional view perpendicular to the common tubular duct, where each of the supply and return ducts is connected via curving connecting flanges to a branch box (6) which at both sides of the common tubular duct has both supply and return connection pipe stubs (10, 14), and which is adapted to be connected with the supply and return ducts (12, 16) via separate lateral cutouts in the common tubular duct (2).
