abstract
    A method and an arrangement are provided for transferring heat from flue gas into fluid. The flue gas is passed through a flue gas scrubber (205, 305) in which the flue gas is cooled with scrubbing liquid. The scrubbing liquid is circulated from the flue gas scrubber (205, 305) into a heat exchanger (210, 310) and back to the flue gas scrubber (205, 305). A first portion of the fluid is passed through the heat exchanger (210, 310) whereby heat from the scrubbing liquid is transferred into the first portion of the fluid. Before the first portion of the fluid is passed through the heat exchanger (210, 310), heat from the first portion of the fluid is transferred into a second portion of the fluid.
