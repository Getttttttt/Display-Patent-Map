abstract
    To improve power failure detection accuracy, while increasing power failure detection sensitivity as compared to that in conventional techniques, in a controller of an AC electric vehicle having a power failure detection function in an overhead contact line. The controller includes a first specific-frequency-current computation unit 14a that extracts a current component corresponding to a first specific frequency set value Fset1 from a main-transformer output current IS and outputs the current component as a first specific-frequency current I1, a subtractor 16 that subtracts the first specific-frequency current I1 from the main-transformer output current IS and outputs a subtraction result as a current deviation DI1, a second specific-frequency-current computation unit 15a that extracts a current component corresponding to a second specific frequency set value Fset2 from the current deviation DI1 and outputs the current component as a second specific-frequency current I2, and a power-failure detection unit 19a that compares the second specific-frequency current I2 with a predetermined power-failure detection-current set value Iset and outputs a power-failure detection signal when the second specific-frequency current I2 is larger than the power-failure detection-current set value Iset.
