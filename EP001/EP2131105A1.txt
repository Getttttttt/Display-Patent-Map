abstract
    A process to convert a heat source into power is set forth within. This process involves heating an elevated pressure liquid working fluid (120) by indirect heat exchange against a heat source (114), wherein, at the end of this step, the heated working fluid (122) remains substantially in the liquid state. This process further involves expanding the heated working fluid (122) in a nozzle (123) to create a two-phase high velocity fluid (124). This process further involves work expanding the resulting heated, two-phase working fluid in a two-phase fluid expander (125) to generate a high pressure liquid stream (127), a low pressure vapor stream (126), and power. The process further involves condensing the low pressure vapor stream (126) by indirect heat exchange against a cooling fluid, increasing the pressure of this condensate, and re-combining the resultant condensate (128) with the high pressure liquid (127) to prepare the working fluid (120) for a new cycle.
