abstract
    A process for generating power by performing the following steps:(i) combustion of a combustible gaseous fuel to obtain a combustion gas,(ii) expanding said combustion gas in an expander wherein mechanical power and an expanded gas is generated and wherein a nitrogen comprising gas having a temperature of between 5 and 50°C and a pressure of between 0.101 and 2 MPa is used to cool the blades of the expander in a closed cooling circuit to obtain a used cooling gas and expanding said used cooling gas in a second expander to generate additional mechanical power.
