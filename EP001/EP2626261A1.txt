abstract
    A brake control device of an electric vehicle comprises a master cylinder 13, wheel cylinders 4FL, 4FR, 4RL and 4RR, a VDC brake fluid pressure unit 2, a motor controller 8 and an integrated controller 9. The motor controller 8 controls a regenerative braking force produced by a vehicle driving electric motor 5. The integrated controller 9 achieves, upon braking operation, a driver-desired deceleration based on the sum of a base hydraulic pressure part produced by a master cylinder pressure and a regenerative part produced by the regenerative braking force and compensates an insufficient regenerative part with a pressure increased part produced by the VDC brake fluid pressure unit 2. In addition to this, at the time when the VDC motor 21 is stopped due to the regenerative cooperative brake control, a pressure difference control effected by M/C cut solenoid valves 25 and 26 which are differential pressure regulating valves is carried out based on a motor rotation speed of the VDC motor 21.
