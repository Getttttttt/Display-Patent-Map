abstract
    A plurality of control maps respectively corresponding to a plurality of lever operation amounts are stored in a storage device. Each control map defines a driving force to be output from an electric motor such that the driving force corresponds to an accelerator operation amount and a vehicle speed. A control device uses a control map corresponding to an actual lever operation amount among the plurality of control maps and thereby calculates the driving force to be output from the electric motor based on an actual accelerator operation amount and an actual vehicle speed from the control map. This vehicle can alleviate discomfort caused when a driver accustomed to an engine vehicle operates an electric vehicle.
