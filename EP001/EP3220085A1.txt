abstract
    The present invention relates to a process for the treatment of iron-containing particulate waste, the process comprising:providing an iron-containing particulate waste having a moisture content of less than 50wt%;heating the iron-containing particulate waste in a treatment chamber of an oxy-fuel furnace comprising an oxy-fuel burner, to form a slag and, optionally, a molten iron layer; wherein the treatment chamber is provided with one or more plasma torches.
