abstract
    An exhaust gas treatment method includes: burning a combustible component in exhaust gas by causing the exhaust gas, which is produced in an electric furnace, to flow into a slag holding furnace and supplying oxygen-containing gas into the slag holding furnace; causing the burned exhaust gas to flow from the slag holding furnace to a suction device through an exhaust gas pipe; adjusting an internal pressure of the electric furnace by introducing external air into the exhaust gas pipe through an opening portion provided in the middle of the exhaust gas pipe; and changing an area of the opening portion depending on a variation in the internal pressure of the electric furnace by using an opening area changing unit provided in the opening portion.
