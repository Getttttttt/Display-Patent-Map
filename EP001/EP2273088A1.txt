abstract
    An avionics cooling system (10) includes a first heat exchange system (16), a second heat exchange system (18) and a vapor cycle system (14). The second heat exchange system has a heat sink capacity that is generally out of phase with a heat sink capacity of the first heat exchange system. The vapor cycle includes a fluid loop (20) in communication with the first and second heat exchange systems and the fluid loop transfers heat to the first and second heat exchange systems. A method for cooling aircraft components includes selectively directing a fluid having an elevated temperature in a fluid loop of a vapor cycle system to a first heat exchanger (28) to transfer heat from the fluid to a fuel based on a heat sink capacity of the fuel, selectively directing the fluid to a second heat exchanger (40) to transfer heat from the fluid to air based on a heat sink capacity of the air, and cooling aircraft components with the fluid.
