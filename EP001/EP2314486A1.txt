abstract
    A brake system for a motor vehicle, comprising a friction brake (2) adapted to mechanically apply a braking force to the vehicle,a regenerative brake (4) adapted to apply a braking force to the vehicle,a brake pedal (6) adapted to be moved by a driver of the vehicle through a pedal range from not depressed (Pp0) to fully depressed (Ppmax). The brake system further comprises a control unit (8) which comprises a working memory (10) with control instructions that refer inter alia to a brake pedal characteristic that incorporates inter alia a relationship between pedal depression and braking force BF, which control unit is adapted to activate the friction brake and the regenerative brake depending on pedal depression in accordance with said brake pedal characteristic.
