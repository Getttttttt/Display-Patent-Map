abstract
    The present invention provides an organic Rankine cycle energy recovery system comprising features which provide for fire suppression and/or ignition supression in the event of an unintentional release of a flammable component of the system, for example a flammable working fluid such as cyclopentane, into a part of the of the system in which the prevailing temperature is higher than the autoignition temperature of the flammable component. In one embodiment the organic Rankine cycle energy recovery system comprises an inert gas source disposed upstream of a hydrocarbon evaporator and is configured to purge the hydrocarbon evaporator with an inert gas on detection of a leak thereby.
