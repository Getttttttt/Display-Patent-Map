abstract
    Provided is a regenerative coordination brake control device that reduces the frequency of switching regenerative braking between a restricted state, in which regenerative braking is prohibited or suppressed, and a restriction removed state, in which the restriction on regenerative braking is removed. A regenerative coordination brake control device 91 includes a regeneration restriction condition determiner 92, which outputs a regeneration restriction signal S1 when determining that a restriction condition for prohibiting or suppressing regenerative braking is met, an acceleration operation detector 93, which outputs a regeneration restriction removal signal S2 when detecting an acceleration of the vehicle, and a regeneration restriction removal determiner 94, which determines whether a restriction on regenerative braking of the vehicle that is in the restricted state is to be continuously imposed or removed using the regeneration restriction removal signal S2 and the regeneration restriction signal S1. To determine whether regenerative braking in the restricted state of due to the regeneration restriction signal S1 is to be released from the restriction, the regeneration restriction removal determiner 94 determines that the restriction on regenerative braking is to be continuously imposed even without an output of the regeneration restriction signal S1, and the regeneration restriction removal determiner 94 determines that the restriction on regenerative braking is to be removed on condition that the regeneration restriction removal signal S2 is output.
