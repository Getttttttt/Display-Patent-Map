abstract
    The subject of the invention is a wireless ventilation system with recuperation powered from an integrated photovoltaic-wind panel, built of individual, decentralized ventilation devices (1) and an exhaust fan (2) in one of the other rooms, e.g. a bathroom. The system is characterized by minimized power and electricity consumption by only a single fan (5) located in decentralized, individual ventilation devices (1). Decentralized, individual ventilation devices (1), despite the fact that they are equipped with a single exhaust fan (5), allow the implementation of fresh air supply to the ventilated rooms and return air exhaust from the ventilated rooms with heat/cool recovery from the exhaust air. Due to the lack of ventilation ducts in ventilated rooms, the system is characterized by reduced energy consumption and pro-ecological character related to the reduced demand for materials for its production and using natural energy sources such as wind and sun. The lack of ventilation ducts does not require the use of a lowered suspended ceiling in ventilated rooms. The small dimensions of the system make the subject of the invention easy to adapt to new and existing buildings that require a ventilation system with reduced energy consumption. The source of the drive for the system is an integrated photovoltaic-wind panel (11), which uses free solar and wind energy in one element.
