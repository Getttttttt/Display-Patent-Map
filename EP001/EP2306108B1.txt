abstract
    An arrangement for ventilating one or more rooms in a building comprises a casing (7) having at least four openings arranged on the same side (12) thereof for conducting exhaust air from the rooms of the building as well as supply air from the exterior to said rooms of the building through a rotary heat exchanger (26) arranged inside said casing. Fan members (21, 23) are arranged inside said casing for creating air flows through the casing. Means (3) are configured to direct a flow of supply air from a first said fan member (21) in substantially one direction. Members (38, 39) of sound absorbing material defines a channel (37) extending from this first fan member to an outlet opening (15) of the casing.
