abstract
    A power generation system adopted for use on a vehicle (10) comprises a first rotary member (20), a second rotary member (21), a transmission gear set (22) and a brake module (23). The first rotary member (20) includes a first gear (201), an electromagnetic winding (202), a housing space (203) for installation of the second rotary member (21) and an electric output portion (205). The second rotary member (21) includes a second gear (211) with a gear ratio smaller than that of the first gear, an excitation winding (212) and an electric input portion (213). The transmission gear set (22) includes at least one transmission gear (222) to engage with the first gear (201) and the second gear (211). The transmission gear (222) is driven by the first gear (201) to drive the second gear (211) to rotate in a direction opposite to the first gear (201). The brake module (23) detects operation condition of a brake pedal (15) and a drive pedal (13) made by the driver, and outputs an excitation current to the electric output portion (205) via a first brush (231) to generate electric power.
