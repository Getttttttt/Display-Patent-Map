abstract
    Split flow regenerative power cycle systems (100, 200, 300, 800, 1000) are provided. The systems (100, 200, 300, 800, 1000) can include a gas turbine (180, 280, 380, 880, 1080) configured to generate a split flow exhaust stream (110, 210, 310, 810, 1010) having a first exhaust stream (311, 811, 1011) and a second exhaust stream (312, 812, 1012), a regenerator (135, 235, 335, 835 1035) operatively coupled to the gas turbine (180, 280, 380, 880, 1080) and configured to receive the first exhaust stream (311, 811, 1011), and a heat recovery steam generator (250, 350, 850, 1050) operatively coupled to the gas turbine (180, 280, 380, 880, 1080) and configured to receive a second exhaust stream (312, 812, 1012). The systems (100, 200, 300, 800, 1000) can include generating a gas turbine exhaust stream from a gas turbine (180, 280, 380, 880, 1080), splitting the exhaust stream to a first exhaust stream (311, 811, 1011) and a second exhaust stream (312, 812, 1012), directing the first exhaust stream (311, 811, 1011) from the gas turbine (180, 280, 380, 880, 1080) to a first regenerative power cycle and directing the second exhaust stream (312, 812, 1012) from the gas turbine (180, 280, 380, 880, 1080) to a second heat recovery power cycle.
