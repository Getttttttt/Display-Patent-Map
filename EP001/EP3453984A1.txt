abstract
    A valve (1) for draining the condensate of a condensing boiler extends along an axis (A) and comprises a valve body (2); a first and a second pipe (3, 4) that protrude inside the valve body (2) on opposite sides of the valve body parallel to the axis (A); at least one shutter (5; 5, 6), which is arranged inside the valve body (2), is moveable with respect to the valve body (2) along the axis (A), and is configured to float in the condensate to allow the condensate to flow, and shut the free end of the first and the second pipe (3, 4) inside the valve body (2) when the condensate is not flowing.
