abstract
    Disclosed is a heat energy recovery system including: a heat energy recovery circuit that causes a working medium to circulate by means of a circulation pump to exchange heat with supercharged air from a supercharger via a first heater and exchange heat with steam from an exhaust-gas economizer via a second heater, in order to integrally drive a turbine and a generator; and a controller that performs stop control to stop the circulation pump based on the flow state of the steam in a first steam flow path that causes the steam to flow from the exhaust-gas economizer to a soot blower.
