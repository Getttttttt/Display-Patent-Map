abstract
    A water heating system that includes a burner unit (102) with an exhaust gas outlet (122), a primary heat exchanger (104) with primary passageways for carrying water to be heated by the burner unit (102) and an auxiliary heat exchanger (110, 108) having first passageways connected to the exhaust gas outlet (122). The auxiliary heat exchanger (108, 110) includes a secondary heat exchange unit (108) with second passageways for water and a tertiary heat exchange unit (110) with third passageways for liquid or water or air. The first passageways of the auxiliary heat exchanger (108, 110) are in heat transfer contact with the second passageways and with the third passageways.
