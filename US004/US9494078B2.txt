abstract
    The present invention is a prime mover with recovered energy driven compression for stationary and motor vehicle application. Efficient low compression operation, especially beneficial to small gas turbines, is enabled with either ambient or cryogenic intake air. Recovered energy, liquefied air cooling and re-liquefaction of air by a cryogenic sink minimize motive fluid compression work of a jet compressor driving exhaust gas recirculation. Regenerative heat exchanger terminal temperature difference relative to turbine temperature drop and heat exchanger surface area are reduced.
