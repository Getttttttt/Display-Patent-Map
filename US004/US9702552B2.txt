abstract
    A method and system for the conversion of waste into energy in a sealed system where combustion does not take place and the operating pressure prior to the inlet of the steam or power generating equipment is maintained below atmospheric pressure. Destruction of the RDF (refuse derived fuel) is accomplished by subjecting the RDF to a high temperature environment under controlled conditions in a purpose designed and built reactor. The high temperature environment, <5000° C., is achieved through the use of one or more non-transferred plasma torches for generation of plasma gas. The plasma gas exiting the torch and provides the thermal energy for the continual gasification of metallurgic coke configured as a carbon bed in the lower part of the reactor, which acts as a thermal catalyst and this provides the thermal energy for the gasification process.
