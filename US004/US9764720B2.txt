abstract
    A method for operating an electric motor for braking a vehicle, including controlling the electric motor in such a way that the vehicle is slowed or decelerated with the aid of a motor braking torque exerted by the controlled electric motor. The method includes ascertaining whether a requested setpoint speed change is in a predefined normal range, and if so, the electric motor is controlled in such a way that a load to be applied by the electric motor remains less than or equal to a nominal load capacity of the electric motor. If the requested setpoint speed change is outside the predefined normal range, the electric motor is controlled in such a way that the load to be applied by the electric motor exceeds the nominal load capacity of the electric motor, at least during a predefined overload operation time interval.
