abstract
    A building with rotating housings has a main structure and multiple housing units. The main structure has a structure body, a housing track extending spirally upward outside of the structure body, and a temporary track moveably mounted in the structure body. When changing positions of the housing units, braking devices of all the housing units are released temporarily to make the housing units slide down by gravity along the housing track for a distance of one housing unit, and the housing unit at the lowest position slides to the temporary track. Then the temporary track and said housing unit are moved upward. Finally the braking device of said housing unit is released temporarily to make said housing unit slide down to the housing track to be the highest housing unit. The housing units can change their positions, heights, and angles at regular or predetermined timeline.
