abstract
    Methods and systems for controlling regenerative braking in a vehicle having a regenerative braking system are provided. Values of one or more dynamic variables are obtained during operation of the vehicle. A maximum regenerative braking torque is calculated using the dynamic variable values. Regenerative braking torque is provided up to the maximum regenerative braking torque.
