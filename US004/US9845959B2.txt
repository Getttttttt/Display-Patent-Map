abstract
    A ventilation device for ventilating rooms, has a first air routing device for routing a first flow of air, the routing device having a first room-side outlet, a first flow space in which at least one first fan capable of bidirectional operation is arranged, and a first outside outlet; a second air routing device for routing a second flow of air, which is fluidically completely separate from the first air routing device and has a second room-side outlet, a second flow space in which at least one second fan capable of bidirectional operation is arranged, and a second outside outlet; an integral gas-solid heat exchanger adapted to route the first flow of air and the second flow of air in a respective set of passageways, in a fluidically separated but thermally coupled manner, wherein the solid in the first and the second air routing device additionally forms a respective regenerator.
