abstract
    Systems and methods are disclosed for reducing engine fuel consumption during regenerative braking. According to certain embodiments, the regenerative braking system has an engine, a generator, a rectifier, a first inverter, a traction motor, and a reverse recovery unit. The generator is configured to be driven by the engine to produce AC electrical power. The rectifier is configured to receive AC electrical power from the generator and convert the AC power to DC power. The first inverter is configured to receive the DC power and convert the DC power to AC power. The traction motor is configured to be driven by the AC power in a traction mode, and to produce regenerated power when rotated in reverse in a regenerative braking mode. The reverse recovery unit has a second inverter and a filter. The second inverter is electrically connected in parallel with the rectifier and configured to communicate at least part of the regenerated power from the traction motor to the generator during the regenerative braking mode. The filter is electrically connected downstream of the second inverter and in parallel with the rectifier. The filter is configured to filter transient voltage generated by the second inverter during the regenerative braking mode.
