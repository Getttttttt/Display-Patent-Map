abstract
    The invention disclosed herein is an energy recovery system, for an electric motor, that uses the properties of dynamic braking to directly recharge a capacitive load made up of energy storage devices. The system contains switching circuitry that configures the energy storage devices into a capacitive load when braking is needed. Otherwise, the system configures the energy storage devices into a power supply for regular motor operation.
