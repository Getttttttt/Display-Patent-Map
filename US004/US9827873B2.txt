abstract
    Provided is an electric vehicle control system capable of securing good response and slip stopping property with respect to changes in a road surface condition. The system includes a vehicle controller configured to calculate a driver's demand torque command value according to a driver's accelerating or braking operation, a first communication device capable of communicating between a hydraulic controller and a motor controller, and a second communication device capable of communicating between the vehicle controller and the motor controller. The system includes a control system in which the hydraulic controller transmits a motor torque command value to the motor controller through the first communication device; the vehicle controller transmits the driver's demand torque command value to the motor controller through the second communication device; and the motor controller selects either one of the received motor torque command value and the received driver's demand torque command value as the command value.
