abstract
    To provide a waste heat recovery power generation plant for sintering facility capable of efficiently recovering a waste heat of a sintering machine in addition to that of a sintered-ore cooler, while restraining that sulfuric anhydride contained in an exhaust gas of the sintering machine forms drops. An SM boiler is configured to heat all of or a part of hot water generated by an SC boiler, by introducing a high temperature part of an exhaust gas of a sintering machine. At this time, a temperature of the hot water to be supplied to the SM boiler is controlled such that a temperature of an exhaust gas at an exhaust-gas temperature of the SM boiler is maintained at a temperature higher than an acid dew point.
