abstract
    A vehicle includes a motor serving as a driving source configured to run the vehicle, and a high-power and high-capacity assembled batteries, each of the assembled batteries being formed to include secondary batteries configured to supply an electric power to the motor, the secondary batteries of the assembled batteries being housed in different cases. The high-power and high-capacity assembled batteries are arranged around a luggage space located in a rearward portion of the vehicle. The high-power assembled battery is chargeable and dischargeable with a current larger than a current in the high-capacity assembled battery. The high-capacity assembled battery has an energy capacity larger than an energy capacity of the high-power assembled battery. The high-capacity assembled battery is arranged above or below the high-power assembled battery in the vehicle, and at least a portion of the high-capacity assembled battery protrudes from the high-power assembled battery rearward in the vehicle.
