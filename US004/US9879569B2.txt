abstract
    A method and a device for operating a waste heat utilization device for an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle is disclosed. The waste heat utilization device contains a waste heat utilization circuit in which a working medium circulates. A conveyor, an evaporator, an expansion machine, and a condenser are disposed in the waste heat utilization circuit. A basic adjustment of the waste heat utilization circuit is provided, which as a function of a heat input into the working medium adjusts the mass flow rate at the conveyor and/or the ratio between high pressure and low pressure at the expansion machine. In addition, a pilot control is provided which recognizes a change of the operating point of the internal combustion engine and, when the operating point is changed, controls the condensation output of the condenser in accordance with a mass distribution of the working medium in the waste heat utilization circuit optimized to the new operating point.
