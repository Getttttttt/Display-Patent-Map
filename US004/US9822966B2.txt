abstract
    A quench system includes a housing having a longitudinal axis, a gas path for a gas within the housing, a steam input and output, and a dip tube within the housing. The dip tube includes tubing arranged to form a wall. A steam path, separate from the gas path, is disposed within the tubing in a thickness of the wall. The dip tube is configured to allow passage of the gas along the gas path. The steam input is fluidically connected to the steam output by the tubing. The quench system is configured to cool the gas along the gas path and heat steam along the steam path within the tubing of the dip tube.
