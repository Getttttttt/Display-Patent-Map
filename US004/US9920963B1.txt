abstract
    The invention presents air-conditioning system with chiller that provides, when operated in the cooling mode, cooling hardware for conditioning space and a heat exchanger for cooling and dehumidification of ambient air in supply air stream with cold liquid. In addition, the invention offers a method and design of a heat utilization system. The method incorporates refrigeration cycle with two consecutive expansions, two expansion devices, and a heat exchanger operating as a second condenser. The method can be used for air conditioners and chillers reheating over-chilled for dehumidification indoor and supply air. The method and design allow energy efficient heat utilization with variable amount of utilized heat.
