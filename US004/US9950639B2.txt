abstract
    In one aspect, a system for torsional damping of electric traction drives comprises dual Kalman filters to correct for oscillations based on measured traction motor speed and commanded traction motor torque. A first Kalman filter can perform a state space estimate of the shaft torque providing negative feedback to the final torque command in order to eliminate resonant components from the commanded torque and quickly damp external disturbances. A second Kalman filter provides a state space estimation of the load torque or, equivalently, load acceleration. This second Kalman filter can ignore commanded torque and can provide a damping feedback when the wheel speed deviates from the vehicle speed.
