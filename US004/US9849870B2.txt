abstract
    This hybrid vehicle (10) has an HV mode and an EV mode, creates a predetermined traveling plan in a manner so as to switch between HV mode and EV mode on the basis of map information, and performs mode switching control on the basis of the traveling plan. The hybrid vehicle (10) limits the execution of mode switching control that is on the basis of the traveling plan in the case of a predetermined state such that the power that can be output by a battery (28) that is the storage battery connected to a second MG (24) that is a rotary electric machine driven during execution of the EV mode is limited.
