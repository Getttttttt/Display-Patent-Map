abstract
    An apparatus and a method of controlling creep driving of an electric vehicle are provided to improve driving convenience and fuel efficiency. The apparatus is applied to an electric vehicle to which a ‘one-foot drive’ mode is applied to execute the creep driving and actively determine whether the creep driving is provided based on a vehicle speed.
