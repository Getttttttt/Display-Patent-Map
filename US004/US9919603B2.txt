abstract
    The present invention improves emergency evasion performance. An operation control system for a vehicle that is provided with a risk-potential determining unit that determines the risk potential of a vehicle on the basis of external environment information and/or vehicle information, a friction braking unit that applies friction braking force to the vehicle, and a regenerative braking device that applies regenerative braking force to the vehicle, the operation control system being provided with a control value determining unit that determines a first control value that is for determining the size of the friction braking force and determines a second control value that is for determining the size of the regenerative braking force. The control value determining unit determines at least the first control value on the basis of the risk potential determined by the risk-potential determining unit.
