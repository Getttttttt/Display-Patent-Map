abstract
    A system for generating electrical power, including a frame defining a vertical axis and a horizontal axis, and having a support base generally extending along the longitudinal axis. The support base has an input end and an output end. At least a first shear station includes a first shearing blade adapted to reciprocate in a vertical direction between a first displaced position displaced from the support base and a second approximated position proximate the support base to shear the tree waste supported by the support base. An index blade is adapted for at least general horizontal movement along the support base. The index blade is dimensioned and adapted to direct the sheared tree waste toward the output end of the support base. A pulverizing station receives the sheared tree waste directed through the output end of the support base. The pulverizing station includes a pulverizing member actuable to pulverize the sheared tree waste. A furnace receives and converts the pulverized tree waste into steam energy. A steam generator turbine converts the steam energy into electricity.
