abstract
    Provided is an inexpensive and simple solar power system. A solar power system according to the present invention includes: a heat collection apparatus (2, 4); a steam turbine (5), a power generator (16); a superheated steam supply line which supplies the steam turbine with superheated steam generated by the heat collection apparatus; a water supply line which condenses the steam expelled from the steam turbine into water and supplies the condensed water to the heat collection apparatus; a heat storage device (8) which has a heat storage medium; a first line which branches from the superheated steam supply line and which supplies the heat storage device with the superheated steam flowing through the superheated steam supply line; a second line which branches from the water supply line and which supplies the heat storage device with the water flowing through the water supply line; and a third line which supplies the steam turbine with superheated steam generated by the heat storage device. The heat storage device stores the heat of the superheated steam which has flowed through the first line in the heat storage medium, and heats the water which has flowed through the second line with the heat storage medium to thereby generate the superheated steam.
