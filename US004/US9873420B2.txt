abstract
    A method of controlling a vehicle includes calculating a desired deceleration limited regeneration torque request based on a requested deceleration input from a driver. If current dynamic operating conditions of the vehicle are in a performance region that permits an increase to the regeneration torque request, the desired deceleration limited regeneration torque request is increased based on a regeneration torque overhead, to define a modified axle regeneration torque request. Modified torque values are output based on the modified axle regeneration torque request. If the torque control values will cause an estimated yaw rate that is less than a target yaw rate, then the modified torque values are applied. Otherwise, the modified torque values are re-defined until the estimated yaw rate is not greater than the target yaw rate, and the re-defined values of the modified torque values are applied.
