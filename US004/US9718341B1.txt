abstract
    Power systems, heat exchanger systems, electrical regeneration systems and air drag reduction systems for a wheeled vehicle are provided. The systems comprise a vehicle that includes a compressed air system and electrical system. The power and drag reduction system also comprises a plurality of pneumatic motors, one each connected to each wheel, the pneumatic motors using compressed air to drive each wheel. The electrical system supports vehicle braking and regenerates electricity for vehicle batteries. A heat exchanger heats expanding air and is configured to substantially evenly distribute said heated air to the pneumatic motors. Air from a front grill is diverted to impellers that turn electric generators to regenerate power and reduce drag. A drag reducing arrangement blending mirrors with camera into the vehicle body is included as is a plug-in 120-volt trickle charge system and a quick charge (DC) system for battery charging.
