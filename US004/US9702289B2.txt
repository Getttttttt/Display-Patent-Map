abstract
    A waste heat recovery (WHR) system operates in a reverse mode, permitting using the WHR system to transfer heat to the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine. In another configuration, a WHR system may operate in two modes. The first mode removes heat from exhaust gas of an engine to perform useful work. The second mode transfers heat to the exhaust gas. The benefit of this flexible system is that a WHR system is adaptable to rapidly heat exhaust gas at startup and during other conditions where the temperature of the exhaust gas is less than a predetermined operating range. Because of the ability to rapidly warm engine exhaust gas, an exhaust gas receiving system, such as an EGR or an aftertreatment system, may function to reduce the emissions of the engine more quickly. Because this system is reversible, it retains the capability of a conventional WHR system.
