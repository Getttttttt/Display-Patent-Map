abstract
    An air handling unit, particularly for data center cooling, operates to cool a flow of return air from a conditioned space using a flow of ambient air. The return air is recirculated to the conditioned space as supply air. The flow of ambient air can be adiabatically cooled to a lower temperature to provide additional cooling. A flow of makeup air can be joined with the cooled return air to form the supply air, and can be sourced from the ambient environment directly or from the heated flow of ambient air.
