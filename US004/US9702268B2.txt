abstract
    In a device for controlling a working fluid with low freezing point circulating in a closed loop working on a Rankine cycle, the loop includes a compression/circulation pump for the fluid in liquid form, a heat exchanger swept by a hot source for evaporation of the fluid, expansion machine for the fluid in vapour form, a cooling exchanger swept by a cold source for condensation of the working fluid, a working fluid tank and working fluid circulation lines. The working fluid tank is connected to a depression generator.
