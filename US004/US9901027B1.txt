abstract
    An anhydrous ammonia vapor charge unit for an applicator tank maintains a pressure charge on an applicator tank. A secondary anhydrous ammonia tank is disposed adjacent to the applicator tank. Ammonia vapor from the secondary tank is passed through a vapor compressor and then is injected into the applicator tank to provide a greater pressure charge within the applicator tank. In a second embodiment, a small portion of a liquid flow stream of ammonia being removed from the applicator tank is separated from the flow stream, passed through a heat vaporizer for expanding from a liquid to a gas, passed through a vapor pressure, and then is injected into the applicator tank for maintaining the pressure charge on the applicator tank. Preferably the heat vaporizer used hydraulic fluid from a tractor to heat the anhydrous ammonia.
