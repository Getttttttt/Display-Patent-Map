abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a system for producing high pressure steam from low quality feedwater for a designated process. The system includes a first closed loop in fluid communication with a boiler and a heat exchanger assembly. A first fluid flows through the first closed loop, and is of acceptable quality for use in a boiler. Heat from the boiler is transferred to a second loop through the heat exchanger assembly. The second loop includes the low quality feedwater, which is converted to high pressure steam. The high pressure steam produced from the low quality water can be used in the designated process. This reduces corrosion/downtime in the boiler that might otherwise occur if the low quality water was directly heated by the boiler.
