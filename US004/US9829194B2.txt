abstract
    The present invention provides a device which comprises: a heat exchanger (1) for transferring heat of a heat-supplying medium to a working medium which differs from said heat-supplying medium, a first supply device designed to provide a flow of the heat-supplying medium at a first temperature from a heat source to the heat exchanger, and a second supply device which is designed to deliver the heat-supplying medium after it has passed through the heat exchanger, and/or a further medium at a second temperature lower than the first temperature, to the flow of the heat-supplying medium at the first temperature.
