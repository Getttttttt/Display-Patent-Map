abstract
    A reflow oven includes a chamber housing including surfaces that are in contact with heated air mixed with contaminants, including flux, and a water-soluble layer selectively applied to the surfaces of the chamber housing. Embodiments of the reflow oven include an acrylic-based layer, such as an acrylic paint. In one embodiment, the acrylic paint includes a water-soluble polymer, a polymer emulsion, and water. The water-soluble polymer includes butyl benzyl phthalate. In some embodiments, the acrylic paint includes 1-10% by weight butyl benzyl phthalate, 30-55% by weight acrylic polymer emulsion, and balance water. In a certain embodiment, the acrylic paint includes 1-5% by weight butyl benzyl phthalate, 35-50% by weight acrylic poly emulsion, and balance water. Methods of treating surfaces of the reflow oven are further disclosed.
