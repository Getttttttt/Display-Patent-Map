abstract
    A method and system for conditioning air utilizing a liquid desiccant and the ability to use low grade and clean renewable heat sources for heating, cooling, dehumidifying and humidifying air as well as regenerating desiccant, with a low temperature differential for inlet and outlet air. Said system provides some filtering, purifying and sterilization of air. Said system may have low resistance through the system to lower fan energy. Said system may have low resistance through system pipework to lower pump energy.
