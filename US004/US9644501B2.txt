abstract
    A heat capturing module for obtaining useful energy from waste heat includes an extendable hood directing hot gas through a heat exchange assembly having a plurality of heat pipes. A closed flow loop directs a heat transfer medium through the heat exchange assembly to heat the heat transfer medium, and directs the heated medium for use by an application. In one embodiment, the closed flow loop directs the heat transfer medium through an organic Rankine cycle unit where heat is converted to electrical power. An exhaust system having a variable-speed induction fan induces flow of the hot gas through the heat exchange assembly. The speed of the induction fan may be controlled to maintain a setpoint temperature of the heat transfer medium. The hood may be extended and retracted based on a measured temperature of gas at an intake region of the hood. The module is transportable by truck trailer.
