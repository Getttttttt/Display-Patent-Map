abstract
    A combined cycle power plant with a gas and steam turbine system arranged on a single shaft and integrated with a cogeneration plant having a heat consumer such as a district heating system or industrial plant, including one or more steam extractions at an intermediate-pressure steam turbine that are arranged at the upper casing half-shell of the turbine and extraction steam lines that lead the extracted steam to heat exchangers of the cogeneration plant. The steam extraction outlets are arranged either singly at or near the uppermost point of the casing or in pairs to either side of the uppermost point of the casing. The specific arrangement of the extractions allows a floor-mounting of the single-shaft combined cycle power plant and as such a cost and space efficient realization of the power plant.
