abstract
    A system for energy optimization in a plant (3) for producing direct-reduced metal ores (3). The plant (3) has at least one reduction unit (12), a device for separating gas mixtures (7, 7 a,  7 b) having an associated compressing device (4, 4 a,  4 b), and a gas-heating device (10) upstream of the reduction unit (12). Part of the process gases (2, 2 a,  2 b) is fed by a feed line from a smelting reduction plant to the plant for producing direct-reduced metal ores (3). A turbine (8, 8 a,  8 b) is fit between the device for separating gas mixtures (7, 7 a,  7 b) and the gas-heating device (10) upstream of the reduction unit (12) such that a pressure drop between the device for separating gas mixtures (7, 7 a,  7 b) and the reduction unit (12) is converted into forms of energy that can be used to operate additional components (4, 4 a,  4 b,  15, 15 a,  15 b) of the plant (3), in particular electrical energy and/or mechanical energy. Energy consumption of the plant (3) is reduced.
