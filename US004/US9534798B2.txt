abstract
    A coupled air-conditioning device including a dehumidification system and a vapor compression-type refrigeration system which are connected through a pipeline. The vapor compression-type refrigeration system is a closed circuit including an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser and an expansion valve. The dehumidification system includes a desiccant-wheel with a regeneration area and a processing area, a processing air blower, a regeneration air blower and an electric motor driving the desiccant-wheel to rotate. The processing air blower and the regeneration air blower are provided with an exhaust port. The condenser includes a phase-change condensation heat exchanger and a refrigerant gas cooler. The refrigerant gas cooler operates to cool the overheated refrigerant discharged from the compressor into a saturated refrigerant in gas state, employing a structural form of a tube-fin heat exchanger comprising a heat exchange tube and a fin piece.
