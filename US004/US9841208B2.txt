abstract
    A heat and energy recovery ventilation unit for a building, having an inside and an outside. The unit including a main body having a fresh air inlet and an indoor air outlet on one side and a fresh air outlet and an indoor air inlet on the other side and having an air to air heat exchanger within the main body and connected to each of said inlets and outlets to define respective air flow passageways for each of said indoor air and said fresh air, the heat exchanger permitting heat and energy exchange between said indoor air and said fresh air. Also included is a first variable speed blower and a second variable speed blower and at least one electronic air flow sensor to measure at least one of the air flows the air flow sensor producing at least one electronic signal related to the sensed air flow. Also included is a controller for receiving the data signal, the controller using the data signal to control at least one of the variable speed blowers to provide a balanced fresh air inflow and indoor air outflow through the ventilation unit. A method of operating the unit is also disclosed.
