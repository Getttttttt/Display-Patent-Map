abstract
    The application describes a self-propelling work machine, in the form of a truck, having an electric drive comprising at least one electric motor, a generator drivable by an internal combustion engine for the power supply of the electric drive, and a braking apparatus for braking the work machine, wherein the braking apparatus provides a regenerative braking by the electric drive and a feedback apparatus for feeding back electrical motor braking power of the electric motor to the generator to apply the motor braking power on the internal combustion engine. The application further describes a method for braking the work machine. A braking control apparatus is provided for an automatic connection of a mechanical brake in dependence on the motor braking power fed back to the internal combustion engine and/or in dependence on the operating state of the internal combustion engine acted on by the fed back motor braking power.
