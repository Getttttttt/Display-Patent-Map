abstract
    Denitrifying bypass exhaust gases in a cement clinker producing plant. The plant comprises a rotary kiln connected to a calciner for the deacidification of raw material or to a rotary kiln riser shaft via a rotary kiln inlet chamber, and the bypass exhaust gas being drawn off in the region of the rotary kiln inlet chamber. The method comprises: cooling the bypass gas to between 260 C and 400 C in a cooling device, injecting an ammonia-, urea-, and/or ammonium-containing substance into the cooled bypass gas, introducing the cooled and mixed bypass gas into a ceramic filter system to filter out any halide and sulfate of the alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals precipitated during cooling the gas, and any nitrogen not reacted by the injected substances is chemically selectively reduced over a catalytic converter which is located in or directly downstream of the ceramic filter system.
