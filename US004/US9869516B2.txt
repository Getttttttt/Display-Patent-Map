abstract
    A continuous heating furnace (200) includes a conveyance body (210) stretched in an endless shape and configured to convey a burning target, a furnace main body (212) partially or entirely surrounding the conveyance body to form a burning space, and a roller (214) configured to support a portion of the conveyance body in the furnace main body. The continuous heating furnace (200) further includes one or more closed gas heaters having an introduction hole configured to introduce a fuel gas into a heater main body, a combustion chamber in which the fuel gas is combusted, a discharge section to which an exhaust gas is guided, a radiation surface heated by the exhaust gas flowing through the discharge section or combustion in the combustion chamber and configured to transfer radiant heat to a burning target, and an exhaust hole configured to exhaust the exhaust gas that heats the radiation surface to the outside of the heater main body, and disposed in the furnace main body, and an exhaust pipe (216) in communication with the exhaust hole of the closed gas heater and through which the exhaust gas is guided. In addition, the exhaust pipe enables heat exchange between the exhaust gas flowing through the exhaust pipe and the roller.
