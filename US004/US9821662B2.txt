abstract
    A braking force (BF) control system includes: a first required BF calculator that calculates, based on a position of the brake pedal, a first required friction BF allocated to the friction brake and a first required regenerative BF allocated to regenerative control of the drive motor; a second required BF calculator that calculates, based on a position of the acceleration pedal, a second required friction BF allocated to the friction brake and a second required regenerative BF allocated to the regenerative control; a regenerative total BF calculation/execution portion that calculates a regenerative total BF based on the first and second required regenerative BFs and performs the regenerative control based on the regenerative total BF; and a friction total BF calculation/execution portion that calculates a friction total BF based on the first and second required friction BFs and controls the friction brake based on the friction total BF.
