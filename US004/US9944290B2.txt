abstract
    A method controls regenerative braking of a motor vehicle provided with an electric or hybrid powertrain. The method includes determining that a driver is pressing neither a throttle pedal nor a brake pedal of the vehicle. The method also includes determining a correction coefficient as a function of a torque supplied by a motor of the powertrain, of a speed and an angular velocity at a wheel of the vehicle, of a gradient, of a mass of the vehicle, and of friction. Next, the method includes determining a setpoint for regenerative braking without pressure on the brake pedal as a function of the correction coefficient and of two maps of torque as a function of a rotational speed of the powertrain, for a substantially zero gradient and a vehicle mass substantially equal to a reference mass of the vehicle.
