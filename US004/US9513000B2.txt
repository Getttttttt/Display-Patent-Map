abstract
    An oxygen combustion system includes a boiler to burn fuel using combustion gas composed of oxygen-rich gas and circulating flue gas, a dust remover disposed in a flue through which flue gas discharged from the boiler flows, a second flue leading the combustion gas to the boiler, the combustion gas being made by mixing the circulating flue gas extracted downstream of the dust remover with the oxygen-rich gas, a combustion gas heater exchanging heat between the flue gas flowing between the boiler and dust remover and the combustion gas flowing through the second flue, and a flue gas cooler disposed between the heater and the dust remover to cool the flue gas. A control unit controls at least one of a flow rate and cooling medium temperature of the flue gas cooler such that temperature of the flue gas introduced into the dust remover will be between 90° C. and 140° C.
