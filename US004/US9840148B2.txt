abstract
    A control system for an electric motor usable as a generator of a vehicle includes: a first control device and a second control device each configured to define, in consideration of at least one furnished first specification signal with regard to a driver-requested or autonomously requested braking input, at least one target braking torque variable with regard to at least one generator braking torque to be exerted by way of the at least one electric motor on at least one wheel of the vehicle and/or on at least one axle of the vehicle, and to output to the at least one electric motor, and/or to at least one electronic control system of the at least one electric motor, at least one output signal corresponding to the at least one target braking torque variable.
