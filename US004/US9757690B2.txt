abstract
    A reactor apparatus and method for removing and/or reducing NOx, CO, carbon particulates and hydrocarbons from exhaust gases produced by industrial processes includes a reactor including an inlet plenum, a reaction chamber, an outlet plenum, and a heat exchanger wherein gases exiting the reaction chamber heat gases entering the reaction chamber. EGR is drawn through a cooling heat exchanger with an injection blower and is delivered through control valves to the reaction chamber, the inlet plenum and to an add fuel mixing chamber whereby mixed fuel and EGR is delivered to the reaction chamber. A feedback controller controls the flow valves responsive to the temperatures in the reaction chamber entrance and the outlet plenum.
