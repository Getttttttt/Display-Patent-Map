abstract
    The brake controller includes a friction brake device, a regeneration brake device, a required braking force calculating portion, a vehicle motion control portion which distributes the required braking force to the non-regeneration braking side right/left wheels that is either one of the right/left front wheels and right/left rear wheels, a maximum braking force calculating portion which calculates the maximum braking force at each wheel and a braking force control portion-which calculates the regeneration braking force generated at the regeneration braking side right/left wheels within a range where the regeneration braking force to be generated at the regeneration braking side right/left wheels does not exceed a smaller value of the maximum braking forces of the regeneration braking side right/left wheels, based on the required braking force and the distribution of the braking force to the non-regeneration braking side right/left wheels.
