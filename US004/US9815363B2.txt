abstract
    A system, method, and device for operations of an electrically motorized vehicle. The vehicle can utilize an electrically motorized wheel to convert a non-motorized wheeled vehicle to an electrically motorized wheeled vehicle. A method of controlling the device of the electrically motorized wheel includes detecting a temperature of an electric motor of the electrically motorized wheel and controlling operation of the electric motor to maintain the detected temperature within a desired range.
