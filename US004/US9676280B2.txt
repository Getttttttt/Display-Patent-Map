abstract
    A system for managing braking torque in a machine uses a first braking system, a second braking system that is independent of the first braking system and a controller that monitors activity in both braking systems. The controller selectively reduces torque in the first braking system as torque in the second braking system increases to limit undesired effects of possible over-braking.
