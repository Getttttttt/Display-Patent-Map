abstract
    The non-contact electric power reception device includes an electric power reception portion and an electric load device. The electric power reception portion is configured such that best transmission efficiency at a power supply frequency of the power supply portion used for non-contact electric power transmission is achieved when the electric power reception portion is arranged with its position being displaced from a position of the electric power transmission portion. Preferably, the electric power reception portion is configured such that a peak frequency at which transmission efficiency at the time of change in power transmission frequency exhibits a peak and a power supply frequency match with each other when the electric power reception portion is arranged with positions in a horizontal direction of a central axis of the electric power reception portion and a central axis of the electric power transmission portion being displaced from each other.
