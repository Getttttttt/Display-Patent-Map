abstract
    A control apparatus mounted on a railcar including a plurality of wheelsets includes: a torque basic value setting portion configured to set a basic value of torque applied to each of the plurality of wheelsets; an adhesion determining portion configured to determine whether or not each of the plurality of wheelsets adheres to a rail; and a torque correcting portion configured to correct the basic value of the torque to obtain a corrected value that is smaller than the basic value. The plurality of wheelsets includes one or more specific wheelsets and one or more general wheelsets other than the specific wheelsets. The torque correcting portion calculates the corrected value of the torque, applied to the general wheelset, in accordance with a first rule and calculates the corrected value of the torque, applied to the specific wheelset, in accordance with a second rule different from the first rule.
