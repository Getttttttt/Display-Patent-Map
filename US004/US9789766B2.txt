abstract
    A method and arrangement for operating a motor vehicle having a vehicle electrical system having a semiconductor switch, which during the vehicle operation is loaded with load events based on at least one load-influencing factor, and for which a service life load relationship is predefined, for a nominal service life for a nominal load, and with which for at least one point in time within the nominal service life a nominal load proportion corresponding to the at least one point in time is ascertainable, and the method for the at least one point in time including ascertaining an actual load of the semiconductor switch based on establishing past load events at the at least one point in time, the ascertaining of the nominal load proportion corresponding to the at least one point in time with the predefined service life load relationship, and comparing of the actual and nominal load proportion at the at least one point in time and the reducing of the at least one load-influencing factor when the actual load exceeds the nominal load proportion by more than a predefined tolerance value at the at least one point in time.
