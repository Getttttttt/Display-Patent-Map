abstract
    An on-vehicle travel distance output apparatus for a vehicle is disclosed. The vehicle including a battery and a travel motor that generate, based on electric power of the battery, a drive force for the travel of the vehicle, wherein the battery is chargeable based on electric power from a first charge source as well as electric power from a second charge source. The on-vehicle travel distance output apparatus includes a processing device that calculates a first travel distance of the vehicle over which the vehicle travels based on the electric power of the battery obtained from the first charge source and a second travel distance of the vehicle over which the vehicle travels based on the electric power of the battery obtained from the second charge source to output the calculated first and second travel distances.
