abstract
    A system and method are provided for a compressed air energy storage (CAES) system. The system and method may include compressing a process gas with a compressor train to produce a compressed process gas. The compressed process gas may be directed to a compressed gas storage unit and stored therein. The compressed process gas from the compressed gas storage unit may be released to a heat recovery unit via a feed line. The heat recovery unit may heat the compressed process gas and direct the heated compressed process gas to an expansion assembly to generate a power output. Feed water from a feed water source may be heated in the heat recovery unit to produce steam for injection into a combustion turbine assembly. The combustion turbine assembly may heat the heat recovery unit via an exhaust line.
