abstract
    Power systems, heat exchanger systems, electrical regeneration systems and air drag reduction systems for a wheeled vehicle are provided. The systems comprise a vehicle that includes a compressed air system and electrical system. The power and drag reduction system also comprises a plurality of pneumatic motors, one each connected to each wheel, the pneumatic motors using compressed air to drive each wheel and a plurality of electric motors, two each connected to each wheel, the electric motors using electric power to drive each wheel. Based on operator action, the vehicle is propelled by one of compressed air system operation and electrical system operation. Motors associated with each of the compressed air system and electrical system are attached to and drive each wheel separately. The compressed air system and electrical system operate separately and recharge battery systems.
