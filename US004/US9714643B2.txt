abstract
    The boiling-water geothermal heat exchanger 1 is provided with a water injection pipe 2 which is installed underground and to which water is supplied from the ground and a steam extraction pipe 3 which is installed underground so as to be in contact with the water injection pipe 2 and has a plurality of ejection ports 5, in which a pressure inside the steam extraction pipe 3 is reduced to the vicinity of a pressure required by a turbine 6, high-pressure hot water which is produced by supplying heat from a geothermal region 4 to water inside the water injection pipe 2 is changed to a single-phase flow of steam inside the steam extraction pipe 3 present underground via the ejection ports 5, and the single-phase flow of steam is extracted on the ground. And in the boiling-water geothermal heat exchanger 1, a heat insulation portion is formed at a part which is in contact with a low-temperature region close to the ground surface, and the heat insulation portion is such that the level of water supplied to the water injection pipe 2 is lowered to form an air layer at an upper part of the water injection pipe 2.
