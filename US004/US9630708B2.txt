abstract
    An aircraft landing gear wheel-drive system includes a first wheel drive unit for driving a first landing gear wheel of the aircraft and a second wheel drive unit for driving a second landing gear wheel of the aircraft. The first wheel drive unit has a first range of torque to speed (T/S) ratios. The second wheel drive unit has a second range of T/S ratios. The first range of T/S ratios is greater than the second range of T/S ratios.
