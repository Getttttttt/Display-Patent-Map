abstract
    A braking control method of an eco-friendly vehicle includes calculating, if a braking manipulation performed by a driver is sensed, a motor torque command according to a regenerative braking permissible amount. If it is determined that a motor has been normally driven, a regenerative braking execution amount is calculated from the motor torque command. Motor control for regenerative braking is performed according to the motor torque command. A friction braking amount satisfying the total braking amount is calculated from the regenerative braking execution amount according to the braking manipulation performed by the driver, thereby controlling friction braking to generate braking power corresponding to the friction braking amount.
