abstract
    A 12 volt automotive battery system includes a first battery coupled to an electrical system, in which the first battery includes a first battery chemistry. The first battery is charged with a relatively constant first voltage, in which an alternator outputs the relatively constant first voltage. The 12 volt automotive battery system further includes a second battery coupled in parallel with the first battery and selectively coupled to the electrical system via a DC/DC converter, in which the second battery includes a second battery chemistry that has a higher coulombic efficiency than the first battery chemistry. The DC/DC converter boosts the first voltage to a second voltage to charge the second battery during regenerative braking, in which the second voltage is higher than a maximum charging voltage of the first battery.
