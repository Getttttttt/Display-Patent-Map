abstract
    An electric vehicle driven by a synchronous motor 21 and an induction motor 31, and braked with a first regenerative torque BT1 generated by the synchronous motor generator 21 and a second regenerative torque BT2 generated by the induction motor generator 31. The ratio of the first regenerative torque BT1 to the second regenerative torque BT2 is changed in accordance with a state of charge (SOC) of a battery 11. In this way, a switching frequency from a regenerative brake to a hydraulic brake is restricted to improve drivability when a state of charge (SOC) of the battery 11 is high.
