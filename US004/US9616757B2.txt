abstract
    A method and apparatus for controlling regenerative braking of a vehicle are provided. The method of controlling regenerative braking of a vehicle includes: receiving information regarding the scheduled driving route from a path information providing device, estimating a regenerable segment based on the information regarding the scheduled driving route and calculating a regenerable energy amount based on the regenerable segment, calculating a dischargeable energy amount based on the regenerable energy amount and setting a dischargeable segment and a discharge control amount based on the dischargeable energy amount, controlling discharge of a battery based on the discharge control amount at the dischargeable segment and measuring an actually discharged actual discharge energy amount; and controlling regenerative braking of a battery based on a regeneration control amount at the regenerable segment and measuring actually regenerated entire regeneration energy amount.
