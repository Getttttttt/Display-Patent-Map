abstract
    A dehumidifier comprises: a first channel for transporting air at a first pressure; a second channel for transporting air at a second pressure lower than the first pressure; and a graphene oxide barrier separating the first channel and the second channel. The relatively lower pressure of air in the second channel causes water vapor to be drawn out of the air in the first channel.
