abstract
    A heat recovery system has an evaporator in which a working medium is evaporated, an expander by means of which energy from the working medium in vapor form is made usable, a recuperator operating as an internal heat exchanger, a condenser that condenses the working medium in vapor form, and a pump to move the working medium through a circuit. At least one plate heat exchanger with flow channels formed in interspaces between the heat exchanger plates is provided as a component of the system and includes at least the recuperator and the condenser.
