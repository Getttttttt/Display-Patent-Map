abstract
    A control device for a recuperative braking system of a vehicle includes: an actuating device configured to (i) select the maximum value of a front axle generator braking torque and of a rear axle generator braking torque, taking into account at least one provided default variable concerning a setpoint total braking torque which is predefined by a driver, (ii) control an electric motor, and (iii) control a hydraulic front axle brake circuit component and a hydraulic rear axle brake circuit component in such a way that a front axle brake pressure and a rear axle brake pressure are settable in such a way that a difference between a predefined setpoint braking torque distribution and an actual braking torque distribution present between the front axle and the rear axle is minimized.
