abstract
    An exhaust heat recovery device 1, with a Rankine cycle for recovering and using exhaust heat of an engine 10 includes: a Rankine cycle 2 including a heater 22, an expander 23, a condenser 24, and a pump 25; a bypass flow passage 26 allowing the refrigerant to circulate while bypassing the expander 23; a bypass valve 27 opening and closing the bypass flow passage 26; and a control unit 4. When starting up the Rankine cycle 2, the control unit 4 executes start-up control of the Rankine cycle 2 in which the pump 25 is actuated with the bypass valve 27 open and then the bypass valve 27 is closed. Furthermore, the control unit 4 repeatedly executes the start-up control when the pressure difference between the high-pressure side and the low-pressure side of the Rankine cycle 2 after closing the bypass valve 27 does not reach the start-up completion determination value within a predetermined time.
