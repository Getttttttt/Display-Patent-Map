abstract
    To start a combined cycle thermal plant for energy-production from an off-state to an operational state, once the minimum warm-up time of the steam turbine (ST) having been set, as well as the pressure of the warm-up steam, it is necessary to determine the steam optimum temperature to avoid stressing or straining the mechanical parts of the turbine itself.
