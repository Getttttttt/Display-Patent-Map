abstract
    A drivable exercise machine may include an electric vehicle with human power input provided by a high output, variable-resistance pedal-driven generator. The vehicle may include a computing device with a user interface that mimics an electric exercise bicycle. Using one or more program modes, a user may activate pre-set, custom and dynamic terrain-based exercise program profiles while commuting.
