abstract
    A vehicle includes a regenerative braking system, which may include an electric machine, configured to provide regenerative braking torque to vehicle traction wheels. The vehicle further includes at least one controller configured to provide indicia for display to indicate performance of the regenerative braking system. The indicia represent a comparison of a braking profile that is recorded during a deceleration event and a calculated braking profile that is based on a detected forward object. In various embodiments, the indicia may include a numerical or letter grade representative of a similarity between the recorded braking profile and the calculated braking profile and/or a visual representation of the comparison of the recorded braking profile and the calculated braking profile.
