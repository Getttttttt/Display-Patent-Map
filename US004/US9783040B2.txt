abstract
    A drive wheel having an electric wheel hub motor for a motor vehicle includes a stator arranged around a wheel hub and is connected to the wheel hub in a non-rotatable manner. A rotor is mounted in such a manner that it can rotate relative to the stator to drive a wheel rim connected to the rotor in a non-rotatable manner. At least two energy storage devices are arranged between the wheel hub and the stator to output electrical energy for operation of the electric wheel hub motor. The energy storage devices are embodied in each case in the shape of a ring segment in such a manner that the energy storage devices form a closed ring around the wheel hub when lying adjacent to one another.
