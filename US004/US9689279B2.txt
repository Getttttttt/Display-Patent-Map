abstract
    A cogeneration system for generating electricity and process steam. The system includes an internal combustion engine having a shaft and a cooling system comprising a cooling fluid adapted to circulate through the engine and to cool the engine under conditions of nucleate boiling in which at least 10 percent of the coolant exits the engine in a vapor phase. It includes a vapor separator adapted to separate the coolant that exits the engine into a vapor phase coolant and a liquid phase coolant. The engine shaft drives an electric generator to provide electric power. A hot vapor line directs hot vapor exiting the vapor separator to a hot vapor process load. A coolant circulation pump is provided to force the cooling fluid through the engine, and a hot water line is provided to return hot water exiting the vapor separator to the coolant circulation pump. In preferred embodiments the system further includes an excess steam condenser for to collecting and condensing excess steam not needed by the hot vapor load, a condensate return tank adapted to store condensate from the hot vapor load and the excess steam condenser, and a condensate return line adapted to return condensate to the coolant recirculation pump.
