abstract
    A battery system comprises plural battery cells, a voltage detecting circuit detecting voltage of each of the battery cells, and plural voltage detecting lines connecting an electrode terminal of each of the battery cells to input side of the voltage detecting circuit, and the voltage detecting circuit detects the voltage of each of the battery cells through the voltage detecting lines. The voltage detecting lines have different lengths, and at least one of the voltage detecting lines has a resistance adjusting portion which equalizes electrical resistances of the long voltage detecting line and the short voltage detecting line, and through the plural voltage detecting lines of which electrical resistances are equalized by the resistance adjusting portion, the voltage detecting circuit detects the voltage of each of the battery cells.
