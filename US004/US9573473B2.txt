abstract
    In a vehicle control device, a slip ratio in which front and rear wheels are averaged, and a braking force in which the front and rear wheels are averaged, can be calculated. The vehicle control device is provided with: friction braking devices placed on each wheel; a motor that acts as a regenerative braking mechanism and is placed on the rear wheels; a vehicle slip stiffness calculation unit; a front and rear braking force ratio calculation unit; a vehicle slip stiffness correction unit; and a regenerative braking arithmetic unit. The regenerative braking arithmetic unit operates the friction braking device and the motor so as to make the vehicle slip stiffness reach a vehicle slip stiffness threshold value. Also, the vehicle slip stiffness correction unit corrects the vehicle slip stiffness threshold value in accordance with the ratio of the front wheel braking force and the rear wheel braking force.
