abstract
    Utilization of mine methane produced by mining a non-combustible ore, such as trona, as an energy source for heat, steam, and/or power generation. Such utilization is beneficial for a surface appliance which is close to surface outlet(s) of mine methane recovery system(s). A method for reducing greenhouse gas emissions generated during mining of a non-combustible ore uses the combustion of co-produced mine methane. The mine methane is recovered in a mine ventilation air exhaust with very low methane content, and may be additionally recovered in a drainage gas, such as gob gas, with much higher methane content. The surface appliance may be selected from the group consisting of calciner, dryer, boiler, kiln, furnace, engine, turbine, power generation unit, co-generation unit, and any combinations thereof. Benefits may include reduction in energy purchases, reduction in greenhouse emissions, and/or gain through sale of carbon credits to the carbon market by registering carbon reductions.
