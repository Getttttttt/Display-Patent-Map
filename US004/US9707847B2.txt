abstract
    A hybrid vehicle includes a braking device configured to apply a frictional braking torque to a vehicle wheel in response to movement of an input member of a brake pedal, an electric motor configured to apply a regenerative braking torque to the vehicle wheel, and a control unit. During braking, the control unit is configured to determine a limit value of the regenerative braking torque that can be generated in accordance with an operating condition of the charging device or the electric motor, and reduce a ratio of the regenerative braking torque to the frictional braking torque before the regenerative braking torque reaches the limit value.
