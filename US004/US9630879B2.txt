abstract
    The invention relates to a method and a system for producing cement clinker from raw cement mixture, wherein one part of the raw cement mixture is preheated in a calciner preheater, and the other part of the raw cement mixture is preheated in an oven preheater, the preheated raw cement mixture is pre-calcined in a calciner which is operated according to the oxyfuel method, the pre-calcined raw cement mixture is fired in an oven, the fired raw cement mixture is cooled in a cooler, the calciner preheater is operated using exhaust gases of the calciner, the oven preheater is operated using exhaust gases of the oven, an entrained flow reactor is used as the calciner, a part of the calciner exhaust gas being recirculated to the calciner after being used in the calciner preheater, and the oven exhaust gas undergoes a post-combustion CO2 separation.
