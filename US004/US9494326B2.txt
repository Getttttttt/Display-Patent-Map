abstract
    An apparatus for heating a liquid includes: a mixing chamber; dispensing means; an electronic control device linked to the dispensing means; one or more pumps; a heat exchanger; one or more monitoring stations being arranged to communicate with the electronic control device; a waste outlet; and a second heat exchanger, wherein the mixing chamber, heat exchanger and the one or more monitoring stations are connected so as to form a loop; and wherein the electronic control device is programmed to cause reaction mixture to be circulated around the loop at least twice, and optionally to cause the dispensing means to dispense further metered amounts of first and/or second chemical reactants into the mixing chamber; and/or to cause a proportion of reaction mixture to be ejected through the waste outlet, in order to control the temperature of the reaction mixture passing through the heat exchanger.
