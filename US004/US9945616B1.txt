abstract
    A fluid heating apparatus may comprise a fluid pumping assembly configured to increase a pressure characteristic of the fluid between the fluid inlet and fluid outlet, and a heating assembly configured to heat the fluid between the fluid inlet and the fluid outlet. The heating assembly may define a first portion of a gas path such that exhaust gases from combustion in the heating assembly enter the gas path. The apparatus may also comprise a heat recovery assembly configured to recover heat from the exhaust gases and transfer recovered heat to fluid moving through the fluid path. The heat recovery assembly may define a second portion of the gas path in fluid communication with the first portion of the gas path. An exhaust gas movement device may be configured to pull exhaust gases through the first and second portions of the gas path to the gas movement device.
