abstract
    Systems and methods for selectively producing steam from solar collectors and heaters are disclosed. A method in accordance with a particular embodiment includes directing a flow of water to a solar collector, directing the flow of water to a gas-fired heater, and, as a result of heating the flow of water at the solar collector and the gas-fired heater, forming steam from the flow of water. The method further includes changing a sequence by which at least a portion of the flow passes through the solar collector and the gas-fired heater.
