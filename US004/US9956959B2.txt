abstract
    A method for controlling a deceleration device of a motor vehicle, wherein a control apparatus receives a request signal from a vehicle component for vehicle deceleration. Protection against mistriggering of the deceleration device is provided. Also provided is an integrity level of the vehicle component to be ascertained, a time profile for a deceleration performance of the deceleration device obtained during a braking process to be ascertained, for different times, a respective current minimum integrity level that is at least necessary for the time profile ascertained hitherto to be ascertained, and performance limiting to be performed for the request signal if the current minimum integrity level is higher than the integrity level of the vehicle component.
