abstract
    A heat recovery system includes an engine coolant circuit and an exhaust gas recovery circuit. The engine coolant circuit uses an engine coolant fluid to cool an engine. The exhaust gas recovery circuit comprises a Rankine cycle system that uses a working fluid to convert heat from engine exhaust gases to energy. The engine coolant fluid comprises the working fluid such that the engine coolant circuit and an exhaust gas recovery circuit comprise a common circuit such that the Rankine cycle system recovers energy from exhaust gas heat and from engine coolant heat.
