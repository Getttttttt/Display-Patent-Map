abstract
    A device with a heat exchanger with a feed pipe for a medium leading from a medium inlet to the heat exchanger entrance and with a discharge pipe leading away from the heat exchanger exit is characterized in that it has a first bypass from the medium inlet to the discharge pipe and a second bypass from the feed pipe to the medium outlet and valves, so that the medium can also flow from the heat exchanger exit to the heat exchanger entrance.
