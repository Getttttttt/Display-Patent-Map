abstract
    A system and method of generating steam comprising providing a continuous supply of coal, combusting the coal in a primary processing chamber in the presence of oxygen and water to provide a first product gas stream, recovering heat from the first product gas stream in a first heat recovery steam generator to produce a first steam output, processing the first product gas stream in a secondary processing chamber in the presence of oxygen and water to provide a second product gas stream, recovering heat from the second product gas stream in a second heat recovery steam generator to produce a second steam output, and combining the first steam output and the second steam output. Preferably, the combined steam output is used to drive a steam turbine and the turbine is coupled to a generator.
