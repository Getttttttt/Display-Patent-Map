abstract
    A regenerative brake device for a vehicle includes a manual brake configured to apply a brake to a wheel of the vehicle by a manual operation of a brake lever; a motor configured to be coupled to a wheel of the vehicle, the motor being driven by a power from a battery, and also alternatively acting as a regenerative brake that charges the battery with an electromotive force of the motor; a brake sensor that detects a manual brake application point at which the manual brake is actuated from an operation amount of the brake lever; and a power control unit that performs regenerative power control for charging the battery with the electromotive force of the motor based on an output signal from the brake sensor so that the regenerative brake is generated in accordance with the operation amount of the brake lever.
