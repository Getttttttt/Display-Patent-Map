abstract
    A water heater includes a burner generating combustion gas, a heat exchanger heating water which flows through the inside, through heat exchange with combustion gas generated in the burner, a fan supplying air to the burner, and a housing storing these components. The water heater has a water entry portion in a top plate of the housing. A water supply pipe for supplying water to the inside of the heat exchanger is connected to the water entry portion. The water entry portion is arranged to be included, in a plane view, in at least one component constituting the heat exchanger and an exhaust path for combustion gas which has passed through the heat exchanger. The component is made of a material having corrosion resistance against drainage water resulting from condensation of combustion gas.
