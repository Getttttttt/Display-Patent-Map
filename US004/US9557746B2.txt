abstract
    A system and method for vehicle energy management are described that take driving context into account to derive suggested vehicle control inputs to reduce energy consumption. Driving context may be based on information including, for example, traffic congestion and/or flow information for a traveled route, road topology information, traffic controls, weather conditions, vehicle characteristics, and other types of driving context information. The driving context may be used to derive suggested control inputs to reduce energy consumption. The suggested control inputs can, for example, be expressed as: a suggested road speed, suggested gear selection, rate of acceleration or rate of deceleration.
