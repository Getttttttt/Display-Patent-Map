abstract
    An air conditioner controlling method includes: deciding on a supply-air temperature Ts and a return-air temperature Tr as specified design values; deciding that the total heat-exchange efficiency η is zero; selecting two or more stepped levels of the outdoor-air volume percentage α; deriving a linear function which expresses a relation between an outdoor-air temperature To and a mixed-air temperature Tm for each level of the outdoor-air volume percentage α by using the return-air temperature Tr and the total heat-exchange efficiency η; and deciding on the range where the mixed-air temperature Tm is lower than the supply-air temperature Ts for each of the linear functions and the range where the mixed-air temperature Tm in each linear function comes closest to the supply-air temperature Ts as compared with the mixed-air temperatures Tm in the other linear functions.
