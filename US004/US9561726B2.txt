abstract
    A method for calculating a regenerative braking amount of a hybrid electric vehicle includes calculating a first possible available charging power of a motor when regenerative braking of the hybrid electric vehicle is required; calculating a second possible charging power of the motor by using the first possible charging power of the motor; converting the second possible charging power of the motor to a torque of a wheel axle; calculating an available amount of regenerative braking by reflecting a coasting torque on the torque of the wheel axle; generating a motor torque command based on the available amount of regenerative braking; and calculating a final regenerative braking amount by monitoring a real motor torque according to the motor torque command and correcting an error.
