abstract
    The present invention becomes possible to employ a main microprocessor with a relatively lower number of input ports, whereby while maintaining the performance and function of a water heater, the cost of a control apparatus is cut down. Some of sensors, adapted for measurement of various parameters which are for use in operational control of the water heater and in need of immediate response, are connected to a main microprocessor 31. The other sensors that are not in need of an immediate response, such as an ambient temperature sensor 36, are connected only to a sub microprocessor 32 if the main microprocessor 31 does not have any extra analog signal input port. The sub microprocessor converts an analog signal from the sensor 36 which is connected only to the sub microprocessor into digital data. And the sub microprocessor transmits the digital data to the main microprocessor through communication therewith.
