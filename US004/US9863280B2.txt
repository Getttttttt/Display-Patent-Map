abstract
    A CHP system includes a combustor (heat source), a Rankine cycle apparatus, and a second heat exchanger. The Rankine cycle apparatus includes, as an evaporator, a first heat exchanger that absorbs thermal energy produced in the combustor. The second heat exchanger is located closer to the combustor than is the evaporator, absorbs thermal energy produced in the combustor, and transfers the thermal energy to a heat medium.
