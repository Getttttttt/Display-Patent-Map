abstract
    A movement control device for a vehicle comprises a yaw-acceleration calculation portion to calculate a target yaw acceleration of the vehicle, a turn-back steering determination portion to determine whether a turn-back steering of the vehicle is conducted or not, and a drive-force control portion to a drive force of the vehicle. The control of the drive-force control portion is configured such that when the turn-back steering is not conducted, the amount of drive-force decreasing is increased with a specified increasing rate as the target yaw acceleration increases, the specified increasing rate becoming smaller as the target yaw acceleration increases, and when the turn-back steering is conducted, the drive force is increased in a case in which an absolute value of a steering angle of the vehicle decreases.
