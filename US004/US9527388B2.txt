abstract
    A regenerative control capable of realizing a comfortable operation, along with an efficient collection of a regenerative energy of a motor generator and an effective regenerative braking control. A regenerative control device for a motor generator generates a regenerative braking power for decelerating a motor vehicle at a time of collecting regenerative energy generated by driving of the motor vehicle. The arrangement includes a driving state detection unit for detecting a driving state and a deceleration level acquisition unit for acquiring a deceleration level. A braking force setting unit sets the regenerative braking force of the motor generator at a time of detection of a deceleration operation by the driving state detection unit. A braking force adjustment unit adjusts and suppresses the regenerative braking force set by the braking force setting unit, according to acquired deceleration level.
