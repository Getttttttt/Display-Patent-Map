abstract
    An engine cooling system, capable of reducing vehicle weight caused by employing a Rankine cycle and capable of improving Rankine cycle performance, including some inlet-side cooling water of a radiator is used as a heating source for a first evaporator and some outlet-side cooling water of a sub-radiator is used as a cooling source for a condenser, a coolant that has passed through an expander, a second evaporator, and a compressor in a cooling cycle for an air conditioner, vaporized, cooled and liquefied by passing through a side to be cooled of the condenser in the Rankine cycle.
