abstract
    A system for charging an electrical storage device includes a motor drive, a DC link electrically coupled to the motor drive, and a first leg coupled to the DC link that includes a first power switch coupled in series with a second power switch via a first node. A first inductor is coupled to the first node, and a first energy storage device (ESD) is electrically coupled to the first inductor. A second leg is coupled to the DC link that includes a third power switch coupled in series with a fourth power switch via a second node. A charging circuit includes a transformer coupled to the first and second nodes. A second ESD is coupled to receive charging energy from the transformer, and a controller is configured to cause a first voltage mismatch between the first and second nodes to generate the charging energy.
