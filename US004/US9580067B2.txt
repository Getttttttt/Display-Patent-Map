abstract
    Charging/discharging control system for an electricity storage device includes motor/generator, electricity storage device, AC/DC conversion unit for performing AC/DC conversion processing between the AC power of motor/generator and the DC power of electricity storage device, and control device for controlling the charge and discharge of electricity storage device via AC/DC conversion unit. During charge control, in accordance with the charge state of electricity storage device, control device restricts the magnitude of the DC power that is obtained by converting the generation power generated by the regenerative braking of motor/generator at the deceleration and is supplied to electricity storage device.
