abstract
    In one or more of the inventive aspects, when a gas turbine system of a power plant operates at part load, a moisture content of fuel gas provided to the gas turbine system may be controlled so as to minimize combustion dynamics and/or to comply with emission requirements. The fuel gas moisture content may be controlled by modulating a flow of heated water to a fuel moisturizer. By using heated water from a heat recovery steam generator to moisturize the fuel gas, heat energy from the water may be transferred to the fuel gas, and the overall mass flow may be enhanced to thereby increase overall combined cycle efficiency.
