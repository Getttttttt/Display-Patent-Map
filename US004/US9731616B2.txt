abstract
    An electric locomotive includes a first control line and DC buses laid between couplers, a power storage device connected to the DC buses, and a DC/DC converter that executes charge and discharge control with respect to the power storage device. A non-powered vehicle includes DC buses connected to the DC buses via a coupler, a second control line, a power storage device connected to the DC buses via a circuit breaker, and a BMU that manages the power storage device. The DC/DC converter executes power accumulation control with respect to the power storage device and power accumulation control with respect to the power storage device. When having determined abnormality of the power storage device, the BMU controls the circuit breaker to be turned off, thereby cutting off electrical connection between the power storage device and the DC buses.
