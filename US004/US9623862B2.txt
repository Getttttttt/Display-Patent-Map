abstract
    In a control device, a control unit controls at least one switching element of a converter to increase a voltage supplied from a battery, thus outputting the increased voltage to a rotating electrical machine. The rotating electrical machine is capable of driving, based on the increased voltage output from the converter, an internal combustion engine, and capable of charging the battery based on torque supplied from the internal combustion engine. A limit unit limits, based on a change of an available maximum output of the internal combustion engine, the increased voltage output from the converter to be equal to or lower than a predetermined upper limit.
