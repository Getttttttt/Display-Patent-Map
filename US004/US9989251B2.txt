abstract
    The invention provides a system for reducing the volume of bulk material, comprising a transportable container; a single chamber adapted to receive said transportable container; a means for establishing a plurality of controlled atmospheres within said chamber; a plurality of electrically-charged heating elements capable of heating said chamber to at least 1200 F; and an waste heat generator in fluid communication with the chamber. A method for simultaneously thermally degrading different waste differently in a single chamber, comprising filling each container within a plurality of containers with preselected waste and placing each container within the chamber at preselected positions; establishing a controlled atmosphere within the chamber and applying heat to the waste for a time and at a temperature sufficient to gasify the waste; collecting thermal degradation data during gasification; and applying the collected data to an algorithm to adjust the temperature and oxygen concentrations for each preselected position.
