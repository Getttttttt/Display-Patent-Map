abstract
    A novel processed vapor make-up water subsystem that uses a make-up water boiler to boil and purify make-up water and its method of use are described. Upon vaporization, dissolved solids remain in the liquid water in the bottom of the make-up boiler and the solids free steam is introduced into the main boiler loop through a deaerator. Periodically, the water in the bottom of the make-up boiler is blown down when the amount of dissolved solids in the water reach a predetermined level.
