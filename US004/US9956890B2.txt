abstract
    An electric vehicle includes a motor, an ECU, and an inverter device. A motor control module of the inverter device includes: a parameter map having motor parameters stored therein; an open loop control section to generate control variables in open loop control by a voltage equation using the parameters stored in the parameter map, in response to a torque command from the ECU; a current feedback control section to perform control to eliminate a deviation relative to a command current value generated in an inverter, in response to the torque command from the ECU; and a hybrid control section to control the motor on the basis of control variables which are generated on the basis of the control variables generated by the open loop control section and control variables generated by the current feedback control section.
