abstract
    Systems and methods for air conditioning a building using an energy recovery wheel are provided. An exemplary system includes a rotatable energy recovery wheel configured to rotate successively through a recirculated air stream and a second air stream separate from the recirculated air stream, and a refrigeration circuit configured to circulate a refrigerant through a cooling coil arranged in the recirculated air stream and a condenser arranged in the second air stream. The refrigeration circuit includes a pressure sensor configured to measure a condensing head pressure. The system further includes one or more temperature sensors configured to measure a temperature of the recirculated air stream upstream of the energy recovery wheel and downstream of the energy recovery wheel, and a controller configured to operate the energy recovery wheel and the refrigeration circuit based on the condensing head pressure and the temperatures of the recirculated air stream.
