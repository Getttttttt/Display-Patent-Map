abstract
    An electricity generation unit 1A includes a combustor 11, a heater 13, and a Rankine cycle circuit 20. The combustor 11 combusts a solid fuel. A combustion gas generated in the combustor 11 passes through a flue 12. The heater 13 contains a heat storage material, and heats the heat storage material by allowing heat exchange to take place between the combustion gas in the flue 12 and the heat storage material. The Rankine cycle circuit 20 has an evaporator 21 that evaporates a working fluid in the Rankine cycle by allowing heat exchange to take place between the heat storage material heated in the heater 13 and the working fluid. With this configuration, stable operation of an electricity generation unit using a combustion gas of a solid fuel is achieved.
