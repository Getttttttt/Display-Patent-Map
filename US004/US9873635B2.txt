abstract
    In a device for baking of clinker, heat generated in a furnace can be used in a particularly efficient and versatile manner if the heat generated in the furnace is transferred, by means of at least one first heat exchanger, to a heat carrier fluid, the heated heat carrier fluid is transported to at least one second heat exchanger, and the heat is then discharged to a heat sink, for example, in order to heat a flow of flue gas to a temperature required for denitrification thereof.
