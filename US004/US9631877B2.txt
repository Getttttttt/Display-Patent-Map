abstract
    A coupling to connect a primary heat exchanger to a condensing heat exchanger of a furnace includes a coupling box extending between a primary heat exchanger and a condensing heat exchanger. The coupling box defines a flow path for flue gas between a primary heat exchanger outlet and a condensing heat exchanger inlet. A tube sheet is located at a distance from the tube sheet in the coupling box. The liner and the tube sheet define an insulating liner space therebetween reducing condensation on the liner.
