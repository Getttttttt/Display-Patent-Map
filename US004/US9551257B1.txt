abstract
    An exhaust aftertreatment system may include an aftertreatment component and thermoelectric generators. The aftertreatment component is disposed in an exhaust gas passageway. The thermoelectric generators may be disposed in the exhaust gas passageway upstream or downstream of the aftertreatment component. Each of the thermoelectric generators may have a catalytic coating and may include a radially extending fin configured to absorb heat from exhaust gas in the exhaust gas passageway. The fin of at least one of the thermoelectric generators may overlap the fin of at least another one of the thermoelectric generators.
