abstract
    A system for controlling a mode of operation of a vehicle having a rechargeable energy storage system (RESS), an engine, and a drive motor coupled to the RESS and the engine, the drive motor selectively powered by at least one of the RESS and the engine includes a controller operable to adjust the vehicle to operate in a plurality of operating modes including a first mode in which the drive motor is powered by the RESS, a second mode in which the drive motor is powered more by the engine than the RESS. When the second mode of operation is selected, controller is configured to operate the engine as necessary to maintain the RESS at or above a predetermined state of charge.
