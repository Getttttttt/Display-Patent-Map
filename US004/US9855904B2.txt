abstract
    A motor vehicle includes a generator, electric consuming devices, a first electric energy storage device and a second energy storage device connected in parallel with the first energy storage device. The two electric energy storage devices, in a storage range, have at least partially overlapping characteristic open-circuit voltage curves. The first energy storage device has a first state-of-charge-dependent characteristic charging internal-resistance curve. The second energy storage device has a second state-of-charge-dependent characteristic charging internal-resistance curve. The first energy storage device has a first state-of-charge-dependent characteristic discharging internal-resistance curve and the second energy storage device has a second state-of-charge-dependent characteristic discharging internal-resistance curve. The first characteristic charging internal-resistance curve extends over an entire relative state-of-charge range in the direction of higher resistances above the second characteristic charging internal-resistance curve. The first characteristic discharging internal-resistance curve extends over an entire relative state-of-charge range in the direction of higher resistances below the second characteristic discharging internal-resistance curve. The two energy storage devices are interconnected with one another in a voltage-neutral manner.
