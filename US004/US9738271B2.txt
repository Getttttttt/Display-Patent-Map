abstract
    A method for controlling a hybrid electric powertrain includes, in response to a request to increase a powertrain braking force on at least one of a plurality of traction wheels, (i) commanding at least one clutch to increase a gear ratio of a transmission, and (ii) during clutch stroke, commanding an electric machine to act as a generator such that the electric machine applies a braking force to at least one of the traction wheels.
