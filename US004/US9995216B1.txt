abstract
    A disc turbine engine includes a multi disc engine in which each disc engine includes a turbine blade, and low-pressure compressor blade, a high-pressure compressor blade and a bearing that runs the disc engine freely around a shaft. Each disc engine has its own cooling system, the compressor's blades act as cooling fins for the turbine blade, and air bleeding from the high-pressure compressor to the lower pressure compressor through a hollow turbine blade. Cooling the nozzle is by attaching the nozzle to the guide fan and by air bleeding through the hollow body. There is no stator in between the disc engine and no large shaft is required because the power produced by each turbine blade is consumed by its own compressor. The weight and cost of this engine will be less than other engines at the same thrust output.
