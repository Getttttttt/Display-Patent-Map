abstract
    A vehicle brake control system includes an inverter configured to convert direct current (DC) into an alternating current (AC) for a motor of a vehicle. The inverter includes switches configured to convert the DC to the AC, as well as a resistor and a bypass switch disposed in series with each other. A controller is communicatively coupled with the inverter switches and the bypass switch. The controller opens the bypass switch so that the DC is conducted through and converted into the AC for the motor during a motoring mode. The controller closes the bypass switch so that regenerated current from the motor is conducted through the resistor of the inverter for partial dissipation of the regenerated current during a dynamic braking mode.
