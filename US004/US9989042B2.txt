abstract
    A hydraulic circuit architecture for a work vehicle includes a pump, a work circuit, a propel circuit, and a circuit selector. The work circuit is connected to an actuator for driving a work component of the work vehicle. The propel circuit includes a motor that is adapted to be connected to a drive train of the work vehicle. The propel circuit also includes an accumulator. The circuit selector selectively connects the pump to the work circuit and the propel circuit. The hydraulic circuit architecture is operable in a first mode and a second mode. In the first mode, the propel circuit is connected to the pump and the work circuit is disconnected from the pump. In the second mode, the work circuit is connected to the pump and the propel circuit is disconnected from the pump. When the hydraulic circuit architecture is in the second mode, stored energy from the accumulator can be used to drive the motor to cause propulsion of the work vehicle.
