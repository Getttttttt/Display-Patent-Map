abstract
    A novel nested heat transfer system comprises a plurality of chained enhanced entrochemical cells with nested structures. Each enhanced entrochemical cell includes a first chamber containing desiccant, or a higher concentration solution, and a second chamber containing refrigerant, or a lower concentration solution. Preferably, the first chamber and the second chamber are connected by a conduit. Furthermore, a smaller chamber in an enhanced entrochemical cell is encapsulated by a larger chamber in an adjacent enhanced entrochemical cell, thus forming a nested structure between the two enhanced entrochemical cells. A chain of enhanced entrochemical cells with a plurality of such nested structures is conveniently modular and scalable. For the novel nested heat transfer system, the total systemic thermal gradient is the sum of individual thermal gradients and capacity of individual enhanced entrochemical cells. This design provides highly-versatile and high-capacity refrigeration and thermal transfer systems, while exhibiting an elegant design simplicity.
