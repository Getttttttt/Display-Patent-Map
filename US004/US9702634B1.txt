abstract
    Energy systems in different industrial applications including automotive applications experience between 20 to 50 percent of raw energy input as waste heat. in the form of hot exhaust gases, hot cooling water and lost heat from hot equipment surfaces including heated products. Continued efforts to improve systems energy efficiency, recovering waste heat losses provide attractive opportunities for reduced emission and less costly energy resources. This invention introduces other methods for higher performance of existing energy consuming systems by optimizing the performance of some of the system modules that contributes to the waste energy. in turn reduce energy consumption of these systems, reduces its operating cost, damages to the population health by reducing pollution improving the environment quality, and also reduces the cost of health care. Improving efficiency of the module's' which contribute large percentage of waste energy as by-product from the operation of these systems can improve the system efficiency.
