abstract
    A waste heat utilization device for a motor vehicle includes a waste heat utilization circuit in which a working medium circulates. The water heat utilization circuit includes a conveying device, an evaporator, an expansion machine, and a condenser. The waste heat utilization device also includes an electrical generator in direct or indirect drive connection with a power take-off shaft of an internal combustion engine. The expansion machine is in direct drive connection with the power take-off shaft of the internal combustion engine for purposes of energy recirculation.
