abstract
    A includes a battery, an electric machine, an electrically powered cooling system, and a controller. The electric machine is configured to charge the battery with current generated from regenerative braking. The electrically powered cooling system is configured to cool the battery. The controller is programmed to, in response to a temperature of the battery being greater than a threshold, direct at least a portion of the current generated from regenerative braking to the cooling system.
