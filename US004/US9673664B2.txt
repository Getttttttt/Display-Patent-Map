abstract
    A power transmission apparatus includes a power transmission unit and a power supply unit. A wireless power reception apparatus includes a power reception unit capable of wirelessly receiving electric power from the power transmission unit, and a control unit performing control for positional alignment between the power reception unit and the power transmission unit and for reception of electric power after the positional alignment. The magnitude of electric power received by the power reception unit from the power transmission unit is used for positional alignment between the power reception unit and the power transmission unit. The control unit sets a parameter of a power transmission and reception path so that a power receivable range that can be received by the power reception unit at any time while positional alignment is done is wider than that when electric power is received after the positional alignment.
