abstract
    A hybrid vehicle mode-switching control device for a hybrid vehicle controls that an output of an engine and/or motor in response to a mode-switch request. In a case of a difference between an actual transmission gear ratio and a target transmission gear ratio, a deficit with respect to the requested drive power occurs that causes discomfort to the driver. The drive power surplus or deficit caused by the transmission gear ratio deviation can eliminated by correcting of the motor torque and/or the engine torque by a correction amount necessary to eliminate the surplus or deficit of drive power. In this way, the lack of drive power due to the transmission ratio deviation and the driver's sense of discomfort can be eliminated.
