abstract
    A hybrid vehicle includes an engine; a traction battery; and a controller or a vehicle control system having a controller. The controller is programmed to respond to a state of charge (SOC) of the traction battery. When the SOC is greater than a predicted SOC the controller is programmed to decrease a SOC threshold at which the engine is shut down to reduce the SOC. The SOC threshold is defined by a difference between a maximum SOC and an expected change in the SOC associated with predicted regenerative energy for a drive cycle.
