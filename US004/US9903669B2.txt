abstract
    Provided is a heat exchange element that suppresses an increase in air-flow resistance by suppressing deflection of a partition member caused by a change in temperature and humidity. The unit constituent members are stacked, each of which is formed of partition members that have heat-transfer properties and moisture permeability, and spacing members that hold the partition members. A primary air flow that passes along an upper-surface side of the partition member and a secondary air flow that passes along an undersurface side of the partition member cross each other so as to exchange heat and moisture via the partition member. The spacing member includes: spacing ribs that maintain the spacing between the partition members; and deflection suppressing ribs that have a height smaller than the spacing ribs so as to suppress deflection of the partition members.
