abstract
    A method for operating a regenerative braking system of a vehicle includes: applying control to at least one valve of a brake circuit, before and/or during operation of a generator of the braking system, so that brake fluid is displaced out of a brake master cylinder and/or out of the at least one brake circuit into at least one reservoir volume; defining a target force difference variable regarding a booster force exerted by a brake booster in consideration of at least one of a generator braking torque information item, a brake master cylinder pressure variable, and an evaluation variable derived from at least the generator braking torque information item or the brake master cylinder pressure variable; and controlling the brake booster in consideration of the defined target force difference variable.
