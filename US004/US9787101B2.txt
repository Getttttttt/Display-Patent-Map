abstract
    An electrical system for an aircraft with an electric taxi system (ETS), the electrical system may include at least one traction motor, a DC link and at least one traction-motor bidirectional DC-AC converter interposed between the at least one traction motor and the DC link. An engine-driven power source may be configured to provide DC power to the DC link or extract DC power from the DC link. A battery unit may be configured to provide DC power to the DC link or extract DC power from the DC link. An adaptive power controller may be interconnected with the power source, the battery unit and the at least one traction-motor bidirectional DC-AC converter and configured to regulate voltage of DC power delivered to the DC link.
