abstract
    An energy storage system of a vehicle includes an energy storage device, a regulation device coupled to the energy storage device, one or more sensing devices for sensing current levels, voltage levels, temperature levels, and/or pressure levels of the energy storage device and/or on components thereof, and a control unit configured to determine dynamically a power flow in/out of the energy storage device using a fuzzy logic approach. The regulation device is configured to regulate at least one of a voltage level, a current level, and any additional state parameter of the energy storage device.
