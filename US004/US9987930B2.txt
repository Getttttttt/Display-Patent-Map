abstract
    A railroad network (10) having a track (12), a network energy supply (14) and a plurality of trains (16) that are connectable to the network energy supply (14) via means (20) for connecting the train (16) to the network energy supply (14) and each have an internal energy storage system (24) for receiving and storing energy originating from said train (16) or from trains (16) of the railroad network (10) and for supplying energy to said train (16) or to trains (16) of the railroad network (10). Each train (16) is able to switch from an operational state in which it is able to move along the system of rails (12) and an idle state in which it is unable to move along the system of rails (12) and vice versa.
