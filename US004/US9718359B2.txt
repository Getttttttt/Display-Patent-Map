abstract
    A vehicle information display may include a split braking gauge for conveying information relating to braking operation and efficiency to assist drivers in maximizing energy capture during braking in vehicle with regenerative braking systems. The split braking gauge may incorporate a side-by-side or stacked configuration for conveying both regenerative braking and friction braking values. The split braking gauge may include fixed thresholds or boundaries associated with dynamic threshold values that can change based on current vehicle operating conditions.
