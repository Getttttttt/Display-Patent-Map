abstract
    A speed-command generating unit incorporated with an electric vehicle having a throttle module, a mechanical brake and a motor is disclosed and includes: a computation module for generating a computation value of a speed-command according to a throttle operating signal from the throttle module, a sensing module for detecting an activated status of the mechanical brake, a selecting module for providing a braking approach selecting signal, a trimming module for setting a trimming flag according to the activated status of the mechanical brake of last cycle, and a switching module connected therewith. The switching module generates different output values of the speed-command for the motor according to different foundations depending on the content of the trimming flag when the mechanical brake is inactivated in this cycle, and generates the output value according to the content of the braking approach selecting signal when the mechanical brake is activated in this cycle.
