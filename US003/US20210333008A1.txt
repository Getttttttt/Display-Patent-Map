abstract
    A heat exchanger including at least one bulb configured to generate a heat, and a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system incorporating the same are provided. The heat exchanger includes a body configured to permit the passage of an airflow through at least a portion of the body. The body includes at least one pocket with an interior surface. The pocket(s) may be configured in parallel or perpendicular to the passage of the airflow. The heat exchanger includes at least one bulb configured within at least one pocket. At least a portion of the heat generated by the bulb is transferred to at least a portion of the airflow. The pocket may allow the heat to be transferred to the airflow without the airflow contacting the bulb.
