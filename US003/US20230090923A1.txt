abstract
    A vehicle control system may be provided for controlling adhesion of wheels to a route surface. The control system includes one or more processors configured to determine adhesion values representative of adhesion between the wheels of a vehicle and the route surface based on angular speeds of the wheels. An artificial intelligence neural network may generate a target slip value for the wheels that are coupled with at least two different axles of the vehicle by processing the adhesion values and modifying the target slip value to increase an average value of the adhesion values of the wheels. The one or more processors may control a torque applied to at least one of the axles based on the target slip value.
