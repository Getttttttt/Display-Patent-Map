abstract
    A method for adjusting braking in a vehicle having wheels and a regenerative braking system is provided. The method comprises the steps of providing regenerative braking torque for the vehicle via the regenerative braking system at a first level if a wheel slip of the vehicle is not present, and providing regenerative braking torque for the vehicle via the regenerative braking system at one of a plurality of modulated levels if the wheel slip is present. Each of the plurality of modulated levels is dependent on a magnitude, a location, or both, of the wheel slip. Each of the modulated levels is less than the first level.
