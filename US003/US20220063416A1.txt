abstract
    A regenerative braking system of an automobile is disclosed. The system also includes an alternator, a plurality of supercapacitors and a power converter subsystem. The system also includes an automobile status sensing subsystem, which identifies a real time motion status of the automobile via one of an accelerometer and a pulse signal measurement. The power converter subsystem is operatively coupled to electrical system and the plurality of supercapacitors. The power converter subsystem transfers generated energy from the alternator and store the generated energy in the plurality of supercapacitors in an event of the braking of the automobile. The stored energy, which is stored in the supercapacitors, is slowly returned to the electrical systems of the automobile during idling, accelerating or running conditions.
