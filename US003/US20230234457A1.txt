abstract
    Disclosed is a Zero Emission Onboard Charging System that charges the main battery of an electric vehicle when the vehicle is being driven in full operation or is at rest. The Zero Emission Onboard Charging System includes at least one direct current (DC) belt driven generator, at least one wheel, at least one pulley attached to the at least one wheel and configured to be attached by belts to the at least one DC belt driven generator, the at least one DC belt driven generator being configured to be driven by the belts attached to the at least one pulley while the electric vehicle is being driven, a voltage regulator wired to the at least one DC belt driven generator, the voltage regulator being configured to regulate DC power received from the at least one DC belt driven generator and to output a grid-equivalent alternating current (AC) charge output, a charging box wired to the voltage regulator, the charging box being configured to receive the charge output from the voltage regulator, a charge cable having two ends configured with a plug, wherein a first end is plugged into the charging box, and wherein the charge cable is configured to receive the charge output from the charging box, a charge port connected to the charge cable by a second end of the charge cable being plugged into the charge port, the charge port being configured to receive the charge output through the charge cable, and a main battery wired to the charge port, the main battery being configured to receive the charge output from the charge port while the electric vehicle is being driven.
