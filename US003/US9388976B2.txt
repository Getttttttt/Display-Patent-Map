abstract
    A combustor including a housing, an injector body, insulation, an air/fuel premix injector, a hot surface igniter, a fuel injector and a burner. The housing forms a main combustion chamber. The injector body is coupled within the housing and the injector body includes an initial combustion chamber. The insulation lines the initial combustion chamber. The air/fuel premix injector is configured and arranged to dispense a flow of air/fuel mixture into the initial combustion chamber. The hot surface igniter is configured and arranged to heat up and ignite the air/fuel mixture in the initial combustion chamber. The fuel injector dispenses a flow of fuel and the burner dispenses a flow of air. The flow of fuel from the fuel injector and the flow of air from the burner are ignited in the main combustion chamber by the ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the initial combustion chamber.
