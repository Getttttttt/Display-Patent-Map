abstract
    Provided is a heat generating arrangement and a method for generation of heat to be used in a heat consumer. The heat generating arrangement uses combustion of aluminium and hydrogen to raise the temperature of superheated steam inside the heat generating arrangement. The heat in the superheated steam can thereafter be used in a heat consumer, such as a heat exchanger.
