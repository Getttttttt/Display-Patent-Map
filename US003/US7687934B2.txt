abstract
    A method and system for using a secondary energy source with an electric or hybrid vehicle in a way that requires no interaction with the vehicle's on-board communications system or the vehicle's processors. The secondary energy source, which can be a battery pack or any energy storage device, can generally be charged at home or business using the 110 volt line. The energy from the secondary source can be metered into the system in a way that allows the primary battery state-of-charge to fluctuate normally. Most of the electrical energy propelling the vehicle can come from the secondary source. All of the regenerative energy from braking can go into the primary battery. A controller can control a regulator to regulate the amount of current flowing from the secondary source.
