abstract
    An electric four-wheel drive (E-4WD) system and control method for a motor vehicle includes four wheel motors. Each wheel motor is an electric motor configured to drive one respective wheel corresponding to the wheel motor. Each wheel motor includes a stator implemented on a suspension structure of the respective wheel and a rotor implemented on a semi-axle connected to the respective wheel to rotate together with the respective wheel relative to the stator. The wheel motors are configured to drive the wheels independently of each other.
