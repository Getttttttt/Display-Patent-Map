abstract
    The present invention is a method and system for vertically producing a steam and combustion gas mixture, typically used in enhanced oil recovery processes. The system is a fluid bed up-flow combustor system, including a vertical vessel with fours sections. In a first section, fuel, oxidizer, and possibly water are supplied to the high pressure combustor at a combustion section of a vertical vessel. The combustion gas from the first section flows to a second section for steam generation, where low quality water is injected and turned into steam. Next, the third section is a homogenizer vessel, where any remaining water drops are converted to steam and solid particles and discharged from the vessel. The fourth section located at the bottom of the vessel is a fluid bed, receiving and processing the falling solids from the combustion and the steam generation sections.
