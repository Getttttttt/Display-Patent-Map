abstract
    Provided is a control device for a hybrid vehicle, which makes it possible to manually select a degree of acceleration in tune with user's preferences and user's intended running quality. Provided is a control device for a hybrid vehicle 1 including an engine and a motor for assisting the engine with power, in which an ECU 20 is provided with a first changing unit, which prepares to increase the assist amount of the motor 12 in response to a user depressing a Plus Sport mode switch 30, and subsequently increases the assist amount of the motor 12 in response to the user pressing an accelerator pedal to cause a variation ΔAP in an accelerator position to be at least a predetermined value.
