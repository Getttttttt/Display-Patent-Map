abstract
    A heat exchange system is disclosed which includes an air inlet, a membrane in fluid communication with the air inlet and adapted to have a partial vapor pressure difference across the membrane to thereby drive water vapor flux through the membrane, wherein the membrane is a selective membrane configured to allow passage of water vapor and block passage of air (O2/N2) through the membrane, where the membrane includes a thermally conductive side, a vacuum pump configured to generate the partial vapor pressure difference across the membrane, and a heat exchanger coupled to the thermally conductive side of the membrane configured to provide simultaneous mass and heat transfer.
