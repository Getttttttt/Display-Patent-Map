abstract
    A condensation tray for condensing tankless water heaters is disclosed. The tray can include a plurality of peaks and valleys. The peaks can divert condensate runoff from a secondary heat exchanger into the valleys so as to prevent the condensate from falling on a primary heat exchanger. The tray includes gas apertures that enable combustion gases to pass through the tray and across the secondary heat exchanger. Overhangs on the peaks can prevent the condensate from draining through the gas apertures.
