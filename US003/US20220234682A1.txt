abstract
    A duo-flex compact electrical platform for motorcycles which allows to obtain a mechanical power supply system for electric motorcycles with increased energy efficiency allied to an optimized mechanical power and torque delivery. The proposed platform has two electric motors horizontally arranged within a series of arrangements that also allow to obtain a kinematic solution with self-sufficiency that recharges itself through the use of one of the motors without overloading the other one.
