abstract
    A regenerative braking apparatus of a vehicle includes: an engine that supplies power to front wheels of the vehicle; a hybrid starting generator (HSG) that starts the engine; an engine clutch that is disposed between the engine and a transmission and selectively transmits power from the engine to the front wheels; a motor that supplies power to the rear wheels of the vehicle; a battery that stores electrical energy generated by the HSG and the motor; and a controller that generates friction braking torque on the front wheels when necessary braking torque of the front wheels is larger than regenerative braking torque of the front wheels, and that generates friction braking torque on the rear wheels when necessary braking torque of the rear wheels is larger than regenerative braking torque of the rear wheels, in braking of the vehicle.
