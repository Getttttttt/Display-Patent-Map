abstract
    A method in which open- or closed-loop control of a motor vehicle brake system is carried out having friction brakes on the wheels of at least one axle, wherein the brake pressure generating means for the wheels of at least one axle are in a direct operative connection to the brake pedal, and at least one electrical machine is in an operative connection to at least one axle which can be used by applying an electrically regenerative braking torque for converting kinetic energy into electrical energy. In order to raise the efficiency level of the recuperation, the regenerative deceleration is increased even in the case of an unchanged brake pedal position and/or brake pedal force, and a motor vehicle brake system which is open-loop or closed-loop controlled.
