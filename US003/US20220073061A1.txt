abstract
    When a collision occurs, a driving force of a drive shaft is transmitted to a reversing high-load multiple disk clutch via an inertia absorbing gear mechanism. Then, the driving force is transmitted to a gear via a gear, and inertia is absorbed and the driving force acts to rotate an output shaft at a low speed. On the other hand, when the gear rotates, a regenerative/backing up motor also rotates, and so-called regenerative driving is also performed. Due to these operations, the output shaft rapidly decreases in rotation speed, and goes into a rotation stopping state from a forward rotating state. Then, when a vehicle speed sensor detects that the vehicle speed has reached “0,” the regenerative/backing up motor is driven, the output shaft is driven to rotate reversely for several seconds, and thereafter, driving of the regenerative/backing up motor is stopped.
