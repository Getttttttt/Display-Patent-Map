abstract
    Methods and systems for converting waste heat from cement plant into a usable form of energy are disclosed. The methods and systems make use of two heat source streams from the cement plant, a hot air stream and a flue gas stream, to fully vaporize and superheat a working fluid stream, which is then used to convert a portion of its heat to a usable form of energy. The methods and systems utilize sequential heat exchanges stages to heat the working fluid stream, first with the hot air stream or from a first heat transfer fluid stream heated by the hot air stream and second with the flue gas stream from a second heat transfer fluid stream heated by the hot air stream.
