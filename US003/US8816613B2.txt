abstract
    A reconfigurable battery has at least one bank of statically joined series connected battery cells, each cell including a positive and a negative pole. The poles connect through switches to respective output connections. Activating a set of processor controlled switches reconfigures at least some of the battery cells into a configuration to provide a voltage across the output connections. The output battery voltage may vary intermediately between zero volts and the maximum voltage produced by the series connected battery cells.
