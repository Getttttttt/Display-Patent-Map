abstract
    Disclosed is a hybrid power generation facility. The hybrid power generation facility includes a gas turbine including a compressor configured to compress air introduced from an outside, a combustor configured to mix the compressed air with fuel and to combust the air and fuel mixture, and a turbine configured to produce power with first combustion gas discharged from the combustor, a boiler including a combustion chamber and a burner installed in the combustion chamber and into which the first combustion gas discharged from the turbine of the gas turbine is introduced, a steam turbine through which steam generated in the combustion chamber passes, a first GT (gas turbine) pipeline connected between the turbine of the gas turbine and the burner, a first air pipeline connected to the first GT pipeline to supply oxygen to the burner, a first oxygen sensor installed at an inlet of the burner to measure an oxygen concentration of a fluid flowing into the burner, and a first GT damper installed in the first GT pipeline to control a flow rate of the fluid flowing through the first GT pipeline according to the oxygen concentration measured by the first oxygen sensor.
