abstract
    A method and an arrangement are provided for reducing a NOx-content in the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine in a vehicle. An exhaust gas recirculation supplies exhaust gas from the exhaust outlet to the intake of the internal combustion engine, and at least two energy absorbers are provided in series in the exhaust flow downstream of the exhaust outlet and absorb energy of the exhaust gas. The exhaust gas is overheated to a first temperature by driving the combustion engine in a range of rotational speed producing hot exhaust gas at the exhaust outlet. The first temperature is sufficient to drive the at least two energy absorbers. A temperature of the exhaust gas is established downstream of the at least two energy absorbers sufficient to remove NOx from the exhaust gas in the exhaust after treatment system with an efficiency of more than 80%.
