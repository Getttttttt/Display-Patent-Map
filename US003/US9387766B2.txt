abstract
    A vehicle includes a transmission, energy storage system (ESS), power inverter module (PIM), and controller. The PIM includes a boost converter having a bypass switch and a first plurality of switches, and also a power inverter having a second plurality of switches. The controller is programmed to execute a method that enables a DC boost converter of the PIM by opening the bypass switch when a speed and a torque of the electric machine are within a predetermined boost range. The controller bypasses the boost converter by transmitting a second switching signal closing the bypass switch when the speed and torque are not within the predetermined boost range. A voltage input to the power inverter is equal to the DC battery voltage whenever the boost converter is bypassed and exceeds the DC battery voltage whenever the boost converter is enabled.
