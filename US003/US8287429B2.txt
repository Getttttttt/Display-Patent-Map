abstract
    A shifting control apparatus for a power transmitting system of a vehicle provided with a vehicle drive electric motor, and a step-variable automatic transmission constituting a part of a power transmitting path between said vehicle drive electric motor and drive wheels, the shifting control apparatus controls said vehicle drive electric motor to perform a regenerative operation in a coasting state of the vehicle, and controls said automatic transmission to perform a shift-down operation at a predetermined coasting shift-down vehicle speed in the coasting state, the shifting control apparatus is configured: to change said coasting shift-down vehicle speed according to a regenerative power of said vehicle drive electric motor; to control said vehicle drive electric motor in the coasting state of the vehicle, so as to perform the regenerative operation at a vehicle speed higher than a predetermined drive/driven switching vehicle speed value, and so as to generate a vehicle drive torque at a vehicle speed lower than said predetermined drive/driven switching vehicle speed value; and to lower said coasting shift-down vehicle speed value at which the shift-down operation of said automatic transmission to a lowest shift position thereof is performed, and said drive/driven switching vehicle speed value, with an increase of said regenerative power of said vehicle drive electric motor.
