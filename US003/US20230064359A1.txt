abstract
    An electronic control device is configured to control at least one electromagnetic valve mounted on a vehicle. The electronic control device includes a regenerative current detector configured to detect a regenerative current circulating through the at least one electromagnetic valve immediately after power supply to the at least one electromagnetic valve is stopped. The electronic control device further includes a regenerative current singularity detector configured to detect a regenerative current singularity that is a singularity in a temporal change of the regenerative current. The electronic control device further includes a regenerative current failure detector configured to detect a stuck failure of the at least one electromagnetic valve based on a detection result of the regenerative current singularity detector.
