abstract
    A control device supplies regenerative electric power to increase an output of a low-voltage air conditioner when the regenerative electric power is surplus with respect to electric power that is able to be charged to a main battery as compared with a case where the regenerative electric power is not surplus with respect to the electric power that is able to be charged to the main battery. Therefore, it is possible to reduce an output (work load and electric power per unit time) of a high-voltage air conditioner required to maintain comfort of an occupant in a vehicle cabin. Therefore, it is possible to improve electric power consumption rate while maintaining comfort of the occupant in the vehicle cabin.
