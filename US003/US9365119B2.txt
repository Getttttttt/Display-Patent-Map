abstract
    A method for calculating an amount of regenerative braking for an environmentally-friendly vehicle includes: determining a presence of regenerative braking; determining whether charging is limited due to a high voltage component including a battery and a drive motor of the environmentally-friendly vehicle at the time of the regenerative braking for the environmentally-friendly vehicle; calculating a base speed (base rpm) of a driving motor depending on a charging limit in the charging limit state at the time of the regenerative braking for the environmentally-friendly vehicle and dividing a steady torque area and a steady power area based on the calculated base speed; and determining whether an operating mode of the driving motor is a steady power mode, a steady torque mode, or a conversion mode depending on the divided steady torque area or steady torque area and calculating the amount of regenerative braking based on the determined result.
