abstract
    In an apparatus, a controller performs, as a calculation of d- and q-axis values of a current vector, a first task and a second task. The first task expands one of a measured first phase current and another phase current into Fourier series of the corresponding phase current as a function of an electric rotational angle of an AC motor. The first task extracts a first-order component from the Fourier series to obtain first and second Fourier coefficients of the first-order component. The second task calculates the d-axis value as a first sum of the first and second Fourier coefficients to which temporally-invariant constants of a first pair have been multiplied, and the q-axis value as a second sum of the first and second Fourier coefficients to which temporally-invariant constants of a second pair have been multiplied.
