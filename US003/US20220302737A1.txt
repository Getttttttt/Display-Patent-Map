abstract
    A power supply system includes: a first power circuit having a first battery and a first power line; a second power circuit having a second battery and a second power line; a voltage converter; a power converter; a first voltage acquisition unit which acquires a first closed circuit voltage lower limit CCVmin1 of the first battery; a second voltage acquisition unit which acquires a second closed circuit voltage lower limit CCVmin2 of the second battery; and a power control unit which operates the second power circuit based on a requested power, in which the power control unit isolates the second battery from the second power lines, in a case of a voltage difference between the first closed circuit voltage lower limit CCVmin1 and the second closed circuit voltage lower limit CCVmin2 becoming less than a first voltage threshold value A while output limitation of the second battery is being requested.
