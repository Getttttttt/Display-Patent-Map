abstract
    A solar-powered vehicle with regenerative and mechanical braking includes a chassis or frame, a seat mounted to the frame, a rear axle rotatably supported on the frame, spaced apart left and right rear wheels mounted on the rear axle, and at least one front wheel mounted on the frame. The vehicle includes a selectively engageable regenerative braking system and a selectively engageable mechanical braking system. A lever for engaging the braking systems has three positions, wherein at a first position a reed switch on the lever engages a magnetic source, disabling the regenerative braking system. At a second position, the reed switch disengages the magnetic source, enabling the regenerative braking system. At a third position of the lever, the mechanical braking system is engaged.
