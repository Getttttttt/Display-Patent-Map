abstract
    In a braking device for a motor vehicle having a first group and a second group of brake circuits, each brake circuit being associated with one group of wheels, and at least the first group of brake circuit being implemented as hydraulic brake circuits, at least one group of wheels being connected to at least one operating unit, which may cause a deceleration of the wheels, the task of a comfortable connection of recuperation brake applications to conventional brake applications is achieved in that a control unit controls the brake application of the brake circuit or circuits of the second group and optionally the deceleration effect of the operating unit or assemblies, the first group of brake circuits being activatable directly by the driver using a brake operating unit.
