abstract
    At least some embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for predictive energy management for an electrified powertrain. In some embodiments, the system is configured to: receive a first state-of-charge (SOC) of a high-voltage energy storage system; receive a second SOC of a low-voltage energy storage system; predict an energy recuperation of an electrified powertrain using telematics data; and determine a charging direction of a bidirectional converter based on the predicted energy recuperation, the first SOC, and the second SOC.
