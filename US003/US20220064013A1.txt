abstract
    An integrated steam generator/steam superheater apparatus is disclosed. The disclosed apparatus can be used in a process, such as an ammonia synthesis process, to cool an ammonia converter effluent process gas and to generate superheated steam. The integrated apparatus includes a steam superheater portion wherein hot process gas is used to generate superheated steam by heat transfer to saturated steam. The apparatus also includes a steam generator portion wherein the process gas is used to generate saturated steam by heat transfer to water. Both the superheater and the steam generator are integrated into a single unit, without intervening pluming, etc., thereby saving space and equipment.
