abstract
    A method is provided for scheduling regenerative braking torque, comprising: sensing a position of an accelerator pedal; generating a torque request value in response to the sensed accelerator pedal position; determining a speed of operation of a motor/generator; determining a torque limit in response to the torque request value and the determined speed of the motor/generator; generating a regenerative braking command in response to the torque limit; and outputting the regenerative braking command to the motor/generator.
