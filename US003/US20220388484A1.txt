abstract
    Systems and methods for coordinating and providing braking assistance between towing vehicles and towed vehicles during towing events, such as bidirectional charging towing events, are provided. The towing braking assistance may be provided by the towed vehicle in the form of an assistive braking torque output to assist the towing vehicle with meeting a target deceleration rate during the towing event. The assistive braking torque output may be provided to account for mutual vehicle deceleration events, brake compensation or brake fade events, and stability events of the coupled vehicles during the towing events, for example.
