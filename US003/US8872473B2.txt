abstract
    A system for recharging a battery in a hybrid vehicle provided with two motor is provided. If connection of a recharging connector (recharging stand) is detected, an initial activation of a controller is performed, and a DC link is pre-recharged. If the DC link is pre-recharged to a voltage higher than or equal to a predetermined voltage, an exterior AC or DC electricity is supplied to the battery so as to recharge the battery according to the present invention.
