abstract
    A degradation evaluating unit collects data related to a power storage device from a vehicle through a power cable, and based on the collected data, evaluates the state of degradation of the power storage device. A data processing unit reads data related to the state of degradation of the power storage device evaluated by degradation evaluating unit from a storage unit, and processes the read data related to the state of degradation to a first display item for a user, a second display item for a dealer and a third display item for a manufacturer. A display control unit controls display of the data processed by data processing unit on a display terminal.
