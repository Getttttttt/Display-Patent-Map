abstract
    An example valve includes: a plurality of ports comprising: a first port, a second port, and a third port; a spool configured to block fluid flow from the first port to the third port while allowing fluid flow from the third port to the second port when the valve is in an unactuated state; a spring applying a biasing force on the spool in a proximal direction, wherein when the valve is actuated, the spool moves in a distal direction against the spring, thereby allowing fluid flow from the first port to the third port while blocking fluid flow from the third port to the second port; and a turbine configured to rotate as fluid flows from the first port to the third port when the valve is in an actuated state.
