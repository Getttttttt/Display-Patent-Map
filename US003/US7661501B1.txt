abstract
    An economically operated low cost wheeled vehicle that accommodates a single driver occupant is propelled by power provided by a controllable combination of pedaling action of the driver, an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. The vehicle is elongated upon a center axis between a front extremity and a rear extremity having a single, axially centered wheel that drives the vehicle.
