abstract
    To provide a method and facility for enabling CO2 gas generated in a cement manufacturing facility to be separated and recovered at a high concentration. To this end, according to the present invention, the calcination of a cement material and the recovery of CO2 gas generated in a calciner are performed by one of the following steps of: [1] superheating the cement material before calcination to at least the calcination temperature thereof in a superheating furnace and then mixing the superheated cement material with a new cement material before calcination in a mixer/calciner; [2] mixing, in the mixer/calciner, the cement material before calcination with a part of high-temperature cement clinker discharged from a cement kiln; and [3] using an externally heated calciner.
