abstract
    Embodiments of the invention describe vehicles including a wheel (e.g., a front wheel or wheels), a wheel hub, a motor included in the wheel hub to transmit power to the wheel, one or more rolling bearings to support the wheel hub and having one or more rolling elements to enable rolling of the wheel, and a steering axle placed within the wheel hub for steering the wheel. Embodiments also describe a wheel (e.g., a rear wheel or wheels), a wheel hub, a motor included in the wheel hub to transmit power to the wheel, and a swing arm assembly having a first and a second end, the first end rotatably coupled to a steering axle, the second end coupled to the motor. As described below, embodiments of the invention decrease volume necessary for a vehicle's drivetrain, while not adversely affecting the potential for vehicle interior volume and vehicle maneuverability.
