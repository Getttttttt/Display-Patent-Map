abstract
    A waste heat recovery system comprising a thermal circuit. The thermal circuit includes a boiler and an expander fluidly coupled to the boiler. The thermal circuit further includes a power transfer system integrated to the expander. The power transfer system is configured to receive mechanical energy from the expander. The thermal circuit further includes an ejector fluidly coupled to the boiler and to the power transfer system. The ejector is configured to receive a motive flow of working fluid from the boiler. The ejector is further configured to receive a suction flow of working fluid from the power transfer system. The ejector is further configured to combine the motive flow of working fluid and the suction flow of working fluid.
