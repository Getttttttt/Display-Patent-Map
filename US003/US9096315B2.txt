abstract
    An apparatus for recovering kinetic energy released during and aircraft landing after ground contact, for ground and/or flight operation, comprising at least one energy converter for conversion of the kinetic energy into another energy form, where the energy converter is located in the area of the nose landing gear and/or in the area of the main landing gear of the aircraft. At least one energy storage system is provided for receiving and releasing at least a part of the converted kinetic energy. The apparatus has a high degree of multiple utilization and enables, for example, maneuvering of a landed aircraft on the taxiway independently of the engines, where the aircraft is substantially moved with the braking energy recovered during the landing process. Since the main engines are no longer required for maneuvering, there is a considerable potential for saving energy and the use of motor-operated tow vehicles is eliminated.
