abstract
    A charging system for generating power for an electrical vehicle in motion is provided. The charging system embodies a parallel arrangement of alternators equipped with electromagnetic clutch drives disposed between a starter power source/drive assembly and electric storage device of the electrical vehicle. A charge controller controls the downstream balanced charge to the electric storage device through de-activating or activating the alternators' electromagnetic clutch drives to operate at a set RPM range. The systemic and selective control of the electromagnetic clutches addresses resistance of the alternators at higher RPMs.
