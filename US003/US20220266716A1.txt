abstract
    A device and a method for controlling an SOC of a battery of a hybrid vehicle are provided. The device includes at least one processor, and the processor sets a battery SOC at a time of terminating operation of the vehicle by activating a SOC setting function when a destination is set. The processor further determines whether the set battery SOC is equal to or less than a SOC chargeable with a high efficiency, and performs battery SOC control such that a battery SOC reaches the set battery SOC at a time of arrival at the destination of the vehicle when the set battery SOC is equal to or less than the SOC chargeable with the high efficiency.
