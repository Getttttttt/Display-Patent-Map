abstract
    A space has inlet and outlet registers and outside and exhaust air ducts. The outside air duct is located adjacent to the inlet register. The exhaust air duct is located adjacent to the outlet register. The space has an outside air passageway through the outside air duct adjacent to the inlet register. The space has an exhaust air passageway through the exhaust air duct adjacent to the outlet register. A thermosyphon run around heat pipe assembly includes outside air coils and exhaust air coils. Vapor lines and liquid lines couple the coils. The outside air coils are positioned adjacent to the air inlet duct. The exhaust air coils are located adjacent to the air outlet duct. A control device, in the form of a modulating return damper, is located between the air ducts. An air filter is provided upstream of and adjacent to the outside air coils.
