abstract
    A control system for an electrified powertrain of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) includes an accelerator pedal and a controller configured to determine maximum and minimum values for driver pedal position based on a first position of the accelerator pedal indicative of a first driver pedal position, determine whether the accelerator pedal position remains constant relative to the first position, when the accelerator pedal position does not remain constant and moves to a second position indicative of a second driver pedal position, detect that driver pedal position is increasing when the second driver pedal position is greater than the first minimum value and setting the first maximum value to the second driver pedal position and detect decreasing driver pedal position when the second driver pedal position is less than the first maximum value and setting the minimum value to the second driver pedal position.
