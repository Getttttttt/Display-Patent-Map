abstract
    An apparatus in the form of a transfer unit for transferring exhaust air from the condenser unit of an air conditioning system to an air fan turbine for driving it. The transfer unit includes a plastic, sound absorbing cover shroud for covering the exhaust fan of the condenser unit; a flexible air hose or duct having a first end connected to the cover shroud and a second end for connecting to the intake end of an air fan turbine. The air fan turbine has an intake end, a fan, and an exhaust end, wherein the second end of the air hose is connected to the intake end of the air fan turbine. The transfer unit also includes wiring connected to the output of the air fan turbine for transferring electricity produced by the air fan turbine to an electric storage collector and meter for collecting, storing, measuring, and using the electric energy produced. Also, an inverter may be connected between the air fan turbine and the electric storage collector.
