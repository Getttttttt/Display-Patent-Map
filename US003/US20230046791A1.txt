abstract
    An installation with a steam turbine, a steam generator, and also a condenser, the steam generator being connected in terms of flow to an inlet of the steam turbine, and an outlet of the steam turbine being connected to the condenser, with the condenser being connected to the steam generator. A booster is arranged in a steam line that leads into the steam turbine in which an oxyhydrogen reaction takes place, the resulting steam being fed to a steam turbine.
