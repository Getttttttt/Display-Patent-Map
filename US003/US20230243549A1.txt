abstract
    A heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system for a structure having at least one area to be conditioned includes a blower configured to force an airflow through the HVAC system and a duct assembly in airflow communication with the blower. The duct assembly includes a first duct defining a flow path for a first fluid having a first temperature and a second duct having a hollow interior defining a flow path for a second fluid having a second temperature different from the first temperature. The first duct is arranged within the hollow interior of the second duct such that heat is transferred between the first fluid and the second fluid. At least one of the first duct and the second duct is formed from a collapsible material.
