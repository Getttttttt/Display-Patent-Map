abstract
    For zip line braking, a brake cable travels between at least two terminals. A brake applies a braking force to travel of the brake cable. A link arm is in physical communication with the brake cable. A trolley receiver in physical communication with the link arm and slidably traveling along a zip line receives a trolley slidably traveling along the zip line. The trolley receiver transfers the braking force through the link arm to the trolley.
