abstract
    An electric powertrain comprises a high voltage bus an electric machine, and a traction inverter is coupled between a high voltage bus and the electric machine. An electric voltage for the high voltage bus is generated with the electric machine and the traction inverter when the electric machine is driven mechanically. The generated electric voltage is limited and converted to a predetermined voltage lower than the limited voltage. A unit of the vehicle, such as a cooling pump, is powered with the predetermined voltage.
