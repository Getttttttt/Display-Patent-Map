abstract
    A method is provided for injecting a substance into a boiler of a waste incineration plant using a gaseous propellant, the substance being conducted, starting from at least one distributor, via lines which branch off from the distributor, in each case to a nozzle which is assigned to the respective line and by means of which the substance and the propellant are injected into the boiler. The substance quantity to be conducted to the respective nozzle is set in the distributor. The boiler is subdivided into multiple boiler sectors, in which the nozzles are arranged in a plurality of horizontal nozzle planes. To each boiler sector at least one separate distributor is assigned. The substance and the propellant are combined upstream of the branch-off with the respective line.
