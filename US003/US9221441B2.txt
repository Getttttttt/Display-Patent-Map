abstract
    In a control device for a brake system of a vehicle, given an actuation of a brake actuating element, a buildup of brake pressure is prevented at least in a first wheel brake caliper of a first brake circuit, a first wheel inlet valve of the first wheel brake caliper being controlled to a partly open state, and a first wheel outlet valve of the first wheel brake caliper being kept in a partly open state, a second wheel inlet valve of a second wheel brake caliper of the first brake circuit being controlled to a partly open state, and a second wheel outlet valve of the second wheel brake caliper being controlled to a closed state, in such a way that a brake pressure can be built up in the second wheel brake caliper.
