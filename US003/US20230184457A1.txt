abstract
    A condensate, precipitation and recycled water recovery system is described, for use in cooling applications such as air-cooled air conditioning and refrigeration systems. The recovered and recycled water system is a method designed to assist the air-cooled condenser in cooling the refrigerant, prior to the refrigerant cooling control system evaporator. The system can include an electronic control system, although not essential in all embodiments. In one embodiment, at least one condensate, precipitation, and recycled water recovery system is attached to the condenser of the refrigerant cooling control system. In another embodiment, multiple condensate, precipitation, and recycled water recovery systems are located on the condenser of the refrigerant cooling control system.
