abstract
    A an apparatus of controlling a braking of a vehicle traveling in track mode includes a driving information detector configured to detect a braking request from a driver while the vehicle is driving; and a vehicle controller configured to, when the braking request is detected, control the braking of the vehicle according to a total required torque in response to the detected braking request, wherein the total required torque is a sum of a regenerative braking torque by a motor of the vehicle and a friction braking torque by a brake of the vehicle, wherein the vehicle controller is configured to decrease braking force by friction braking by relatively decreasing friction braking torque by increasing the regenerative braking torque of the total required torque, and wherein the regenerative braking torque is greater than a regenerative braking torque in non-track mode.
