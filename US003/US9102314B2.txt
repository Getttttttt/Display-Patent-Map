abstract
    The invention relates to an onboard network (1) for a vehicle (32), in particular a motor vehicle. The onboard network (1) comprises an electric machine (10) designed for operating in generator mode. The onboard network (1) further comprises a voltage transformer (12) that is at least indirectly connected to the electric machine (10) on the input side and a first energy accumulator (14) connected to the voltage transformer (12) on the output side, in particular an accumulator. The electric machine (10) is designed for the recuperation operation. The voltage transformer (12) is designed to detect or limit a charge state of the first energy accumulator (14) and to regulate the charge state of the first energy accumulator (14) such that the first energy accumulator (14) has a reserve capacity (15) during generator operation, preferably when driving the vehicle in an energy-consuming manner. The voltage transformer (12) is further designed to charge the reserve capacity (15) of the first energy accumulator (14) depending on a recuperation signal (23) received on the input side and representing a recuperation operation of the vehicle (32).
