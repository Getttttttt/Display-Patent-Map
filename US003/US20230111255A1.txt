abstract
    A heat exchanger for heating a fluid flowing through a pipe using a combustion gas includes: a body including open upper and lower ends and having a space formed therein to allow the combustion gas to pass therethrough; a combustor formed in an upper portion of the space in which combustion of the combustion gas occurs; a heat exchange portion formed below the combustor and provided with a heat exchange pipe configured to heat an internal fluid by using the combustion gas; and a heat return pipe provided outside the space so as to be in contact with an outer surface of the body, wherein the combustor and the heat exchange portion may be unitarily formed, and the body in which the combustor is formed includes a concave portion protruding concavely inward so as to correspond to a shape of an outer circumferential surface of the heat return pipe.
