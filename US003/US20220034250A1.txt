abstract
    A vehicle includes an internal combustion engine, a cooling loop, an exhaust system, and a thermosiphon. The cooling loop is configured to direct an engine coolant through the engine. The exhaust system is configured to direct exhaust gas away from the engine. The thermosiphon is configured to transfer heat from the exhaust gas to the engine coolant.
