abstract
    A carbon-dioxide-capture-type steam power generation system 1 according to the present invention comprises a boiler 6 producing an exhaust gas 5 by combusting a fuel 2 and having a flue 8; an absorbing unit 40 being configured to absorb the carbon-dioxide contained in the exhaust gas 5 into an absorbing solution; and a regenerating unit 44 being configured to release the carbon dioxide gas from the absorbing solution absorbing the carbon dioxide and discharge the released carbon dioxide gas. Further, in this system, a reboiler 49 is provided for receiving a heating-medium as heat source, producing a steam 43 and supplying the produced steam 43 to the regenerating unit 44. Additionally, in the flue 8 of the boiler 6, a boiler-side heat exchanger 61 is provided for heating the heating-medium by the exhaust gas 5 passing therethrough.
