abstract
    An installation for recycling contaminated scrap metal includes a furnace frame and a melting furnace arranged within the furnace frame and configured to tilt, and a hood-like housing. The melting furnace includes an upper melting furnace opening and a casting device configured to cast a metal melt produced in the melting furnace into a pan. The hood-like housing is positioned on a top of the melting furnace and surrounds and covers the upper melting furnace opening. The hood-like housing includes at least one door, and a flue gas removal system coupled to the hood-like housing in a gas-tight manner and configured to tilt along with the melting furnace.
