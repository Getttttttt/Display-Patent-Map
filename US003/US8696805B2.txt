abstract
    Disclosed are a heat exchanger for a dehumidifier using a liquid desiccant and a dehumidifier using a liquid desiccant having the same. The heat exchanger for a dehumidifier using a liquid desiccant, comprises: a plurality of plate-type heat exchanger bodies to which a heat transfer medium flows through flow paths formed therein; and a plurality of plates extending between the respective heat exchanger bodies, and inclined with respect to the surfaces of the heat exchanger bodies.
