abstract
    A device (1) for drying and/or preheating metallic and/or non-metallic materials, preferably scrap, comprises a receiving container (3) and a scrap basket (7) which is arranged in the receiving container (3) and has a gas-permeable bottom area (9). The receiving container (3) has at least one process gas inlet line (6) in its wall (4), via which a process gas with a temperature in the range from 200 to 1600° C. can be introduced into the receiving container (3), and at least an injector nozzle (19) arranged coaxially within the at least one process gas inlet line (6) via which a cooling gas can be introduced into the process gas.
