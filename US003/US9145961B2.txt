abstract
    Two motor and planetary gear type speed reducers are disposed sequentially from an outer side in a width direction of a vehicle, whereby the speed reducers are disposed between the motors. A radially outer edge of a ring gear of one of the speed reducers is formed smaller than the smaller one of the two radially outermost edge portions of the motors. An offset space that is recessed further radially than an imaginary line that connects the radially outermost edge portion of one motor with the that of the other motor is provided radially outwards of the ring gear of one of the speed reducers, and at least part of a breather chamber of a breather unit and at least part of a strainer accommodation compartment are disposed within the offset space. It is thus possible to expand a volumetric capacity room that communicates with an interior of a case.
