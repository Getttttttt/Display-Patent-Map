abstract
    The present disclosure in at least one embodiment provides a corner module for a vehicle, including a front-wheel corner module configured to drive a front wheel and including a front-wheel inwheel motor installed on the front wheel to generate a driving force and a friction braking device configured to generate a braking force on the front wheel, a rear-wheel corner module configured to drive a rear wheel and including a rear-wheel inwheel motor installed on the rear wheel to generate a driving force, a driving information detector configured to detect driving information of the vehicle, and an electronic control unit configured to control the front-wheel corner module to form a friction braking force by using the driving information and to control the rear-wheel corner module to form a regenerative braking force, wherein the front-wheel corner module uses the front-wheel inwheel motor that is provided with a lower specification than the rear-wheel inwheel motor to save the manufacturing cost, and the rear-wheel corner module has no friction braking device installed so that the rear-wheel inwheel motor is undamaged by heat.
