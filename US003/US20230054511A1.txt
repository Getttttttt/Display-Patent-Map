abstract
    A heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) unit includes an energy recovery wheel, a first exhaust fan configured to draw a first air flow across the energy recovery wheel and discharge the first air flow from the HVAC unit, a second exhaust fan configured to draw a second air flow across the energy recovery wheel and discharge the second air flow from the HVAC unit, and a controller configured to operate the first exhaust fan and the second exhaust fan in an economizer mode and configured to operate the first exhaust fan and suspend operation of the second exhaust fan in an energy recovery mode.
