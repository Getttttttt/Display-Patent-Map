abstract
    A system and method of maintaining an optimal temperature range for a catalyst section in a HRSG comprising placing a portion of the exhaust stream in a heat exchanger and superheater, diverting a second portion around the heat exchanger and superheater, combining the two portions and contacting the two portions with a catalyst section. Alternatively, a system of heat exchangers are employed to address the fluctuating exhaust temperature caused by the intermittent use of the duct burners.
