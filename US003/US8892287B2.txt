abstract
    With a hybrid vehicle driven at extremely low speeds only by power from the electric motor, when a state-of-charge of the battery becomes equal to or smaller than a predetermined level or when a rotational speed required on the air conditioner compressor is less than a desired rotational speed, power from the internal combustion engine is transmitted to the output shaft by engaging the first engaging and disengaging mechanism, starting the internal combustion engine by power from the electric motor, and thereafter, engaging the first engaging and disengaging mechanism or the second engaging and disengaging mechanism between a fully applied state and a fully released state.
