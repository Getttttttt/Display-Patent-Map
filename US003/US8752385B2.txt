abstract
    A boiler system including an electric power generation system having a boiler, a steam turbine for generating electric power by steams which received heat at a boiler, a condenser provided at the downstream thereof for condensing the steams, and a heater for heating condensed water by steams extracted from the steam turbine and, further, a CO2 capture system of sorbing and capturing a CO2 gas in an exhausted gas exhausted from the boiler by using a solid CO2 sorbent, and a chimney of exhausting an exhaust gas in the CO2 capture system after recovery of CO2 or an exhaust gas exhausted from the boiler, in which the temperature of a fluid concerned with the boiler system is increased by using the exhaust gas exhausted from the CO2 capture system.
