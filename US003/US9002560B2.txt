abstract
    In a hybrid vehicle that is in a four-wheel drive system based on FF layout and that is switchable between a two-wheel drive state and a four-wheel drive state by an electronically controlled coupling 10, the electronically controlled coupling 10 is controlled to a release side when an engine 1 is started in an EV-4WD travel state so as to reduce the transmission amount of engine torque to a drive system of a side of rear wheels 8L and 8R.
