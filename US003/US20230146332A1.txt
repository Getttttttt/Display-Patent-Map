abstract
    A turbocharged compressor system using an Organic Rankine Cycle system to recover waste heat from a compression process. The Organic Rankine Cycle system circulates an organic fluid through an evaporator, where the organic fluid vaporizes and is expanded in a turbine section of a turbocharger to drive a compressor section of the turbocharger. The organic fluid vapor is condensed in a condenser and is pumped to the evaporator once again for recirculation. The compressor section of the turbocharger pre-compresses a working fluid before entering an airend in a compression system. As the working fluid exits the airend, it may be delivered to the evaporator, where the waste heat from the working fluid evaporates the organic fluid flowing in the Organic Rankine Cycle system. The working fluid may also be circulated between intercoolers in multi-stage compressor systems.
