abstract
    A method for manufacturing a cement clinker includes a rotary furnace, a cyclone preheater receiving the fumes from said rotary furnace, an air blowing clinker cooler, and at least one heat exchanger, referred to as a first heat exchanger. The raw materials are preheated and decarbonated in said cyclone preheater. The clinker is cooled in said clinker cooler. A first portion of the hot air generated by said clinker cooler, or so-called secondary air, is directed to the rotary furnace to be used as combustion air. A second portion of the hot air generated, or so-called tertiary air, is directed and carried separately from the first portion to a place in the facility where fuel is burned. A third portion of hot air generated in said clinker cooler, or so-called excess air, is carried into at least said first heat exchanger for the purpose of recovering power to produce electricity.
