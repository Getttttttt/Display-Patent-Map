abstract
    A motor vehicle has a motor, an inverter, a first power storage device, with a large-capacity characteristic, a second power storage device, with a high-power characteristic, a power converter and a circuit. The power converter has a voltage step down function during power driving. In the circuit, the power converter is connected to the first power storage device and the second power storage device. Thus, the first power storage device and the second power storage device are parallel to each other. During the power driving of the motor, the power converter steps down an output voltage of the first power storage device to supply energy from the first power storage device and the second power storage device to the inverter.
