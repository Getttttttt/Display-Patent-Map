abstract
    A combined cycle power plant system and methods of operation so as to minimize consumption of cooling water utilizes exhaust from a combustion turbine to generate steam for power generation in a steam turbine topping cycle. The exhaust steam from the steam turbine topping cycle is utilized to vaporize an organic working fluid in an organic working fluid bottoming cycle, where vaporized organic working fluid expanded across a turbine generates additional power. Exhaust gas from the organic working fluid bottoming cycle is condensed utilizing an air-cooled heat exchanger. Heat exchange bundles of the air-cooled heat exchanger are preferably arranged horizontally relative to the ground to maximize efficiency. Turbine inlet cooling is employed at the combustion turbine to recapture energy lost in the system. A thermal energy storage tank may be utilized in conjunction with the turbine inlet cooling to supply chilling water to the system.
