abstract
    A conventional vehicular charging port (or inlet) is geometrically different from a power supply plug of general electrical equipment, and the power supply plug cannot directly be connected to the inlet. The present invention provides an adapter (800) including a first connection portion (801) that corresponds in geometry to an inlet (270) and a second connection portion (805) that corresponds in geometry to a power supply plug of electrical equipment (700) external to a vehicle. Furthermore, the adapter (800) includes a second control device (850) capable of outputting a signal to a first control device (170) of the vehicle. When the first connection portion (801) is connected to the inlet (270), the second control device (850) outputs a power supply instruction signal, which is indicative of an instruction to supply electric power, to the first control device (170) to cause the first control device (170) to control a power conversion device (160) of the vehicle to supply electric power from the power conversion device (160) to the electrical equipment (700). Thus the power supply plug of the electrical equipment (700) can be connected to the vehicle to supply electric power from the vehicle to the electrical equipment (700).
