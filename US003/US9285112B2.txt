abstract
    A power plant includes a boiler, a steam turbine, a generator driven by that steam turbine, a condenser, a post combustion processing system and an energy storage system including at least one electrochemical cell to store excess electrical energy generated by the generator during period valley demand and release thermal energy for power plant operations at other times.
