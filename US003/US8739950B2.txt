abstract
    An auxiliary pump system for a hybrid powertrain includes a hydraulic accumulator, a hydraulic transformer, a plurality of control devices, a sump, and a plurality of fluid flow paths. The accumulator is charged by a high flow, high pressure hydraulic fluid by opening a first of the control devices and closing a second of the control devices. The accumulator is discharged by closing the first of the control devices and opening the second of the control devices. A high pressure, low flow hydraulic fluid is communicated from the accumulator to the hydraulic transformer. The hydraulic transformer converts the high pressure, low flow hydraulic fluid into a high flow, low pressure hydraulic fluid that is employed by systems within the hybrid powertrain.
