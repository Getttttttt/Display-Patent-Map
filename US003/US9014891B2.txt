abstract
    A control unit increases a discharge allowable power when the running mode is at a charge depleting mode and an engine is stopped. An engine operation determination unit determines whether the engine is to be set at load operation or not based on a non-increased power value when the running mode is at the charge sustaining mode, and based on an increased power value when the running mode is at the charge depleting mode. In the case where the engine is at no-load operation, the engine operation determination unit determines whether the engine is to be set at load operation or not based on the non-increased power value even if the running mode is at the charge depleting mode.
