abstract
    An energy harvesting system comprises a first region having a first temperature and a second region having a second temperature. A heat engine is configured for converting thermal energy to mechanical energy. The heat engine includes a plurality of discrete elements of a shape memory alloy each having a crystallographic phase changeable between austenite and martensite in response to a temperature difference between the first region and the second region. At least one member of the heat engine is driven to rotate about a first axis by the phase change of the plurality of discrete elements.
