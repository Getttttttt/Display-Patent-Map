abstract
    A waste elimination apparatus includes a natural gas ignition system, a silica material bed, a heat transfer device, and a system for collecting plasma produced energy. A reaction formed by heat from ignition, carbon from the waste material, supercritical water, —OH radicals, and muons released from the silica bed transform the waste into a fuel. This fuel is more efficiently consumed by the complete combustion process resulting in near total elimination of the waste, increased energy production, and virtually no emissions.
