abstract
    Methods, systems, and apparatus for a continuously adaptable braking pedal system. The braking system includes an electric motor that is configured to generate regenerative energy and provide a regenerative braking torque. The braking system includes an electronic control unit coupled to the electric motor. The electronic control unit is configured to determine an amount of the regenerative braking torque to be applied based on an adaptable pedal map and an amount of braking force. The electronic control unit is configured to control an amount of the regenerative braking torque to be applied.
