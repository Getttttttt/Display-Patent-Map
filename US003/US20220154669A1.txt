abstract
    An air conditioning system includes a compressor and a refrigerant line. A power generating unit may be disposed along the refrigerant line to generate power from the heat in the refrigerant line while helping to convert hot compressed refrigerant gas into a hot high-pressure refrigerant liquid. An air conditioning system may also involve using a cooling chamber to use refrigerant to cool a heat exchange medium which is then used in a cooling coil to condition air.
