abstract
    A charge device converting electric power from an external power supply into a charging electric power for a power storage device is configured to allow power conversion bidirectionally. An AC/DC converter of an external charging system converts AC power of a power line into a charging electric power for an auxiliary battery. A DC/DC converter of the vehicle running system converts the electric power from the power storage device into the charging power for the auxiliary battery. When charging of the auxiliary battery is requested, a control device selectively executes a first charge of converting the electric power of the power storage device by the DC/DC converter to charge the auxiliary battery, and a second charge of converting the electric power of the power storage device by a charge device and the AC/DC converter to charge the auxiliary battery, according to an output state of the auxiliary battery.
