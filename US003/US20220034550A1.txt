abstract
    A heated flue includes a flue section configured to be fluidly coupled to an exhaust outlet of a boiler. At least one heater is mechanically coupled to the flue section to heat an exhaust gas flowing within. A sensor is mechanically coupled to the flue section or disposed within the flue section. The sensor is configured to measure a parameter of the exhaust gas flowing within. A controller is operatively coupled to the at least one heater and the sensor. The controller is configured to control a temperature of the exhaust gas based on the parameter. A method to vent a condensing boiler into a non-condensing rated stack is also described.
