abstract
    A power system is provided that includes a first voltage bus, a traction motor configured to generate electrical power during a regenerative braking mode and to supply the generated electrical power to the first voltage bus, and an auxiliary system coupled to the first voltage bus. The auxiliary system comprises a second voltage bus and a power interface unit coupling the first voltage bus to the second voltage bus. The auxiliary system also comprises an energy storage device coupled to the second voltage bus and configured to store energy supplied to the second voltage bus and configured to supply stored energy to the second voltage bus and an auxiliary load configured to receive power based on power in the second voltage bus.
