abstract
    Systems and methods for controlling temperature and humidity within a space in a building. Outdoor air and return air from the space are passed through particular equipment in a particular order. Equipment includes a secondary direct-expansion refrigeration circuit, a recovery wheel, a primary cooling coil, secondary circuit evaporator and condenser coils, and a dehumidification wheel. Various embodiments include multiple zones, chilled beams, and a dedicated outdoor air supply (DOAS) subsystem delivering dehumidified air to active chilled beams. In various embodiments, supply air passes first through the recovery wheel, then through the primary cooling coil, then through the dehumidification wheel, and then to the space. Further, in some embodiments, exhaust air passes through the dehumidification wheel and then through the recovery wheel. Pump modules may supply chilled beams and control their temperature to avoid condensation. A chiller may supply cooling water to both the primary cooling coil and the pump modules.
