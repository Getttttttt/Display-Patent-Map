abstract
    Various embodiments of the invention include a system including: at least one computing device operably connected with a steam turbomachine and an extraction conduit fluidly connected with the steam turbomachine and a steam seal header fluidly coupled with the steam turbomachine, the at least one computing device configured to modify an output of the steam turbomachine by performing actions including: determining a pressure within the steam turbomachine; comparing the pressure within the steam turbomachine with a pressure threshold range; and instructing the extraction conduit to extract steam seal header steam from the steam seal header and provide the extracted steam seal header steam to the steam turbomachine in response to determining the pressure within the steam turbomachine deviates from the pressure threshold range.
