abstract
    The train-information management device includes a position detection unit; a regenerating-condition detection unit that detects a regenerative-brake usage condition; a train-line-information holding unit that holds therein information on a section in which a train is more likely to use a brake; a residual-air-amount calculation unit that calculates the amount of residual air in an air tank; and a compressor control unit that controls a compressor. In a regeneration-preparation condition, if a train is running through a position where the distance between the position and a section in which a train is more likely to use a brake is equal to or less than a given value, if the train does not use a regenerative brake, and if the amount of residual air reaches 0%, the compressor control unit causes a compressor to start generating compressed air.
