abstract
    A mild hybrid system according embodiments of the invention may include: a motor-alternator; an inverter for controlling electrical energy flow to and from the motor-alternator; an electrical energy storage for storing electrical energy generated by the motor-alternator; and a unidirectional DC/DC buck converter including a bypass means for providing a physical connection between the motor-alternator and a vehicle electrical load. With the system, the manufacturing cost can be reduced, packaging process can be simplified, and an additional cooling device is not required.
