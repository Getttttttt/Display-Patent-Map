abstract
    A hybrid vehicle control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle capable of EV travel generated by a motor-generator with an internal combustion engine is provided. The control apparatus includes a maximum value calculation unit for calculating a maximum value of a supply of electric power for an electrically-heated catalyst, when the internal combustion engine is in a stopped state, provided to the electrically-heated catalyst based on (i) at least one of a start-up electric power required for starting up the engine or an operation electric power required for operating a supplemental device, (ii) an electric power output limit value of the battery, and (iii) an electric power required for a travel of the hybrid vehicle. The control apparatus also includes a power supply controller for controlling the supply of electric power for the electrically-heated catalyst based on the maximum value of the supply of electric power for the electrically-heated catalyst.
