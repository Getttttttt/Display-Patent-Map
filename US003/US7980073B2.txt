abstract
    A hybrid system for a machine is disclosed. The system has a pump configured to generate fluid flow within a hydraulic system and a first actuator actuated by fluid pressurized by the pump. The system also has a first motor configured to be selectively actuated by pressurized fluid directed from the first actuator by an external load and directed to the first motor by a first control valve. The system further has a first generator configured to be actuated by the first motor and a power source configured to actuate the pump. The system also has a powertrain including a first driveshaft and at least one traction device, the powertrain configured to transfer kinetic energy from the traction device to the first driveshaft during deceleration of the machine. The system further has a second generator configured to be selectively actuated by the kinetic energy transferred by the powertrain.
