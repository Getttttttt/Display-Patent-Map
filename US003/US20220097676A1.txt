abstract
    The invention provides a brake assist and retarder system for hybrid commercial vehicles. The system is mainly specific to the application scenarios of long-distance transport for large commercial vehicles (trucks or buses). According to the vehicle-mounted three-dimensional electronic map, the three-dimensional positioning data of the vehicle measured by the navigator, and data such as relative speed and absolute distance between the vehicle and the vehicle ahead in the same lane measured by the forward looking millimeter wave radar, the electrical power split device is commanded through the vehicle control unit to allocate the flow direction and amplitude of 100 kW-class electric power accurately, continuously and dynamically among the generator set, the power battery pack and the driving motor with response time scale of 10 ms, and meet the transient power balance of road load required by the vehicle dynamics equation in real time; achieve vehicle energy saving and emission reduction through predictive adaptive cruise control and fuel saving AI algorithms, educe drivers' labor intensity of long-distance driving, realize the functions of emergency brake assist and retarding when the vehicle is going down a long slope, and improve the vehicle driving safety.
