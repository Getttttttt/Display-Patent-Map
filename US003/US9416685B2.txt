abstract
    A combined cycle plant (10) including: a gas turbine engine (12) having a compressor (14), a combustor and a gas turbine (16); a heat recovery steam generator (20) (HRSG) configured to receive exhaust from the gas turbine engine; a steam turbine (22, 24) configured to receive steam from the HRSG; a supplemental air arrangement (40) configured to generate supplemental heated air (42) when operating and to operate independent of the gas turbine engine; and a kettle boiler (26, 28) configured to use heat from the supplemental heated air to generate steam used in the steam turbine.
