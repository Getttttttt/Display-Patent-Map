abstract
    Pickup trucks with an internal combustion engine (ICE), all electric, hybrid, plug in hybrid, must walk on loading flat bed, to load or unload, two stationary side walls, one-fold down tail gate, two taillights one on each side at the rear next to the fold down tail gate. With two full doors, with two full doors and with two smaller rear doors, or four full doors. It takes less compressed clean air to drive the DC alternators or DC generators from the compressed clean air engine. Also, the vehicle does drive 100% electric. A combination 100% electric and 100% compressed clean air system. No other vehicle has this kind of system.
