abstract
    A system for recovering heat from recirculating exhaust gases is provided. The system includes a first exhaust manifold in fluid communication with multiple combustion chambers of an engine. The system also includes a turbocharger having a turbine stage and a compressor stage, wherein the turbine stage comprises an inlet port in fluid communication with the first exhaust manifold and the compressor stage includes an inlet port for air intake and an outlet port for compressed air. The system includes an exhaust gas recirculation cooler having a first flow path and a second flow path, wherein the first flow path is configured to receive a portion of exhaust gas from the first exhaust manifold flowing through an exhaust gas recirculation loop. The second flow path includes an inlet for receiving a compressed air for drawing heat from the exhaust gas flowing through the first flow path.
