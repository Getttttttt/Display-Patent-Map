abstract
    A master cylinder device includes a housing whose front side end is closed and which includes a third housing member separating an interior of the housing into a front side chamber and a rear side chamber and having an opening through the third housing member, a first pressurizing piston which includes a main body portion disposed in the front side chamber and which is moved forward by receiving a force for pressurizing the brake fluid to be supplied to a brake devices, and an input piston. In the master cylinder device, an input chamber into which a brake fluid is introduced is defined between a rear end of the main body portion of the first pressurizing piston and the third housing member. The input piston is fitted in the housing with seals, whereby, an inter-piston chamber across which the input piston and the pressure receiving piston face to each other.
