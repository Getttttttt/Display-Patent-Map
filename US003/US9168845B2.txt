abstract
    Disclosed is a method of controlling an operation mode of a fuel cell in a fuel cell vehicle wherein, (a) when a driver-demanded torque is lower than a first torque, and a current state of charge (SOC) in a battery is higher than a first SOC, the operation mode of the fuel cell is converted to a stop mode, and (b) when the driver-demanded torque is higher than a second torque, or the current SOC in the battery is lower than a second SOC, the operation mode is converted to a start mode, wherein the second torque is higher than the first torque and the second SOC is lower than the first SOC.
