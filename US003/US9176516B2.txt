abstract
    A dual stage accelerator pedal spring assembly is provided that allows the transition point between stroke stages to be adjusted in order to control pedal travel within the first stroke stage and provide the driver with a customizable accelerator pedal interface. The spring assembly, which uses two springs exhibiting different spring force, allows adjustment of the relative positions of the two springs in order to control the transition point between the first and second pedal stroke stages.
