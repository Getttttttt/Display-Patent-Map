abstract
    A method for dynamically controlling rollback in an electric vehicle having a motor for providing motive power to the electric vehicle and a shift lever for selecting either forward or reverse motion of the vehicle includes determining if the electric vehicle is moving in a direction opposite the direction of motion indicated by the shift lever. If the vehicle is moving in a direction opposite the direction indicated by the shift lever, the rollback acceleration of the vehicle is calculated. A power request for driving the electric motor is then determined such that the rollback of the vehicle is controlled. The determined power request is then applied to the electric motor thereby driving the electric motor and dynamically controlling the rollback.
