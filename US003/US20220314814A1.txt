abstract
    A vehicle brake system including a regenerative cooperative control device configured to control a regenerative brake device that applies a regenerative braking force to one of front and rear wheels and/or a friction brake device that applies a friction braking force to the front and rear wheels. After the regenerative braking force reaches an allowable regenerative braking force, the friction braking force applied to the other of the front and rear wheels is increased by the friction brake device up to a first friction braking force less than a braking force on an actual braking-force distribution line determined by the regenerative braking force at a time when it reaches the allowable regenerative braking force, and the friction braking forces applied to the one and the other of the front and rear wheels are subsequently increased so as to bring the friction braking forces close to the actual braking-force distribution line.
