abstract
    The invention relates to a method for operating a vehicle (1), in which energy is recovered in overrun and/or braking phases (T2) of the vehicle (1) and stored in an energy store (4, 5) within the vehicle, wherein the environment (E) of the vehicle (1) is detected by means of a detector (6, 13) and, depending on detection of an object (2, 11) in the vehicle environment (E), at least one object characteristic (v2, Δv, L) is evaluated and, depending on the evaluation of the object characteristic (v2, Δv, L), the overrun and/or braking phase (T2) is performed automatically in a manner adapted to at least one parameter characterizing the energy store (4, 5). The invention also relates to a driver assistance device (7) for a vehicle (1).
