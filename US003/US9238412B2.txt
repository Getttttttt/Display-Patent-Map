abstract
    A method of operating a vehicle having a friction braking system and a regenerative braking system is presented here. The method determines a regenerative torque capacity, calculates a desired regenerative torque amount for the braking system, detects that the desired regenerative torque amount exceeds the regenerative torque capacity by at least a threshold amount, and controls actuation of the friction braking system in response to the detecting. Another operating method determines a coastdown torque capability of the vehicle, calculates a desired coastdown torque amount, detects that the desired coastdown torque amount exceeds the coastdown torque capability by at least a threshold amount, and controls actuation of the friction braking system in response to the detecting.
