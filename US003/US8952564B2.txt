abstract
    A PLG-ECU for external charging is provided separately from an HV-ECU for vehicle running, and configured to be capable of controlling external charging relays to be turned on/off. A sub DC/DC converter converting the output voltage of a charger into an auxiliary system voltage at the time of external charging is provided separately from a main DC/DC converter of large capacity used at the time of vehicle running. At the time of external charging, PLG-ECU can execute external charging without starting a vehicle running system while sub DC/DC converter can generate an auxiliary system voltage. Since external charging can be executed while system main relays each are kept turned off, a high voltage is not applied to components at the succeeding stage. Consequently, a main battery can be externally charged without exerting any influence on the durability and the life of each component of the vehicle running system.
