abstract
    An energy recovery ventilator (ERV) monitoring and reporting system and a method of monitoring and reporting information on an ERV. In one embodiment, the system includes: (1) a processor configured to carry out a plurality of monitoring and reporting functions on the ERV based on a model, and types and locations of sensors, of the ERV, (2) a memory coupled to the processor and configured to store data gathered from the sensors and (3) a commissioning database associated with the memory and configured to contain commissioning data regarding the model of the ERV.
