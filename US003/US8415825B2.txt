abstract
    In a power conversion device of a vehicle, when a collision of a vehicle is detected, the voltage of a gate signal that drive a semiconductor switching element included in the power conversion device is decreased, and residual charge stored in a smoothing capacitor is discharged. Such a configuration increases switching loss when the semiconductor switching element is turned on or off during discharge of the residual charge in the power conversion device, so that discharge of the residual charge can be accomplished in a shorter time.
