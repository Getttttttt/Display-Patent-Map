abstract
    A method and an apparatus recover heat and convert the heat into mechanical power in a drive system for motor vehicles. A working medium carried in a working medium circuit is evaporated by an evaporator integrated into the working medium circuit by waste heat from an internal combustion engine. The vapor generated is fed to an expansion machine coupled to the internal combustion engine, and the exhaust vapor from the expansion machine is then converted back into the liquid phase in at least one condenser. Accordingly at least one valve, which can be subjected to control by a control device, and a vapor accumulator are integrated into the working medium circuit downstream of the evaporator such that the vapor generated is fed into the vapor accumulator. The vapor stored in the vapor accumulator is fed back at least in part into the working medium circuit to drive the expansion machine.
