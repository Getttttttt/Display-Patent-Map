abstract
    A fresh air conditioning system includes a first cooling device having a first cooling end and a first heating end; a dehumidifying rotary defining a first section and a second section. An airflow switching device directs a fresh airflow toward the first cooling end or the first heating end, and then flows to the first section. A return airflow passes through a first heat exchanger, and conducts heat exchange with the other end of the first cooling device, and then flows to the second section. Or switching opposite ends of the first cooling device to selectively cool or heat, the fresh airflow conducts heat exchange with one end of the first cooling device, and then flows to the first section. The return airflow conducts heat exchange with the other end of the cooling device and then flows to the second section.
