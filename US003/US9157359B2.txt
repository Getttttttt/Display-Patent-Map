abstract
    Technologies are generally described for recovery of energy from engines. The described technology may be applied to systems, methods, and/or apparatuses. An example exhaust energy recovery apparatus (50) may include at least one thermal to electrical energy conversion element (60) having at least one side for thermal coupling along a substantial length (34, 35, 36) of an exhaust duct (30) for a combustion engine. The example apparatus (50) may also include a cover (52) located over at least a portion of the exhaust duct (30) adjacent to the at least one energy conversion element (60). A channel (53) may be formed between the cover (52) and an exterior portion of the exhaust duct (30), the channel having at least one inlet (54, 56) for admission of cooling fluid.
