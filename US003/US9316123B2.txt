abstract
    The present invention generally relates to power generation systems configured to absorb and capture a component, such as carbon dioxide, in a flue gas for later sequestration or utilization, wherein heat generated in the sorption process is captured for use in the power generation system. In some examples, the heat of sorption is used to preheat fluids in one or more systems of the power generation system to reduce the heating load on the subsystem. By using the heat of sorption, the carbon dioxide capture and sequestration process not only reduces or eliminates the concentration of carbon dioxide in the flue gas, but reduces or eliminates the parasitic effect of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration on power generation.
