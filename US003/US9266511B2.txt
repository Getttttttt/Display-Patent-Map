abstract
    A method and system for controlling regenerative braking of a hybrid electric vehicle. The regenerative braking system includes a driver-operable brake pedal, a hydraulically actuated friction brake for at least one front wheel, an anti-lock braking system hydraulically connected to the hydraulically actuated friction brake, and an electrically actuated friction brake for at least one rear wheel. The regenerative braking system further includes an electric machine connected to the at least one rear wheel and capable of performing regenerative braking of the at least one rear wheel, and an electronic control unit that controls the stability of the hybrid electric vehicle. The regenerative braking system is configured to provide increased braking torque of the front hydraulically actuated friction brake by means of the anti-lock braking system for compensating a decreased or limited rear wheel braking torque initiated by the electronic control unit.
