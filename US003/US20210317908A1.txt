abstract
    A hydraulic accelerator for providing an improved hydraulic accelerator within a hydraulic drive system is disclosed. The hydraulic accelerator is constructed from a set of four (4) top blades, a set of four (4) bottom blades, a bottom rod, a hen gear, a planetary gear small, a top rod, a planetary gear assembly, a middle bearing seat tube, and a funnel. Each of the top blades are combined with a corresponding bottom blade and the pair of blades are located at 90Â° angles from each other around a central axis. The central axis consists of the top rod and the bottom rod that are attached to each end of the middle bearing seat tube.
