abstract
    A cooling system is configured to cool exhaust gases exiting a furnace of a steel production system through an exhaust hood, a dropout box, and a hot gas duct of the steel production system. The cooling system includes an inlet configured to receive water from a water pump for cooling the exhaust gases, and an outlet configured to exhaust the water from the cooling system. The cooling system further includes a first water line configured to supply the water to the exhaust hood of the steel production system for cooling the exhaust gas received therein, and a second water line configured to supply the water to the dropout box of the steel production system for cooling the exhaust gas received therein. The cooling system also includes a third water line configured to supply the water to the hot gas duct of the steel production system for cooling the exhaust gas received therein, and each of the first water line, the second water line, and the third water line are operably coupled between the inlet and the outlet of the cooling system. The cooling system also includes a controller configured to control and maintain a defined temperature of the water circulating within the cooling system.
