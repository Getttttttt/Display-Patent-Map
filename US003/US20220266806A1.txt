abstract
    A technique controls an electric brake of a vehicle. The technique involves continuously providing power to the electric brake of the vehicle to continuously disengage the electric brake and allow the vehicle to move. The technique further involves, while power is continuously provided to the electric brake and the vehicle is moving, sensing a fault condition. The technique further involves, in response to sensing the fault condition, providing electric pulses to the electric brake in place of continuously providing power to the electric brake, the electric pulses having varying pulse timing that controls braking of the vehicle. Accordingly, the vehicle is able to provide a more consistent braking response regardless of variations in certain factors such as brake calibration and/or current wear, the current weight in the vehicle, the current temperature, etc.
