abstract
    A system may include a turbine and a recuperative heat exchanger system. The recuperative heat exchanger system is configured to receive exhaust gases from the turbine. The recuperative heat exchanger system may include a precool section to cool the exhaust gases, a major heating section to receive the cooled the exhaust gases, and a minor heating section to receive the cooled the exhaust gases.
