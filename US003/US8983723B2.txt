abstract
    Braking/driving force control that includes: detecting a driver's operating state for causing the vehicle to run; detecting a vehicle body motional state while the vehicle is running; computing a target longitudinal driving force for causing the vehicle to run and motional state amounts for controlling a vehicle body behavior on the basis of the detected operating state and motional state; and computing driving or braking forces allocated to the wheels so as to achieve the computed target longitudinal driving force and target motional state amounts and that the braking/driving force generating mechanism causes the wheels to generate independently.
