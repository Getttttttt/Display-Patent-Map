abstract
    A hybrid vehicle driving device including an engine drive system transmitting a drive force of an engine to a transmission through a one-way clutch and transmitting a drive force after shifting by the transmission to a rear wheel and a motor drive system transmitting a drive force of a motor to the rear wheel, the drive force of the motor of the motor drive system is joined to a point upstream the transmission and downstream the one-way clutch in the engine drive system. The transmission includes a twin clutch capable of shifting between neighboring shift gears by alternately switching the connection state of a clutch on one side and a clutch on the other side, and is automatically shifted to produce an optional rotational speed and motor torque at which the electric power generation efficiency becomes high at the time of regeneration control of the motor.
