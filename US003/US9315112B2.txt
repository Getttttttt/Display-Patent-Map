abstract
    During external charging, a charger converts AC electric power from an external power supply into electric power for charging a main battery. An AC/DC converter converts the AC electric power on the power line into auxiliary electric power. The charger is further capable of executing power conversion for converting output electric power of the main battery into AC electric power for output to the power line. While a vehicle is running, normally, the charger and the AC/DC converter are stopped, and the auxiliary electric power obtained by converting the output electric power of the main battery by a main DC/DC converter is output. At the time of regenerative braking of the vehicle, where charging of the main battery is prohibited or restricted, the charger and the AC/DC converter are further operated to intentionally increase loss power, thereby generating auxiliary electric power.
