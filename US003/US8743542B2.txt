abstract
    An apparatus for cooling of a substantially closed space, in particular a data center, where continuous or intermittent heat is produced by at least one heat source, with recirculation air, includes a heat exchanger with a first set of ducts and a second set of ducts, each set of ducts having an in- and outlet. The in- and outlet of the first set of ducts are connected to the space to form a first recirculation path, and the in- and outlet of the second set of ducts are connected to an environment of the space to form a second recirculation path. The heat exchanger is a plate heat exchanger.
