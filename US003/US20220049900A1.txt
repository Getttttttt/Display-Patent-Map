abstract
    An apparatus is disclosed for a metallurgical furnace having a roof with an integrated off-gas hood. The roof has a hollow metal roof. The hollow metal roof has a top, a bottom, an outer sidewall and an inner sidewall. An opening extends from the top to the bottom and is defined by the inner sidewall. The opening is configured for one or more electrodes to pass therethrough. An enclosed space is defined between the top, the bottom, the inner sidewall and the outer sidewall. A spray-cooled system is disposed in the enclosed space and configured to spray coolant in the enclosed space on the bottom surface of the hollow metal roof. A channel having walls is disposed through the enclosed space, wherein the spray-cooled system extends between the top of the hollow metal roof and the wall of the channel.
