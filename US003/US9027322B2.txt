abstract
    An integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant includes an air separation unit configured to discharge a nitrogen flow and an oxygen flow. A first heat exchanger is attached to the air separation unit and heats the discharged nitrogen flow. A second heat exchanger is attached to the air separation unit and heats the discharged oxygen flow. A third heat exchanger is attached to a steam cycle of the IGCC and heats a condensate stream received from the steam cycle. A first adiabatic air compressor is attached to the first, second, and third heat exchangers. The adiabatic air compressor is configured to discharge a compressed air flow comprising a first flow and a second flow. The first flow is channeled to the first and third heat exchangers, and the second flow is channeled to the second and third heat exchangers.
