abstract
    A control apparatus for a motor-assisted bicycle detects a pedaling torque applied to a crankshaft with a pedaling force sensor, controls a motor unit in a regenerative control process to charge a battery if the torque value of the detected pedaling torque is equal to or smaller than a predetermined level, and controls the motor unit in an assistive control process if the torque value is greater than the predetermined level. The control apparatus controls the motor unit in the regenerative control process at a crankshaft angular position in which the torque value detected by the pedaling force sensor is equal to or smaller than the predetermined level, and switches from the regenerative control process to the assistive control process for controlling the motor unit at a crankshaft angular position in which the torque value detected by the pedaling force sensor becomes higher than the predetermined level.
