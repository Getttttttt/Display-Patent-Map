abstract
    A controller unit facilitates determining that a fast approaching forward vehicle has breached a fast approach threshold and may initiate brake regeneration to slow a commercial hybrid host vehicle in which the controller is employed. The controller determines whether there is capacity in the state of charge (SOC) of a high voltage battery to permit brake regeneration, and/or determines whether there is capacity in on board air tanks to permit a compressor motor to compress air, thereby drawing charge from the battery to create brake regeneration capacity. When battery SOC is below a predetermined threshold and a fast approaching vehicle breaches a fast approach threshold, the controller sends a brake regeneration command to a traction motor to act as a generator to supply charge to the battery, which in turn slows the vehicle.
