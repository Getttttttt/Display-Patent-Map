abstract
    Plastic-powered power generator. In an embodiment, the plastic-powered power generator comprises a primary reactor with an air-fuel distribution assembly configured to supply fluidized polymer, air, and oxidizer to a primary reactor chamber, and an ignition system configured to ignite a mixture of the fluidized polymer, air, and oxidizer. The primary reactor chamber extends into a secondary reactor, to, when ignited, heat air flowing through the secondary reactor from a blower to a heat exchanger. The heated air flow may convert fluid, in a coil within the heat exchanger, into steam, which can drive a turbine to generate electrical power.
