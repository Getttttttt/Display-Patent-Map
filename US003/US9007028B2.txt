abstract
    A control device controls charging/discharging of an electric power storage device for supplying electric power to a load device. The control device includes: a limit value setting unit setting a limit value of charging electric power for the electric power storage device based on the state of the electric power storage device; a target setting unit setting a target value of the charging electric power based on the state of the load device and the limit value; a correction unit correcting the limit value based on a difference between the target value and the actual electric power input to and output from the electric power storage device; and a command setting unit setting a command value of the charging electric power based on the state of the load device and the corrected limit value.
