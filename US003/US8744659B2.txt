abstract
    A regeneration control device of a hybrid vehicle comprises a comparison unit for, when a regenerative torque generated in the electric motor is used as a braking force during deceleration of the vehicle using only the electric motor, comparing a preset target deceleration with an actual deceleration; and a control unit for, in a case where the result of comparison of the comparison unit indicates that a state in which the actual deceleration is equal to or lower than the target deceleration occurs in a predetermined pattern though the electric motor is generating the maximum regenerative torque, causing the vehicle to travel using both an engine and the electric motor in a cooperative manner during the next deceleration after the current deceleration has been finished, such that the engine braking and the regeneration torque are both used as a braking force.
