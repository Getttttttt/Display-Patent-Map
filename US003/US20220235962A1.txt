abstract
    A heat exchanger for exchanging heat between first and second duct portions of a ventilation system includes first and second heat pipe portions in the first and second duct portions, respectively. Each heat pipe portion can be a heat pipe subassembly including one or more vertical heat pipes fluidly coupled to top and bottom headers, which are respectively connected to the top and bottom headers of the other subassembly to form a refrigerant loop. One or more flow restrictors can block air flow through a respective section of the first or second duct portion. The blocked section can be operatively aligned with a segment of the respective heat pipe portion along which there is a low probability of refrigerant phase change. Each flow restrictor can be an adjustable damper. The damper(s) can be selectively opened and closed as the ventilation system switches between heating and cooling modes.
