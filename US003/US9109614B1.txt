abstract
    Embodiments of the present invention use compressed air to store and deliver electrical, mechanical, and/or thermal power with high round-trip efficiency. Various embodiments may be scalable for use in a variety of environments—from wind farms to power plants to motor vehicles. An energy storage system according to the present invention can operate as a stand-alone storage system that connects electrically to the grid, it can be tightly integrated with a wind turbine, and/or it can be co-located with a thermal power generation facility and operate with even higher efficiency by scavenging low-grade waste heat.
