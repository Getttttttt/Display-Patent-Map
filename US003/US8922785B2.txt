abstract
    A technique for measuring displacement involves passing parallel laser light from a laser light source through a first diffraction grating to a semi-transparent semi-reflective mirror. A portion of the laser light is reflected as first reversed light, which passes through the first diffraction grating. The remainder of the parallel laser light proceeds to a total reflection mirror and is reflected as second reversed light that passes through the semi-transparent semi-reflective mirror and the first diffraction grating. The amount of refracted light of a predetermined order that is of the first and second reversed light and that results from the first diffraction grating is detected by a first optical sensor, and the amount of displacement is obtained from the interference band or a signal thereof corresponding to the amount of relative motion in the axial direction of the total reflection mirror with respect to the semi-transparent semi-reflective mirror.
