abstract
    An embodiment method of controlling a brake lamp of a vehicle equipped with an electric motor as a power source includes determining a position of a following vehicle when decelerating through regenerative braking in a coasting situation and performing at least one of correction of an ON threshold according to deceleration or control of regenerative braking torque for deceleration variation in response to the determined position of the following vehicle being in one of a plurality of regions set according to a distance from a rear of the vehicle.
