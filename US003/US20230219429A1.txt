abstract
    A vehicle drive system includes a battery, at least one drive motor, inverter circuits, a step-up circuit, and a switch. The inverter circuits are configured to drive the at least one drive motor. The step-up circuit is connected between the battery and the inverter circuits. The switch is configured to switch a connection state of the inverter circuits to the step-up circuit between series connection and parallel connection.
