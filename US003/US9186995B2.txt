abstract
    A non-contact power receiving apparatus includes a power reception coil receiving, by electromagnetic resonance, the electric power transmitted from a power transmission coil; a rectifier rectifying the electric power received by the power reception coil, a load receiving the electric power rectified by the rectifier; a resistance and a connection switch provided in a pair of power lines for transmitting the electric power from the power reception coil through the rectifier to the load, the resistance and the connection switch being connected in series between the pair of power lines; and a control device. The control device renders the connection switch conductive when determining where the power reception coil is positioned, and renders the connection switch nonconductive when the electric power is transmitted to the load from the power reception coil through the rectifier.
