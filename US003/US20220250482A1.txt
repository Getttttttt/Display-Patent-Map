abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a method for braking a vehicle, a vehicle including a control unit configured to perform such a method and a computer program element for braking a vehicle. The method for braking a vehicle includes estimating a potential brake energy to be regenerated during a braking event, determining a threshold based on a regenerating capacity of a first axle drive unit, comparing the potential brake energy to be regenerated with the threshold, and switching a second axle drive unit to a regeneration mode for regenerating the brake energy in case the potential brake energy to be regenerated is higher than the threshold.
