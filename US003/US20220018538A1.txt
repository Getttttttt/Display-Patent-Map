abstract
    A method and apparatus for thermal processing of contaminated liquids is disclosed. The system employs an efficient and robust pulse jet burner as its basic energy source. This energy is then used to generate steam which may subsequently be used for a variety of processing and purification steps. A multiple-chamber approach is used: a burner chamber contains the pulse jet burner, a neighboring heat exchanger chamber uses this heat energy to initiate the purification process which started in a third neighboring coagulator chamber into which the contaminated fluids are initially introduced to the system. Combustible liquids which are separated from the contaminated fluids may be used to power the pulse jet for self-contained operation. High temperature flue gases from the pulse jet pass through a supercharger box and then into a vortex dryer which may have a secondary vortex dryer for initial drying of wet solid fuels.
