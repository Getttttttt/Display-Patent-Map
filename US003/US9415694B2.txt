abstract
    A power device of an electric vehicle according to the present invention includes an electricity storage device which stores electricity of direct current, an inverter device which generates alternating current from the direct current stored in the electricity storage device, multiple electric motors which receive supply of electricity of the alternating current generated by the inverter device and generate a traveling driving force, and a driving force transmission mechanism which transmits rotation of each output shaft portion of the multiple electric motors to a driving wheel. The driving force transmission mechanism is configured such that rotation of each output shaft portion is transmitted to the driving wheel with an equal speed change ratio, and the multiple electric motors are connected to a single inverter device, and configured to receive electricity supply of the alternating current generated by the single inverter device.
