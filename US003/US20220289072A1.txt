abstract
    A device for controlling a battery for a vehicle is provided to maintain a battery temperature representing the optimal charging efficiency when the battery reaches a charging time point. The device determines the charging time point of a battery used in a hybrid vehicle and an electric vehicle, and adjusts the battery temperature based on a status of charge (SoC) of the battery at the determined charging time point.
