abstract
    A solar-nuclear hybrid plant includes a nuclear energy loop, a solar energy loop, and an electrical generation loop. The three loops are closed loops. The nuclear energy loop transfers energy to the electrical generation loop through a steam generator. The solar energy loop transfers energy to either the nuclear energy loop and/or the electrical generation loop through one or more heat exchangers in the appropriate loop. This cogeneration plant has higher efficiency compared to a nuclear power plant alone.
