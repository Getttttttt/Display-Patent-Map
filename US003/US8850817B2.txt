abstract
    The invention relates to a method for operating a steam turbine power plant comprising at least one steam generator that is fueled by lignite, wherein the lignite is indirectly dried in a fluidized bed dryer that is heated at least partially with steam from the water-steam circuit of the steam generator. Said method is characterized in that the flue gas from the steam generator undergoes gas scrubbing to remove CO2 and that the energy required for the gas scrubbing is at least partially extracted from the drying process in the fluidized bed. The invention additionally relates to a device for creating steam from lignite comprising a drying system for the lignite and a device to scrub CO2 from the flue gas, wherein the drying process and the CO2 gas scrubbing are thermally coupled to each other.
