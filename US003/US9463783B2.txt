abstract
    A braking apparatus for work machines has at least two brakes, each having at least one braking circuit. The braking circuits can each be actuated via at least one control valve, and the control valves can be controlled independently of one another. A processing unit, by which the control valves can be controlled or regulated, an operating circuit, via which the braking circuits can be controlled or regulated manually, and at least one pressure supply are provided, and the control valves can be controlled or regulated under predetermined conditions by the processing unit.
