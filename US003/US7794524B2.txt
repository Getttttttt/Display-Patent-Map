abstract
    A method and apparatus for removing purifying vaporizable contaminants such as mercury from a particulate material. Particulate material is first contacted with heated gases to vaporize the contaminants and entrain the material in the gases. The gases are directed to a first dust collector to remove the entrained particulates, after which a sorbent or chemical reagent is injected in the gases to interact with the contaminants and form a contaminant containing product that is entrained in the gases. The product is then separated from the gases in a second collector.
