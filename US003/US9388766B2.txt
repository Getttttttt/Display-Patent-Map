abstract
    The invention provides systems and methods for a network of cogenerations systems. In some cases, each system includes at least one cogeneration plant and at least one host facility, where the systems in the network are under the control of a common control system that optimizes a result for the network as a whole. In some cases, each cogeneration system in the network has an individual profile that is used by the control system for controlling that individual cogeneration system. In some cases, one or more of the cogeneration plants is assembled from a set of at least two modular transportable units where the modular units contain sensors that are configured to be ready for transmission of inputs to the common control system with little or no modification when the units are assembled into the final cogeneration plant and actuators or actuator systems that are configured to be ready for reception of outputs from the common control system with little or no modification when the units are assembled into the cogeneration plant.
