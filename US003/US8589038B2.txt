abstract
    A hydraulic drive system for a working machine provides improved safety during forced regeneration. Upon input of a forced regeneration command signal from a forced regeneration switch, a controller detects non-operated states of all hydraulic actuators such as an arm cylinder arranged on a hydraulic excavator based on a lock detection signal from a gate lock detection switch, and also an attitude of a front working mechanism. The attitude is proper from the standpoint of safety. The detection is based on an arm angle signal from an arm angle sensor, a bucket angle signal from a bucket angle sensor and a boom pressure signal from a boom pressure sensor. Taking the detection of the non-operated states and proper attitude as conditions, the controller outputs control signals to a boosting proportional solenoid valve and flow-rate controlling, proportional solenoid valve to make a forced regenerator conduct forced regeneration.
