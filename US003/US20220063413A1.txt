abstract
    The driving range of an electrically powered motor vehicle can be extended by employing a plurality of different types of regenerative power devices on the vehicle for producing electricity and collecting the power generated by each in an efficient module having both DC to DC step up and DC to DC step down converters that output the collected power at a predetermined voltage for selectively providing power to the vehicle's storage battery system or directly to a vehicle accessory.
