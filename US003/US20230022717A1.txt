abstract
    Disclosed is a system configured to deliver power to a load in a transport vehicle, the system having: (a) a battery; (b) a super capacitor bank; (c) a bidirectional DC/DC converter configured to transfer power to/from the super capacitors in order to absorb/supply power from/to the load, and configured to transfer power between the super capacitors and the battery and/or the load in order to charge the super capacitor from the battery or load or charge the battery/load from the super capacitors in a controlled way (d) a hybrid controller, the hybrid controller configured to identify when pulsed power is required to/from the load and instructing the DC/DC converter to supply/absorb power to/from the load from/to the super capacitor bank and to identify when power needs to be transferred between the super capacitor and the battery/load to charge or discharge the battery/load and/or super capacitor.
