abstract
    Systems and methods for generating power for a tractor-trailer combination, including: a drop-lift axle coupled to the bottom of the trailer, the drop-lift axle to deploy at least one wheel when a primary brake is applied and the trailer is operating at a predetermined state; at least one regenerative brake retarder coupled to the at least one wheel, the at least one regenerative brake retarder to generate energy when the at least one wheel is deployed, wherein the at least one regenerative brake retarder acts as an auxiliary brake; and an energy storage system configured to store the energy generated by the at least one regenerative brake retarder, the energy storage system to release the stored energy a main battery to power at least one component of the trailer when needed.
