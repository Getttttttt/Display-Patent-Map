abstract
    A breaker 162 is opened when a pantograph 101 is lowered. The pantograph 101 is connected to an overhead wire 200. Voltage and its phase of the overhead wire are detected by a detector 161. Power is supplied from a power storage device 150 c to a tertiary winding 112 c via a power converter 14 c such that a primary side of the main transformer 110 has the same voltage and phase as the overhead wire so as to reversely excite the main transformer 110. When the voltage of the main transformer 110 has the same phase as the voltage of the overhead wire 200, the breaker 162 is turned on and then the pantograph 101 is raised, to connect the overhead wire 200 and the main transformer 110 to each other, thereby preventing the occurrence of an excitation inrush current to the main transformer 110.
