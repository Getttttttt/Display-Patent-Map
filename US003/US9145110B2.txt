abstract
    A vehicular charging system is provided that includes a battery and a charger region. The system also includes a wireless charger for generating an electric charging signal in the charger region to charge the battery, and a plurality of sensors located to sense foreign objects and living beings in proximity to the charger region. The system further includes a controller for controlling the charger to at least reduce the charging signal when a foreign object or a living being is in proximity to the charger region. The controller may be configured to terminate the charging signal and/or activate an alarm element when a foreign object or a living being is in proximity to the charger region.
