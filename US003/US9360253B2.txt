abstract
    A rotary aluminum kiln temperature regulation system comprising a temperature sensing device in the kiln that is configured to take temperature readings in an area of the kiln in proximity to the temperature sensing device. The system including a wireless transmitter operatively associated with the temperature sensing device and a receiver wirelessly associated with the transmitter, such that the transmitter and receiver wirelessly transmit the temperature readings taken by the temperature sensing device from the transmitter to the receiver. The system also including a control unit operatively connected to the receiver that is configured to receive the transmitted temperature readings and determine when the transmitted temperature readings exceed a predefined temperature set point. The control unit operatives one or more forward feed control loop subsystems that assist in safely operating the kiln in accord with a predetermined temperature profile programmed into the control unit.
