abstract
    A regenerative braking control system for a vehicle can include one or more user interface elements located in a cabin of the vehicle. The user interface element(s) can correspond to a plurality of regenerative braking settings. Each of the regenerative braking setting(s) can correspond to a different amount of regenerative braking torque to apply to the wheel(s) of the vehicle. The system can include a processor operatively connected to the user interface element(s). The processor can be configured to detect a condition, the condition being at least one of a weight of the vehicle, a center of gravity of the vehicle, a weight of a trailer operatively connected to the vehicle, and a center of gravity of a trailer operatively connected to the vehicle. The processor can be configured to cause the amount of regenerative braking torque for the regenerative braking setting(s) to be adjusted based on the condition.
