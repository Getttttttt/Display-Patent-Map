abstract
    A process for keeping coke oven chambers hot during the stoppage of a waste heat boiler. The coke oven chambers are kept hot after emptying using externally heated burners, in which a flue gas low in pollutants is obtained from the burners. The waste heat boilers which, during normal operation, cool the flue gases can be shut off and overhauled, and a flue gas low in pollutants which can be dissipated directly into the atmosphere is obtained by the burner operation. Also disclosed is an apparatus for keeping coke oven chambers hot, the apparatus has a coke oven chamber bench, a flue gas collection line, a flue gas chimney, a waste heat boiler, a waste gas collection line and a waste gas purification system, wherein the flue gas chimney and the waste heat boiler can be shut off on the flue gas side and on the waste gas side.
