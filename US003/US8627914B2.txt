abstract
    Vehicles of embodiments of the invention are propelled by an electric motor (DC or AC motor) coupled to one of the vehicle's axles. The electric motor is powered by two or more electrical storage devices (e.g., batteries or battery banks or capacitors). The electrical storage devices are charged by alternators driven by a rotating flywheel. The flywheel is selectively coupled to a different one of the vehicle axles, such that movement of the vehicle (caused by the electric motor) causes the rotation of the flywheel.
