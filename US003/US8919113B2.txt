abstract
    An energy recovery retrofit kit for a hydraulic control system is disclosed. The energy recover retrofit kit may have a first accumulator and a second accumulator. The energy recover retrofit kit may also have a recovery valve block fluidly connectable between an existing pump and an existing motor of the hydraulic system. The recovery valve block may be configured to selectively fluidly communicate the first and second accumulators with the existing motor.
