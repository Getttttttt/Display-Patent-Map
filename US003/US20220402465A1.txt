abstract
    A speed reduction power unit system includes a main power unit operably connected to a vehicle battery and operably connected to a vehicle transmission via a driveshaft. The main power unit includes a primary motor adapted to convert kinetic energy from the transmission to stored electrical potential energy for recharging the vehicle battery. Secondary power units are operably connected to each wheel. Each secondary power unit includes a secondary motor adapted to convert energy to electrical potential energy. The secondary power unit engages to slow the vehicle and generate electrical energy when the vehicle brake is activated. Each secondary power unit is operably connected to the vehicle battery, such that each secondary unit can recharge the vehicle battery. The secondary power units can include internal batteries and may be removable and independently recharged, then reconnected to the system as needed to provide electrical energy to the primary vehicle battery.
