abstract
    A hydraulic circuit is provided having a hydraulic actuator and a flow control valve. The flow control valve has a pressure adjusting element fluidly coupled to the hydraulic actuator and situated to affect a pressure of fluid being directed to the hydraulic actuator. The flow control valve also has an energy directing element operatively coupled to the pressure adjusting element and situated to be driven by the pressure adjusting element when the pressure adjusting element is selectively throttling fluid being directed to the hydraulic actuator.
