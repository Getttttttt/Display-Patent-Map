abstract
    This disclosure provides a structure of an electric vehicle, which includes an engine, an electric generator for being driven by the engine, a battery for being supplied and charged with generated power at least from the electric generator, and a motor for being supplied with power from the battery to drive driving wheels. The engine, the electric generator, and a power transmission device for transmitting a motive force of the engine to the electric generator are integrally formed to constitute a power generation unit. The power generation unit is arranged inside an engine room so that at least the engine is located rearward from wheel axles of left and right front wheels.
