abstract
    The disclosure relates to a method for operating a hydraulic braking system in a motor vehicle having a regenerative braking function. The method comprises steps that, with respect to at least two wheel brakes, a hydraulic free travel release is carried out such that, with respect to one of the at least two wheel brakes, a hydraulic passage to an accumulator is released in order to store therein at least a volume fraction of the hydraulic fluid in the event of a displacement of a hydraulic fluid. The other of the at least two wheel brakes is hydraulically isolated. The disclosure also relates to a hydraulic braking system for a motor vehicle having a regenerative braking function and a method for controlling said braking system.
