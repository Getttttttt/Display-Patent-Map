abstract
    Systems and methods for controlling the direction of propulsion of an electric vehicle are provided. According to an embodiment, a method can include receiving a first signal from a first user input device; operating an electric motor in a first direction based on the first signal to propel a watercraft in a forward direction; receiving a second signal from a second user input device; and operating the electric motor in a second direction based on the second signal to propel the watercraft in a reverse direction.
