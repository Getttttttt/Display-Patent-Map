abstract
    In order to attain a stable traction control regardless of an inertia change in a driving system, when a driving force transmitted from driving wheels to a road surface is lowered by a certain quantity by torque control, the driving force is lowered according to a transmission torque capacity of a clutch element for connecting and disconnecting a power source and the driving wheels.
