abstract
    A system and a method for controlling shifting stage of a hybrid vehicle may include a speed detecting device that detects a vehicle speed, an automatic transmission that changes a shifting stage of the vehicle, and a shift controller connected to the speed detecting device and the automatic transmission. The shift controller is configured to determine a start of shift control based on a travel environment and a travel state of the vehicle, compares the vehicle speed with a target vehicle speed when the start of the shift control is determined, and performs the shift control based on a state of charge of a battery of the vehicle and a regenerative braking amount of the vehicle when the shift controller concludes that the vehicle speed exceeds the target vehicle speed.
