abstract
    An electric vehicle having an in-wheel motor drive system including: a wheel bearing unit rotatably supporting a drive wheel; a motor unit; and a reducer unit interposed between the motor unit and the wheel bearing unit, a motor torque command value Tmr being calculated from: (i) an estimate ^Te of external force influence on the drive wheel, which is estimated from the motor torque command value Tmr and a rotational frequency ω1 of a driven wheel; and (ii) a correction value Tc which is calculated from a rotational frequency ω2 of the drive wheel, an accelerator signal Tr and the estimate ^Tc.
