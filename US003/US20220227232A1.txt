abstract
    A braking control system includes a regenerative brake controller, a friction brake controller, and a master controller. The regenerative brake controller, in response to absence of expected communication between the master controller and regenerative brake controller, decreases regenerative braking. The master controller, in response to detecting the decrease in regenerative braking, commands the friction brake controller to increase friction braking.
