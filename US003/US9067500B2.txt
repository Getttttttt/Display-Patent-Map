abstract
    Wheels may be equipped with a stator and rotor to induce current to generate electricity as the wheels rotate or to slow down the wheels in response to the application of a brake of the vehicle. Air may be sucked through the wheels through mesh screens to create air flow that passes through ductwork to reach a turbine generator, which generates electricity in response to blade rotation from air flow. A roof mounted solar energy conversion system may generate electricity. A vehicle power supply boosts its energy from all the electricity generated.
