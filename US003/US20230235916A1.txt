abstract
    A total heat exchange element includes partition plates, and spacers shaped into a corrugated shape in which a plurality of apexes are connected by side walls, the partition plates and the spacers being stacked such that extending directions of the plurality of apexes intersect between the spacers adjacent to each other. A plurality of flow paths include flow paths each having a shape which is line-symmetrical with respect to a straight line extending in the stacking direction, and flow paths each having a shape which is not line-symmetrical with respect to a straight line extending in the stacking direction. The length of the side walls constituting the flow paths each having a shape which is not line-symmetrical is longer than the length of the side walls constituting the flow paths having a shape which is line-symmetrical.
