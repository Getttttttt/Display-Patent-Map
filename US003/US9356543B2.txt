abstract
    A power source control apparatus for a rotating electrical machine includes a TRC optimum voltage output portion (21) and a GEN optimum voltage output portion (22) that acquire a TRC optimum voltage and a GEN optimum voltage; a normal target voltage output portion (23) that sets a normal target voltage commonly applied to a traveling motor system and a power generating motor system using a DC/DC converter, based on a highest optimum voltage out of the TRC optimum voltage and the GEN optimum voltage; and a temperature protecting target voltage output portion (24) and a target voltage output portion (25) that limit the voltage commonly applied to the traveling motor system and the power generating motor system to a value lower than the normal target voltage.
