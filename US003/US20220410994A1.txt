abstract
    A system and method are disclosed for retrofitting mechanical workover rigs with electric motors to create a hybrid mechanical and electric drive. The process involves the replacement of the combustion engine with one or more electric motors to drive various components of the rig. The retrofit design allows for cleaner, more precise, and more efficient operations while eliminating the need for hydrocarbons as fuel and thus reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions. It also enables the installation of a computer control which, among other benefits, allows more precise control of the rig's operations than is possible with a mechanical transmission. The electric motors may be driven by a battery energy storage system.
