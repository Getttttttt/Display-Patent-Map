abstract
    A ductless ventilator for monitoring atmospheric conditions and managing airflow between at least two environments to manage temperatures and conserve heat is disclosed in the present invention. The ductless ventilator may have an interior baffle, exterior baffle, fan, heat recovery unit, control interface, and controller, wherein the controller is configured to regulate the operational mode of the ductless ventilator and control operational components of the ductless ventilator according to the parameters of a selected operational mode, the parameters may include the speed and direction of airflow and an operating schedule. The controller may be configured to receive operational instructions, commands, or other input signals from a control interface. The controller may also be configured to receive measurements from communicably connected sensors and regulate operational components of the ductless ventilator in response to the measurements. Two or more ductless ventilators may be communicably connected wherein the two or more ductless ventilators may exchange data including sensors measurements to facilitate optimal temperature management between the environments serviced by the two or more ductless ventilators.
