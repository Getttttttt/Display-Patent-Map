abstract
    An embodiment of a braking system for a vehicle to control a regenerative braking; the braking system is provided with: a plurality of hydraulically operated mechanical brakes; a hydraulic braking circuit connected to the mechanical brakes; a brake pump to raise pressure in the hydraulic braking circuit; a brake pedal mobile between a resting position and a maximal braking position; a connecting cap, which mechanically connects the brake pedal to the brake pump, and is divided into two reciprocally independent parts; an elastic system which tends to push the brake pedal towards the resting position; a position sensor to read the position of a part of the connecting cap integral to the brake pedal; and a pilot system to pilot an energy recovery system for effecting a regenerative braking and uses the position of the part of the connecting cap integral to the brake pedal provided by the position sensor.
