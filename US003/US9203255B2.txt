abstract
    The present invention provides a control method for an electric vehicle, comprising the steps of: measuring a current voltage of a battery cell module and an external temperature immediately before or after a start of charging; determining whether or not charging has been completed by measuring a charging voltage of the battery cell module after charging during a predetermined time set according to at least one of the current voltages and the external temperature; and calculating a voltage variation on the basis of the current voltage and the charging voltage if it is determined that charging has been completed, and determining whether the battery cell module is normal or abnormal on the basis of the voltage variation and a set reference voltage variation.
