abstract
    A controller may control a transfer of electric energy between two or more energy storage devices of a plurality of energy storage devices, at least one energy storage device being disposed onboard a vehicle system, and identify a transfer restriction on the transfer. The controller may change a transfer characteristic based at least in part on the transfer restriction. A system may include a controller to monitor transfer of electric energy between one or more energy storage devices disposed onboard one or more vehicle systems and energy transfer substations that are offboard the one or more vehicle systems. A method may include controlling a transfer of electric energy between two or more energy storage devices, at least one energy storage device being disposed onboard a vehicle system, identifying a transfer restriction on the transfer, and changing a transfer characteristic based at least in part on the transfer restriction.
