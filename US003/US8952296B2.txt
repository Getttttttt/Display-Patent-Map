abstract
    The invention relates to an interior lining for vehicles and aircraft having a carrier and a heating layer and an upper layer, wherein the at least one heating layer is arranged between the carrier and the upper layer, and the heating layer and the upper layer are directly or indirectly interconnected, and to a method for producing such an interior lining, wherein at least one heating layer is pre-laminated onto an upper layer to form a layer composite, and the layer composite is press-laminated, membrane-laminated or vacuum-laminated onto a carrier, or alternatively, in order to produce such an interior lining, a heating layer is pre-laminated onto a carrier to form a carrier/layer composite, and an upper layer is press-laminated, membrane-laminated or vacuum-laminated onto the carrier/layer composite.
