abstract
    A hydraulic brake system includes: a hydraulic pressure source provided for a vehicle, and including a hydraulic-pressure generating device and a reservoir; a plurality of hydraulic brakes provided for respective wheels of the vehicle, and configured to restrain rotations of the respective wheels; and a control valve device including at least one hydraulic-pressure control valve group disposed between the hydraulic-pressure generating device and at least one of brake cylinders of the hydraulic brakes and/or between the reservoir and the at least one of the brake cylinders. Each of the at least one hydraulic-pressure control valve group includes (a) at least one ON/OFF control valve and (b) at least one linear control valve that are disposed in parallel with each other.
