abstract
    A control system includes an electric rotating machine; a driving circuit that is connected to a DC power supply, the driving circuit includes a frequency conversion unit configured such that, when the electric rotating machine is to be driven in a power running mode, the frequency conversion unit converts an output of the DC power supply into AC electric power, and when the electric rotating machine is to be driven in a regenerative operation mode, the frequency conversion unit converts an output of the electric rotating machine into DC electric power; and a control unit that controls the driving circuit, wherein the control unit judges whether a connection between the DC power supply and the driving circuit is being maintained, and is configured such that, when the connection is not being maintained, regenerative electric power generated by the electric rotating machine is reduced by controlling the driving circuit.
