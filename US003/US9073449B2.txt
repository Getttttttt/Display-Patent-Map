abstract
    An efficiency map generating apparatus (100) generates an efficiency map of motors (M) connected to drive wheels of a mobile body and includes an instructed torque detecting unit (111) that detects an instructed torque input for the multiple motors (M), a torque distributing unit (112) that distributes torque to each of the multiple motors (M) based on the instructed torque, a power consumption detecting unit (113) that detects power consumption of the motors (M), a rotation count detecting unit (103) that detects the rotation counts of the motors (M), and an efficiency map generating unit (114) that generates a motor efficiency map (115) based on the torque in multiple combinations, the power consumption, and the rotation counts, where the torque distributing unit (112) causes any of the multiple motors (M) to generate regenerative torque.
