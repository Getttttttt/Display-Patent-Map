abstract
    A charging control apparatus includes a battery, an electric charge mover, and a processor. The battery includes multiple cells. The electric charge mover is configured to move electric charge between the multiple cells. The processor is configured to, upon charging the battery, cause the electric charge mover to move the electric charge of one or more cells serving as a part of the multiple cells to another one or more cells of the multiple cells, and perform a partial charging that charges the one or more cells serving as the part of the multiple cells after causing the electric charge mover to move the electric charge.
