abstract
    A system for storing electrically a regenerative energy of a vehicle is provided. The system includes a first energy storage device, a second energy storage device, an energy regulating device coupled to the first and second energy storage devices, a source of regenerative power configured to capture a regenerative energy during a regenerative power event of the vehicle, and a control unit coupled to the energy regulating device. The control unit is configured to transfer electrical energy from the first energy storage device to the second energy storage device based on a prediction of the regenerative power event using the energy regulating device. The transfer of the electrical energy serves to reduce the electrical energy stored in the first energy storage device thereby enabling the first energy storage device to receive from the regenerative power device when the predicted regenerative power event occurs an amount of the electrical regenerative energy.
