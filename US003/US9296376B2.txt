abstract
    A vehicle brake system is provided with a hydraulic brake device, a regenerative brake device incorporating a generator motor, and a brake control device. The control device includes a section for calculating a driver target brake force for each wheel corresponding to a manipulation amount of a braking manipulation member, a section for enabling the brake control device itself to set compensation brake forces for respective wheels, a section for selecting a larger one of the driver target brake force and the compensation brake force for each wheel and for subtracting a base hydraulic brake force from the selected brake force to set differences for respective wheels as compensated target brake forces for the wheels, and a section for controlling the distribution of the compensated target brake force for each wheel to a controlled hydraulic brake force for each wheel and a regenerative brake force for each driving wheel.
