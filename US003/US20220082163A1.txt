abstract
    A downsized differential assembly having a simple structure, which can be mounted easily on automobiles. The differential assembly comprises a set of first to third gears arranged coaxially while being allowed to rotate relatively to one another. A first eccentric gear meshes with the first gear, a second eccentric gear meshes with the second gear, and a third eccentric gear meshes with the third gear, while being supported by an eccentric member in such a manner as to rotate around an eccentric axis which is offset from a rotational axis. Gear ratios between the first to third gears and the first to third eccentric gears are set to different values so that rotational speeds of the first gear and the second gear are reduced slower than that of the eccentric member.
