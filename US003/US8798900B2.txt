abstract
    A charge point notification system includes a center device and an in-vehicle device disposed in an electric vehicle. The system provides a notification regarding a charge point based on a comparison between a required energy for traveling to a nearby charge point from a node that is close to the nearby charge point, and a remaining energy of the electric vehicle. The system does not generate a notification when the remaining energy is greater than the required energy by an amount greater than a first threshold. The system generates the notification, which is to be provided to the user via the in-vehicle device, when the remaining energy is greater than the required energy by an amount that is in between the first threshold and a second threshold, which is less than the first threshold, and when the nearby charge point exists within a first distance range from the electric vehicle.
