abstract
    A bottoming cycle power system includes a turbo-expander operable to rotate a turbo-crankshaft as a flow of exhaust gas from a combustion process passes through the turbo-expander. A turbo-compressor is operable to compress the flow of exhaust gas after the exhaust gas passes through the turbo-expander. An open cycle absorption chiller system includes an absorber section operable to receive the flow of exhaust gas from the turbo-expander and to mix the flow of exhaust gas with a first refrigerant solution within the absorber section. The first refrigerant solution is operable to absorb water from the exhaust gas as the exhaust gas passes through the first refrigerant solution. The absorber section is operable to route the flow of exhaust gas to the turbo-compressor after the flow of exhaust gas has passed through the first refrigerant solution.
