abstract
    An air conditioner unit includes a housing with an outdoor heat exchanger assembly and an indoor heat exchanger assembly therein. A makeup air intake duct an a makeup are exhaust duct are disposed above the housing parallel to each other. The air conditioner unit also includes a heat exchanger having a first coil and a second coil. The first coil is disposed within the makeup air intake duct. The second coil is disposed with the makeup air exhaust duct. The heat exchanger also includes a first pipe connecting an outlet of the first coil to an inlet of the second coil and a second pipe connecting an outlet of the second coil to an inlet of the first coil.
