abstract
    A portable gas water maker comprises a water maker body with a shell having a hollow structure. A water inlet communicating with the shell and used for injecting water into the shell is formed at an upper end of the water maker body. The water maker body is inverted U-shaped, so that the lower half part of the water maker body is divided into a left cavity and a right cavity. One group of Peltier semiconductor assemblies is arranged in each of the left cavity and the right cavity. A front-end semiconductor and a rear-end semiconductor in each group of Peltier semiconductor assemblies are connected through a wire. The group of semiconductor assemblies in the left cavity is used for generating electricity, and the group of semiconductor assemblies in the right cavity is used for refrigeration.
