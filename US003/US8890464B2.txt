abstract
    A drive system for a grid blower of a vehicle is provided. The system includes: an electrical bus, a grid of resistive elements connected to the electrical bus, the grid of resistive elements configured to thermally dissipate electrical power generated from braking of the vehicle, the electrical power being transmitted on the electrical bus to the grid of resistive elements, an electrical power modulation device configured to modify electrical power received from at least one of the electrical bus and the grid of resistive elements, and a grid blower motor coupled to an output of the electrical power modulation device, wherein a speed of the grid blower motor varies based on the electrical power that has been modified by the electrical power modulation device.
