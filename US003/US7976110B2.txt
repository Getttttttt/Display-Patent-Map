abstract
    A hybrid braking system that operates in conjunction with a foundation braking system, whether an air, hydraulic, electric, mechanical or electric braking system. Recovered energy is returned to the axle wheels in a controlled manner while the vehicle is in motion and certain criteria are met so as to compensate for aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance for instance but not at a rate to accelerate or launch a vehicle.
