abstract
    The present disclosure relates to controlling transfer of electrical energy in a coupling between a first vehicle and a second vehicle of a vehicle combination, each of the first and second vehicles having an electric machine and an energy storage system, wherein at least the electric machine of the second vehicle is operable in a traction mode and a generator mode for generating electrical energy during a regenerative braking event of the second vehicle, the method comprising determining an amount of possible excessive energy from the braking event of the second vehicle, determining a total energy level of the second vehicle, determining a total energy level of the first vehicle, comparing the determined amount of possible excessive energy with the determined total energy levels of the first vehicle and second vehicle, and controlling direction of the transfer of electrical energy between the first and second vehicle based on the comparison.
