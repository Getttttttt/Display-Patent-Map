abstract
    The present invention relates to an electric device for driving mechanical equipment comprising an alternating current motor and an inverter, the said inverter comprising, for each phase of the said motor, an H bridge structure comprising four switching elements distributed over two branches connecting two terminals of the said H bridge structure and intended to supply the winding of the said at least one phase of the motor, the said winding being a winding with a mid point and the said electric device being characterized in that it also comprises, for each phase of the said motor, an energy storage unit, in particular a supercondenser, connected, on the one hand, to the mid point of the winding of the concerned phase of the motor and, on the other hand, to a terminal of the H bridge structure supplying the said winding.
