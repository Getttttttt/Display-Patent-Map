abstract
    A vehicle control system for reducing turn radius of a vehicle may include a controller and a torque control module operably coupled to the controller and to front wheels of a front axle of the vehicle and rear wheels of a rear axle of the vehicle. The controller may also be operably coupled to components and/or sensors of the vehicle to receive information including vehicle wheel speed and steering wheel angle. The torque control module may be operable, responsive to control by the controller, to apply a negative torque to an inside rear wheel during a turn and apply a positive torque to the front axle during the turn to compensate for the negative torque applied to the inside rear wheel to reduce the turn radius based on the steering wheel angle and the vehicle speed.
