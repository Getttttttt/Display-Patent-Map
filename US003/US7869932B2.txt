abstract
    Systems and methods are described for controlling engine operation of an engine that may be shut-down during engine idle stop conditions. The engine may include a high pressure direct injection fuel system. In one embodiment, a method stops the engine when a temperature of a fuel rail is below a threshold during a selected engine idle stop condition. On the other hand, when the temperature of the fuel rail is above the threshold, engine operation is maintained during the selected engine idle stop condition.
