abstract
    A supercritical hydrothermal combustion device comprises a main enclosure and a top cap. A partition is mounted in the main enclosure and divides the interior of the main enclosure into a main combustion space and a mixing space. The top cap is provided with a primary fuel inlet, an oxidant inlet and a secondary fuel inlet. A high-temperature ignition bar sleeve, having a high-temperature ignition bar arranged therein, is disposed in the top cap. A combustion sleeve, having a stable combustion space formed therein, is mounted at a bottom of the top cap, and has a top communicated with the high-temperature ignition bar sleeve and the oxidant inlet, as well as a bottom communicated with the main combustion space. The secondary fuel inlet and a secondary oxidant inlet are communicated with the main combustion space. Supercritical hydrothermal combustion is realized to generate a hybrid thermal fluid or treat organic wastes.
