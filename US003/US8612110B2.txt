abstract
    A traveling vehicle system includes traveling vehicles; a controller which controls operations of the traveling vehicles; and a power line which electrically connects the traveling vehicles with each other, and supplies electric power to each of the traveling vehicles. Each of the traveling vehicles includes a motor which runs on the electric power supplied via the power line and drives the traveling vehicle, and when decelerating, generates regenerative electric power to be supplied to another one of the traveling vehicles via the power line, and the controller controls the operations of the traveling vehicles so that a time of one or more first traveling vehicles decelerating overlaps a time of one or more second traveling vehicles accelerating, the first traveling vehicles being decelerating traveling vehicles, the second traveling vehicles being accelerating traveling vehicles, and the first traveling vehicles and the second traveling vehicles being included in the traveling vehicles.
