abstract
    The air cooling system and method for a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) inlet provides a combined cycle power plant utilizing a powerful fan coupled to ductwork connected to pipes that enter the HRSG inlet duct coupled to an exhaust duct of a Combustion Turbine (CT) for lowering the temperature of the CT exhaust gas provided to the heat recovery steam generator by the CT. The cool air injection system is utilized during low load operation or startup of the CT to ensure that spray water from an inter-stage desuperheater in an HRSG is fully evaporated prior to entering the downstream superheater or reheater. A feedback system includes temperature elements measuring the mix temperature that regulates the cooling air injection rate into the HRSG inlet.
