abstract
    A power supply system includes a main power storage device and a plurality of sub power storage devices. A converter is connected to a selected one of the sub power storage devices to convert voltage between the selected sub power storage device and an electric power feeding line bidirectionally. The sub power storage device undergoes a connection switching process, and when the last sub power storage device is currently used, then, in accordance with that sub power storage device's SOC and the vehicle's state, a request is generated to disconnect the sub power storage device and a relay is turned off. In doing so, if a process is currently performed for starting or stopping an engine, generating the request is refrained even if a decreased SOC is sensed. Similarly, if a process is performed to disconnect a sub power storage device, and therewhile a request is generated to start/stop the engine, starting the process performed for starting or stopping the engine is refrained.
