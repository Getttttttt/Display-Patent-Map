abstract
    A powertrain for propelling a hybrid vehicle includes a front drivetrain, for driving a pair of front wheels, and a rear drivetrain, for driving a first and a second rear wheel, to propel the hybrid vehicle. First and second rear drive motors are operatively connected to the rear wheels to propel the hybrid vehicle. Energy is transmitted from an energy storage device to power and operate each of the first and second rear drive motors. Likewise, during regenerative braking, energy is transmitted from each of the rear drive motors to recharge the energy storage device. The first rear drive motor is operated independent of the second rear drive motor to transmit torque to vector torque between each of the rear wheels and control dynamics of the hybrid vehicle.
