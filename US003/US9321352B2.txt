abstract
    An integrated truck and trailer power system comprises auxiliary power generation and storage devices mounted on a trailer, such as an array of solar panels mounted on the roof of the trailer and a storage battery mounted on the trailer, and switching devices for controlling flow of power there between and to an electrically powered HVAC system of the truck, whereby the truck can be maintained at a comfortable temperature by supply of power stored by the auxiliary power storage device.
