abstract
    The invention described herein represents a significant improvement in the efficiency of heating and cooling processes for applications such as buildings. The working fluid condensation process is time separated from the working fluid vaporization process. Work on the working fluid through a phase transformation is performed at a first time and the heating or cooling of a building through a reverse phase transformation is done at a second time. A storage medium is provided to store the capacity to heat or the capacity to cool in the form of the phase transformed working fluid stored at a positive or a negative pressure. Controlling logic calculates what the heating and cooling load will be in the future and when least expensive and most efficient operating times are forecasted to be. The compression or vacuum energy input phase of operation is be performed during the most optimal window as seldom as once per week while the application heating or cooling process is performed continuously as needed.
