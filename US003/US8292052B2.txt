abstract
    A contactless power transfer system for a mobile asset is presented. The system includes a primary loop disposed adjacent to a location that is coupled to a power source. A secondary receiving coil is disposed on the mobile asset and coupled to a traction motor for receiving power from the primary loop. The power transfer system further includes a field-focusing element that can focus a magnetic field from the primary loop onto the secondary receiving coil, the field-focusing element having a non-linear current distribution.
