abstract
    A method for improving pulp mill steam cycle efficiency includes the steps of providing at least one deaerator tank having a first pressure, and lowering the pressure of said deaerator tank to a second pressure. Feedwater is supplied to a pre-economizer, where it is heated. The water is then delivered to at least one feedwater heater, where it is heated. The water is then delivered to an economizer. By this method boiler steam rate is increased while boiler efficiency is maintained and turbine extraction for deaerator and feedwater heating is minimized.
