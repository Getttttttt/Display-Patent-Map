abstract
    A low-carbon energy utilization system for steam and power cogeneration of oil field is provided, which includes a first water pump device, a second water pump device, electric heating devices, a liquid mixer, a fossil-fuel steam injection boiler, a steam mixer, a super-heater, and a new energy generation station. The electric heating devices are connected to the first water pump device. The liquid mixer is connected to the second water pump device and the electric heating devices. The fossil-fuel steam injection boiler is connected to the liquid mixer. The steam mixer is connected to the electric heating devices and the fossil-fuel steam injection boiler. The super-heater is connected to the steam mixer. The new energy generation station is used for supplying power to the electric heating devices.
