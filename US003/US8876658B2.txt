abstract
    In an electrically driven vehicle propelled by an electric machine (motor)equipped with a collaborative braking system of regenerative and frictional braking capacities, in order to achieve the “rollback prevention” at starting on an sloping road, when the regenerative braking is not available due to charging restriction to battery, frictional braking is used instead of regenerative braking and wheels are (automatically, i.e. not manually by driver) braked with friction to prevent the rollback. Moreover, in addition to braking wheels by frictional braking, further control is performed to adjust and match the magnitude of frictional braking force to a braking force in accordance with the starting operation. Thus, at the time of rollback prevention by the frictional braking as well, the similar prevention of rollback will be possible as the prevention by way of regenerative braking such that the effect of rollback prevention may be achieved without a feel of discomfort.
