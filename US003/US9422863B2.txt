abstract
    A method and architecture for recombining power of a turbomachine improving on problems of size, mass, or reliability. In the method energy is recovered in an exhaust nozzle and converted and recirculated using a mechanical and/or electrical power recombining mechanism. An example of an architecture of a turbomachine includes a main turbine engine and a heat exchanger positioned in the exhaust nozzle and coupled, via pipes, to an independent system that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy. This independent system is connected to a localized mechanical recombination mechanism via a power shaft to supply power to a power transmission shaft according to aircraft requirements.
