abstract
    A system for reducing the temperature of waste heat from a waste heat source of a vehicle engine, including an open loop Brayton cycle having a cooler, a compressor, a turbine, and a shaft coupling the compressor to the turbine. Waste heat and compressed air from the compressor flow through the cooler, thereby transferring heat from the waste heat to the compressed air and lowering the temperature of the waste heat. The heated and compressed air is expanded across the turbine, to cause rotation of the shaft, thereby powering rotation of the compressor. Excess power beyond that necessary to drive the compressor may be drawn off through a generator which has its rotor mounted on the same shaft as the compressor and turbine.
