abstract
    A braking control device is applied to, for example, a vehicle in which a regenerative braking force is generated on a front wheel by a regenerative generator provided on the front wheel. The braking control device includes an actuator configured to individually generate a front wheel friction braking force on the front wheel and a rear wheel friction braking force Fmr on a rear wheel of the vehicle; and a braking controller configured to control the actuator. In the braking control device, the braking controller is configured to regulate the front and rear wheel friction braking forces based on a normative regenerative force corresponding to a rotation speed equivalent value equivalent to a rotation speed of the regenerative generator.
