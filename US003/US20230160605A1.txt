abstract
    A furnace for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit includes a heat exchange tube configured to flow combustion products therethrough and place the combustion products in a heat exchange relationship with an air flow directed across the heat exchange tube. The furnace also includes a burner assembly fluidly coupled to a first port of the heat exchange tube and configured to generate the combustion products directed into the heat exchange tube via the first port, and a draft inducer blower fluidly coupled to a second port of the heat exchange tube and configured to draw the combustion products through the heat exchange tube. The burner assembly is higher in position than the draft inducer blower relative to a base of the HVAC unit.
