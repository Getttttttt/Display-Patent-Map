abstract
    An energy estimation device includes: an energy change quantity estimation unit that estimates an energy change quantity of a vehicle for each of links; an axle torque calculation unit that calculates, based upon the estimated energy change quantity, an axle torque of the vehicle for a regeneration link in which energy is regenerated upon traveling of the vehicle; an allocation ratio calculation unit that calculates, based upon the calculated axle torque, an allocation ratio of a regeneration brake relative to a friction brake of the vehicle for the regeneration link; and a regeneration energy estimation unit that estimates regeneration energy of the vehicle for the regeneration link based upon the energy change quantity and the allocation ratio.
