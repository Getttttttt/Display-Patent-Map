abstract
    A bicycle regenerative brake control device is provided for controlling a motor, in relation to a brake mechanism that can be mounted on an electric bicycle in which human-powered driving is assisted by the motor. The bicycle regenerative brake control device basically includes a first control part, a second control part and a switch control part. The first control part controls the motor so as to generate a uniform first regenerative braking force. The second control part controls the motor so as to generate a gradually increasing second regenerative braking force upon determining the brake mechanism shifts from an initial state to a braking state. The switch control part switches to a control performed by the second control part in response to the brake mechanism shifting from the initial state to the braking state while control is being performed by the first control part.
