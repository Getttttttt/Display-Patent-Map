abstract
    An energy recovery ventilation device includes a housing having a first side, a second side opposite the first side. The device also includes at least one first channel within the housing, and at least one second channel within the housing. The device includes a first inlet and a first outlet. The first inlet is fluidly coupled to the first outlet via the first channel. The device also includes a second inlet and a second outlet. The second inlet is fluidly coupled to the second outlet via the second channel. The device includes a first cover supported by the first side of the housing. The first cover is made of a first material. The device also includes a second cover supported by the second side of the housing. The second cover is made of a second material that is different than the first material.
