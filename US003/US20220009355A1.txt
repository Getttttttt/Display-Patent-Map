abstract
    The present disclosure to provides a vehicle capable of efficiently charging electric energy by determining a regenerative braking control improved for a driving situation in which the vehicle is driving, and a control method thereof.The vehicle includes: a power supply including a battery; a motor driven by receiving power from the battery; and a controller configured to determine a vehicle information including a charging state information of the battery, a temperature information of the battery, an input frequency of a braking command, and a driving history data, to determine a road information including a road condition information and a slope information of the road, to charge the battery by determining a regenerative braking level of the motor based on the vehicle information or the road information.
