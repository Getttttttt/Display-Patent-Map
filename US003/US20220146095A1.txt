abstract
    A low nitrogen coupling combustion system for the disposal of waste stink gas and solid waste including a waste pit, at least one stink gas incineration equipment and a waste incinerator, wherein the waste pit is equipped with stink gas outlets and the stink gas incineration equipment is provided with an incineration chamber for burning stink gas, as well as a stink gas inlet, a fuel inlet and a burned stink gas outlet which are connected with the incineration chamber; the stink gas inlet is connected with the stink gas outlet of the waste pit through a stink gas delivery pipe, and the fuel inlet is connected with a fuel source through a fuel delivery pipe; the burned stink gas outlet is connected with a combustion-supporting air inlet of the waste incinerator through a flue gas discharge pipe.
