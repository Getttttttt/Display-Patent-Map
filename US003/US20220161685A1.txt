abstract
    A motor vehicle has a motor performing power driving and regeneration. The motor includes an inverter, a first power storage device suppling energy to the motor, a power converter and a circuit. The converter has a voltage step down function during the power driving and a voltage step up function during the regeneration. The power converter, with the voltage step down function during the power driving, is connected in the circuit to the first power storage device. During the power driving of the motor, the power converter steps down an output voltage of the first power storage device to supply the energy from the first power storage device to the inverter. During the regeneration in the motor, the power converter steps up a DC voltage of the inverter to recover regenerated energy into the first power storage device.
