abstract
    A method for regulating the speed at which an electric vehicle descends a hill includes determining a position of a shift lever and determining if the vehicle accelerator and/or the vehicle brake are depressed. If the vehicle is in either drive or reverse and neither the vehicle accelerator nor the vehicle brake is depressed, a change in the motor speed is determined based on the current motor speed and a reference motor speed. The current braking assist is then adjusted based on the change in the motor speed such that the motor speed, and therefore the speed of the electric vehicle, remains constant as the vehicle descends the hill.
