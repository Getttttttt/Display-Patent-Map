abstract
    A waste heat recovery system for an engine system includes a first charge air cooler in communication with a working fluid path of the waste heat recovery system. The first charge air cooler includes a first waste heat recovery core and a first cooling fluid core. The first waste heat recovery core includes a first working fluid inlet configured to receive a working fluid from the working fluid path. The first working fluid conduit is coupled to the first working fluid inlet and a first working fluid outlet. The first cooling fluid core includes a first cooling fluid inlet in fluid communication with a cooling fluid source and a first cooling fluid conduit fluidly coupled to the first cooling fluid inlet and a first cooling fluid outlet. The first cooling fluid conduit is configured to direct cooling fluid from the first cooling fluid inlet to the first cooling fluid outlet.
