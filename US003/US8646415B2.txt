abstract
    The present invention is a system and method for generating a mixture of steam and combustion gas in a direct contact rotating steam generator, using high solids content water, and without waste liquid discharge. The invention includes removing the solids with controllable water content in a stackable form. The system includes a longitudinally rotatable and controlled pressure enclosure being mounted at a slope and having a steam producing section, a water injection section and a discharge section. The enclosure can include a mixing and mobilizing rotating element to enhance the mixture and the heat transfer. The system can have an additional wet section to scrub contaminates and produce saturated steam. The system can be integrated with an enhanced oil recovery facility or with an open mine oil facility that generates non-segregate tailings to consume their discharge liquid waste and generate steam, heat and a stable solids waste.
