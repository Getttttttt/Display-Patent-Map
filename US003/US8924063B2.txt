abstract
    The present invention aims to enhance fuel economy without imparting a sense of discomfort to a driver who drives a vehicle. A determination unit determines whether a depression amount of an accelerator pedal is equal to or lower than a first threshold value set beforehand, when a clutch is disengaged and electric power is regenerated. A clutch control unit controls the engagement or the disengagement of the clutch in such a manner as keeping the disengagement of the clutch, when the depression amount of the accelerator pedal is determined to be equal to or lower than the first threshold value, and engaging the clutch when the depression amount of the accelerator pedal is determined to exceed the first threshold value. The present invention can be applied to a hybrid vehicle.
