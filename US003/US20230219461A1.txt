abstract
    An apparatus and method for electrochemical energy storage for high-power and high-energy autonomous applications, including autonomous electric vehicles having remote active drive cycle monitoring and/or governance and thermal management control, are described. For autonomous vehicles, the apparatus includes: at least one high-power, low-energy density tertiary storage battery having low cost, and designed to wear and be replaceable; at least one high energy density core battery; at least one intermediate power and energy density secondary battery for buffering the load on the core battery; and a battery controller. The autonomous vehicle energy requirement and consumption rate are provided in such a manner that performance degradation over the life of the system is reduced.
