abstract
    An apparatus for transferring energy using onboard power electronics with high-frequency transformer isolation includes a power electronic drive circuit comprises a dc bus and a first energy storage device coupled to the dc bus. A first bi-directional dc-to-ac voltage inverter is coupled to the first energy storage device and to the dc bus, and a first electromechanical device coupled to the first bi-directional dc-to-ac voltage inverter. A charging system coupled to the dc bus via a charge bus comprises a receptacle configured to mate with a connector coupled to a voltage source external to the power electronic drive circuit and an isolation transformer configured to electrically isolate the charge bus from the receptacle. A controller configured to cause the charging system to supply a charging voltage to the dc bus based on a voltage received from the voltage source external to the power electronic drive circuit.
