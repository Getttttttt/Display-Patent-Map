abstract
    Systems and methods are disclosed that can include operating a first rig component at a first location, capturing waste energy from the first rig component at the first location, and redirecting the waste energy to another rig component, another location, or a combination thereof. A method of operating a drilling rig can include operations of determining a power usage profile for a rig based on a digital rig plan; predicting waste energy to be generated during execution of the digital rig plan; and modifying the power usage profile for the rig and the digital rig plan based on the predicted waste energy.
