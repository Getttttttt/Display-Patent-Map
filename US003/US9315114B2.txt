abstract
    A device for controlling an electric vehicle includes: a feedforward computation unit that is configured to input a motor torque instruction value and compute a first torque target value by feedforward computation; and a motor torque control unit that is configured to control a motor torque according to the first torque target value. The feedforward computation unit includes: a vehicle model which is configured to input the motor torque instruction value to model a characteristic from the motor torque to a drive shaft torsional angular velocity; and a drive shaft torsional angular velocity feedback model which is configured to feed back the drive shaft torsional angular velocity output from the vehicle model to the motor torque instruction value to compute the first torque target value.
