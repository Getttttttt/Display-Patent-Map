abstract
    A brake pedal unit for coupling to a brake pedal includes a housing and a pedal simulator housed within a simulation chamber formed in the housing. The pedal simulator includes a spring for providing force feedback. A first piston is mounted in the housing. The first piston is operable to generate brake actuating pressure at a first pressure output. A second piston is mounted in the housing. The first piston is operable to generate brake actuating pressure at a second pressure output. An input piston is connected to operate the pedal simulator during a normal braking mode, and wherein the input piston is coupled to actuate the first and second pistons during a manual push-though mode.
