abstract
    An apparatus for performing regenerative braking by controlling a disconnector of a vehicle includes a computing device to calculate a braking amount necessary for braking, a controller to engage or release the disconnector of the vehicle, based on the calculated braking amount, and a distributing device to distribute a regenerative braking amount necessary for braking into at least one motor included in the vehicle, when the disconnector is engaged or released.
