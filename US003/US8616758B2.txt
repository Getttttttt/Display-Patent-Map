abstract
    A mixer drum driving device includes a hydraulic motor that rotates a mixer drum, a first hydraulic pump that is driven by an engine to be capable of supplying working oil to the hydraulic motor, an electric motor, a power supply connected to the electric motor, a second hydraulic pump capable of supplying the working oil to the hydraulic motor on the basis of a driving force of the motor, and a flow dividing valve that divides the working oil discharged from the first hydraulic pump and supplies the working oil to the hydraulic motor and the second hydraulic pump. The second hydraulic pump is configured to rotate the electric motor using the working oil. The electric motor is configured to generate electric power so as to charge the power supply when driven to rotate by the second hydraulic pump.
