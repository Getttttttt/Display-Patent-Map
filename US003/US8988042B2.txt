abstract
    In a vehicle (100), a power storage device (110) mounted thereon can be charged with electric power transmitted from an external power supply device (500, 500A) via a power cable (400, 400A). The vehicle (100) includes a PLC communication unit (230) for establishing PLC communication with the external power supply device (500, 500A) via the power cable (400). An ECU (300) starts transmission of a signal from the PLC communication unit (230) to the external power supply device (500, 500A) in response to connection of the power cable (400) to an inlet (220). When a response from the external power supply device (500, 500A) to the signal is not received, the ECU (300) switches a CCID (430, 540) provided in the power cable (400) or the external power supply device (500A) to a state in which supply of the electric power is possible, and thereafter, retransmits the signal from the PLC communication unit (230) to the external power supply device (500, 500A).
