abstract
    An air-to-air heat recovery core, comprising: a core assembly having parallel first and second channels that are open to first and second sides of the core assembly, respectively, the first and second channels interleaved, and each first channel sharing a wall with an adjacent second channel; first and second sealants formed along opposite first and second edges, respectively, of the core assembly perpendicular to a running direction of the first and second channels, the first and second sealants respectively blocking first and second ends of the channels; and first and second panels secured to first and second sides of the core assembly, respectively, the first and second panels blocking a middle portion of the first and second channels, respectively, such that air can enter and leave the first and second channels via the first and second end portions of the first and second channels but not via the middle portions.
