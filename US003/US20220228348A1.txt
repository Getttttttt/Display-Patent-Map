abstract
    The available power surge capacity of a battery is detected. The available steady state regeneration energy capacity of the battery is also detected. The available battery generation power, available from an electric motor, is detected as well. The generation power available from the electric motor is applied to regenerate (or recharge) the battery based upon the available power surge capacity, and the available steady state capacity of the battery.
