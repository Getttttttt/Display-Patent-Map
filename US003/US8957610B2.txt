abstract
    A multi-port reconfigurable battery has at least one bank of statically joined series connected battery cells, each including a positive and negative pole connected through switches to respective output connections on at least one port. Processor controlled switches reconfigure the cells to provide power for electrical loads on one or more ports and simultaneously provide charging on one or more other ports. An alternative configuration divides groups of series connected cells into separate battery banks that permit other configurations. Ports are configurable to share one electrically common connection with other ports providing a simplified configuration (multi-tap reconfigurable battery). Applications include selectable motor speed control and battery regeneration schemes matched to motor output, and single or multiphase AC power output at selectable frequencies for use as an Uninterruptible Power Supply. The battery is also described as a power source for a forced-air induction system (e.g. electric supercharger) for a combustion engine.
