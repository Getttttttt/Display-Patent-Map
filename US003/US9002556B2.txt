abstract
    A torque response control apparatus for an electric motor of a vehicle comprises a motor torque response control means that is configured to carry out finding a difference between a required acceleration that is variable in accordance with a change of a vehicle driving condition and an actual acceleration that is obtained, at the time of the change of the vehicle driving condition, with the aid of a torque characteristic of the electric motor, the difference being caused by the torque characteristic of the electric motor in which the maximum torque is varied in accordance with a rotation speed of the electric motor; and controlling the torque response of the electric motor in a manner to cause a driver to feel the difference of the actual acceleration from the required acceleration to be small by compensating the difference between the required acceleration and the actual acceleration.
