abstract
    A motor drive system includes a first interlock mechanism configured to be activated in response to transition to an operable state of an interruption device, to open an open/close device, a second interlock mechanism configured to be activated in response to transition to an openable state of a case containing a power control unit, to open the open/close device, and a control device. The control device is configured to perform, when the first interlock mechanism is activated, a first process of opening the open/close device after shutting down the power control unit, and to perform, when the second interlock mechanism is activated, a second process of opening the open/close device while driving the power control unit, instead of the first process, depending on a counter electromotive voltage generated by a motor.
