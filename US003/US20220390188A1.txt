abstract
    A heat exchange system includes a first heat exchanger subassembly, a second heat exchanger subassembly, a first nozzle configured to spray fluid at the first heat exchanger subassembly, and a second nozzle configured to spray fluid at the second heat exchanger subassembly. The heat exchange system further includes memory storing controller-executable instructions and a controller configured to execute the instructions, which cause the controller to activate the first nozzle when an outdoor temperature is below a threshold temperature, and activate the first nozzle and the second nozzle when the outdoor temperature is above the threshold temperature.
