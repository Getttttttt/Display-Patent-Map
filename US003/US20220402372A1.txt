abstract
    A process to control a drive assembly includes the steps of providing a mathematical model associating a first quantity indicative of a torque delivered by a motor-generator with a second quantity indicative of a linear acceleration of a wheel hub unit, which receives the torque, acquiring a first signal indicative of the second quantity, determining a target signal of the first quantity by means of the mathematical model based on the acquired first signal, so that the torque indicated by the target signal involves at least a decrease in a difference between the second quantity and a reference, and controlling the motor-generator according to the determined target signal.
