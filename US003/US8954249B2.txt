abstract
    A braking force control apparatus for a vehicle estimates the friction coefficient μ of a road surface as the state of the road surface on which the vehicle travels, and determines an ideal braking force μW by making use of the estimated road surface friction coefficient μ. When μ is equal to or greater than a predetermined friction coefficient μ0, the braking force control apparatus operates an in-wheel motor in a regeneration state to generate a motor braking torque Tmr, and causes a friction brake mechanism to generate a frictional braking force Bf computed by subtracting Tmr from μW. When μ is less than μ0, the braking force control apparatus operates the in-wheel motor in a power running state to generate a motor driving torque Tmc, and causes the friction brake mechanism to generate a Bf computed by adding Tmc to μW.
