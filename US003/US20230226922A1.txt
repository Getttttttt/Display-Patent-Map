abstract
    A vehicle control system includes a first vehicle sensor configured to monitor a condition of a battery pack; a second vehicle sensor configured to monitor a torque request; and a braking control circuit communicably coupled to the first vehicle sensor and the second vehicle sensor. The braking control circuit is configured to (i) determine an operating mode for a braking system based on the battery condition and the torque request, and (ii) control the braking system based on the operating mode.
