abstract
    A control method and unit of an electric traction motorcycle; there are provided: an accelerator grip pivotally mounted to rotate in a first rotation direction and about a rotation axis from a neutral position towards a maximum acceleration position; an elastic member which tends to keep the accelerator grip in the neutral position; at least one position sensor for detecting the angular position of the accelerator grip about the rotation axis; and a control device which drives an electric machine of the motorcycle according to the angular position of the accelerator grip; the accelerator grip is mounted to rotate in a second rotation direction opposite to the first rotation direction and about the rotation axis from the neutral position towards a deceleration position which is arranged in the direction opposite to the maximum acceleration position with respect to the neutral position.
