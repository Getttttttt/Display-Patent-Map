abstract
    A method of controlling an electrified vehicle to prevent a collision thereof includes: determining whether an accelerator pedal is erroneously operated in the situation in which an obstacle is detected to be present in a traveling path; and when it is determined that the accelerator pedal is erroneously operated, performing braking control such that at least one of hydraulic braking or regenerative braking is selectively performed in a plurality of braking sections determined based on a current vehicle speed and a distance to the obstacle.
