abstract
    A structure for utilizing exhaust heat of a vehicle is provided. The structure includes a first part that has an exhaust pipe in which exhaust gas having a predetermined temperature passes through and which is heated by exchanging heat with the exhaust gas. A bypass passageway is installed within the exhaust pipe and the exhaust gas is bypassed through the bypass passageway. A thermoelectric element is attached to an exterior of the exhaust pipe, formed by bonding a P-type semiconductor and an N-type semiconductor, and produces electricity using a thermoelectric effect. A second part is attached to the exterior of the thermoelectric element and coolant flows therein. A first exhaust gas passageway is installed in the second part in a longitudinal direction and the exhaust gas passes through the first exhaust gas passageway to heat the coolant.
