abstract
    An electric drive module for a motor vehicle includes an electric motor, a first input member, a first output member and a two-speed module selectively drivingly interconnecting the first input member and the first output member at one of two different drive ratios. A reduction unit includes a second input member being driven by the first output member and has a second output member being driven at a reduced speed relative to the second input member. A differential assembly has an input driven by said second output member. A first differential output drives a first output shaft, and a second differential output drives a second output shaft.
