abstract
    A power supply system that supplies electric power to a load includes a first power storage device, a second power storage device, a power line for transmitting electric power input and output to and from the load, a converter for executing bidirectional DC voltage conversion between the first power storage device and the power line, and a switch connected between the second power storage device and the power line. When the switch is OFF, the control device performs voltage control of the converter so that a voltage value of the power line becomes a voltage command value, and when the switch is ON, the control device performs current control of the converter so that a current value of the first power storage device becomes a current command value.
