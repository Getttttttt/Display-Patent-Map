abstract
    A modular electric vehicle comprising a single module(s) with an electric driving system and a vehicle control unit, the modular vehicle is configured to be selectively articulated to a master vehicle and to be controlled from a selectable control source via the vehicle control unit either in a first, articulated mode, or in a second, autonomous mode. The control source may be selected to be in communication with a first gateway installed at the master vehicle or a second gateway installable at the modular vehicle. The modular electric vehicle may comprise a pair of single modules coupled to one another in tandem and in data and control communication with one another. The modules may each be configured to serve a master or a slave vehicle, so that any of the modules may serve a master vehicle, whenever required for the autonomous mode.
