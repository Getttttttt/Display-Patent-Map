abstract
    An electric power hybrid propulsion generation system for a motor vehicle which comprises a wind turbine rotatively mounted on a roof of the motor vehicle. Two independent electric generators are in the motor vehicle. Two drive belt assemblies extend between the wind turbine and the electric generators. An auxiliary battery array in the motor vehicle is electrically connected to the electric generators. An electric motor drive in the motor vehicle is powered by the auxiliary battery array to operate rear wheels of the motor vehicle independently from a fuel engine and transmission of the motor vehicle, which operates front wheels of the motor vehicle.
