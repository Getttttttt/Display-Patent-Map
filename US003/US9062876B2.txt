abstract
    An energy generation system including a primer mover producing a power output, and a combustion product outlet stream; and a steam generator wherein a water inlet stream and the combustion product outlet stream exchange heat to produce at least one steam outlet stream is provided. The steam generator further comprises at least one set of supplemental burners situated in the path of the combustion product outlet stream, and a hydrogen fuel inlet stream at least a portion of which is combusted in at least one of the supplemental burners or the prime mover.
