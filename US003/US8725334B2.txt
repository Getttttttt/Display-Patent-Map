abstract
    A method for controlling torque applied to wheels of a vehicle including at least one electric motor connected to a battery and connected to at least one driving wheel. The motor is capable of operating as a generator for recharging the battery when the vehicle slows down. A first braking adjustment travel and a second acceleration adjustment travel are applied to the movement of the acceleration pedal of the vehicle, the braking adjustment travel being a continuously decreasing function relative to the charge of the battery.
