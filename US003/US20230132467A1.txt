abstract
    A heat exchanger includes a case, fins, and heat transfer tubes. Combustion exhaust gas passes downward in the case. The fins are disposed at a lower portion of the case and arranged in the first direction. Each of the fins includes a first end and a second end that is an opposite end from the first end in a second direction intersecting the first direction. Each of the fins includes through holes in which the heat transfer tubes are inserted. Each of the fins includes heat receiving portions arranged in the second direction and connecting portion connecting the heat receiving portions. The heat receiving portions include a first heat receiving portion disposed at the first end. The first heat receiving portion includes a first recessed portion recessed from an outer edge of an upper part of the first heat receiving portion.
