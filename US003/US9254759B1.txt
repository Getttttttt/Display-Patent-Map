abstract
    Electromechanical systems using magnetic fields to induce eddy currents and generate lift are described. Magnet configurations which can be employed in the systems are illustrated. The magnet configuration can be used to generate lift and/or thrust. Lift and thrust predictions for various magnet configurations are provided. Arrangements of hover engines, which can employ the magnet configurations, and an associated guidance, navigation and control system, are described. Finally, a number of different applications, such as trains, elevators and printing, which utilize embodiments of the electromechanical systems described herein, are presented.
