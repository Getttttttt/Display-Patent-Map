abstract
    The systems and methods described herein integrate a supercritical fluid power generation system with a LNG production/NGL separation system. A heat exchanger thermally couples the supercritical fluid power generation system with the LNG production/NGL separation system. A relatively cool heat transfer medium, such as carbon dioxide, passes through the heat exchanger and cools a first portion of extracted natural gas. The relatively warm heat transfer medium returns to the supercritical fluid power generation system where a compressor and a thermal input device, such as a combustor, are used to increase the pressure and temperature of the heat transfer medium above its critical point to provide a supercritical heat transfer medium. A second portion of the extracted natural gas may be used as fuel for the thermal input device.
