abstract
    A condensate trap for a condensing boiler has a generally hollow body for receiving condensate from a heat exchanger of the condensing boiler and for providing a path of flow for condensate out of the side of the boiler. The body of the condensate trap includes a condensate receiving end having an inlet, a condensate discharging end having an outlet, and an intermediate reversely-turned trap portion interconnecting the condensate receiving and discharging ends. The hollow body can be one-piece and molded of plastic. A level sensor can be mounted on or within the condensate receiving end of the body. In a preferred embodiment, the condensate receiving end includes a chamber with an opening, and the level sensor extends within the chamber and seals the opening. The condensate trap can also include an air vent located above the level sensor in communication with an air pressure sensor.
