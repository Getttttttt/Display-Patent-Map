abstract
    The combustion gases in a used oil furnace are discharged from the combustion chamber through an opening in the upper rear portion of the combustion chamber to direct the combustion gases into an upper header. An array of vertically oriented flue tubes extends downwardly from the upper header to a lower header before being discharged through horizontally opposing discharge openings. Ventilation air is blown into the rear of the furnace past and around the vertical flue tubes and is then forced in to a laminar path extending circumferentially around the combustion chamber by an air sweep shroud spaced from the combustion chamber by an annular gap. The ventilation air is then collected in a forward discharge chamber for discharge through louvered ventilators into the adjacent ambient atmosphere.
