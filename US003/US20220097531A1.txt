abstract
    A vehicle is described that includes a multi-mode powertrain system having a first drive unit and a second drive unit. A controller is arranged to monitor the high-voltage DC power bus and is in communication with and operatively connected to first and second inverters. The controller is able to detect operation of one of the first inverter or the second inverter in an uncontrolled generating (UCG) mode, determine a driveline torque associated with the operating of the one of the first inverter or the second inverter in the UCG mode, and determine a compensating torque that is needed to counteract the driveline torque associated with the operating of the one of the first inverter or the second inverter in the UCG mode. The controller can further operate to detect a fault that may induce unintended lateral motion (ULM), and control torque outputs of the inverters based thereon.
