abstract
    A device and a method for controlling regenerative braking of an electrified vehicle includes a drive motor configured for generating power required to drive wheels, and a controller electrically connected to the drive motor, and the controller detects vehicle data when braking the vehicle, determines whether a wheel slip of the vehicle has occurred based on the vehicle data, determines a first regenerative braking amount based on a deceleration and a vehicle model when the wheel slip has not occurred, determines a second regenerative braking amount based on a maximum road surface utilization rate when the wheel slip has occurred, and controls maximum regenerative braking of the drive motor based on the first regenerative braking amount or the second regenerative braking amount.
