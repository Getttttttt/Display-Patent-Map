abstract
    A hybrid vehicle and a method for operating a hybrid vehicle are provided, the vehicle including at least a first drive unit and a second drive unit coupled to the first drive unit, wherein the second driving unit recovers kinetic energy during braking the hybrid vehicle, a transmission unit which can be coupled to the first and/or second drive unit and a drive axle. It is proposed to change the transmission ratio of the transmission unit depending on a desired amount of energy recovered by the second drive unit during regenerative braking or a predetermined time period before the anticipated start of regenerative braking.
