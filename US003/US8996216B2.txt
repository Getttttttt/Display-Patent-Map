abstract
    An electrical system of a vehicle includes at least one energy store, the vehicle having an internal combustion engine and electric machine mechanically coupled thereto, an actuatable accelerator pedal for predefining a torque to be output, an engine controller for injection of fuel, and an actuatable brake pedal, using which a controller is activated at least in a first partial range of its actuation, subject to first external operating conditions, so that recuperative power of the electric machine is generated at the same time that energy is fed into the electrical system. To increase the recuperation potential, the electric machine is switched to recuperative power by the controller in an operating phase in which a driver request is inferred due to actuations of the accelerator pedal, resulting in a braking power of the vehicle, the injection of the internal combustion engine being maintained due to second internal operating conditions.
