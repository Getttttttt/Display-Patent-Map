abstract
    A thermodynamic system and method of producing useful work includes providing a working fluid and a fluid pump, or compressor, for pumping the working fluid in a cycle. A thermal input is provided for supplying heat to the working fluid. An expansion device downstream of the thermal input converts motion of the working fluid to useful work. A heat pump is provided. A number of different means of implementing the heat pump are presented, including direct transfer of working fluid mass flow. The heat pump pumps heat from one portion of the working fluid to another portion of the working fluid. For some applications, a regenerator, or recuperator, may be used to transfer heat from a high temperature portion of the working fluid to a lower temperature portion.
