abstract
    A method for the operation of a brake system having two brake circuits, with a recuperative brake, in particular an electrical generator, a master brake cylinder and a brake pedal simultaneously achieve optimized use of the regenerative braking and a constant braking experience for the driver with the highest safety requirements. When there is a braking demand by the driver with an associated desired braking torque and a first condition is met, at least one outlet valve is opened and brake fluid is conducted with an associated volume of brake fluid into at least one reservoir and the at least one outlet valve is then closed if a second condition is met. The first condition is met if a braking variable corresponding to the braking demand is not less than a specified minimum value. The second condition is met if the volume of brake fluid has flowed into the reservoirs.
