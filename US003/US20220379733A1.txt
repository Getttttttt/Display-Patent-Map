abstract
    The disclosure relates to a method for operating a hydraulic braking system for a motor vehicle with an electrified drive train. The braking system comprises a brake booster. First, a braking request is registered and it is determined that the braking request is to be met by pure recuperative braking. In addition, an input member of the brake booster is shifted in the direction of a pressure generation unit so that it assumes an actuation position corresponding to the braking request. From here, the input member is then shifted back from the actuation position in a direction away from the pressure generation unit for hydraulic pressure relief. A control unit designed to carry out such a method is also disclosed. A braking system comprising such a control unit is also presented.
