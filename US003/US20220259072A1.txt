abstract
    Techniques are described herein for using a high-pressure reactor to separate clean water from dirty water without filtration and to extract and concentrate contaminants from dirty water for use as a fuel. In particular, techniques and systems are described for separating water from hydrocarbon contaminates, other BTU-laden compounds, and dissolved minerals, while also boiling water and condensing the resulting steam into distilled water. In addition, system in which the described techniques are performed can be used as a high-pressure pump for moving the separated hydrocarbon contaminates forward into other processes, such as a high-pressure reactor or incinerator.
