abstract
    Provided is a braking system which can enhance the power generation efficiency of a thermoelectric conversion element by efficiently recovering the heat generated during braking, or by increasing the temperature difference between a heat source and the thermoelectric conversion element. A brake pad body in a brake pad is provided with a thermoelectric conversion element. The thermoelectric conversion element includes an n-type semiconductor layer and a p-type semiconductor layer. The n-type semiconductor layer and the p-type semiconductor layer are provided in a recess formed in the back surface of the brake pad body.
