abstract
    Conveyance vehicles such as snow bikes and snowmobiles having an endless track system driven by a combustion engine are enhanced in performance with a torque assist system. The torque assist system includes an electric motor that is coupled to drive the track in parallel with the original internal combustion engine through either its own track drive, or through the drive system of the engine. The motor can be a spindle drive motor or hub motor. Torque assist is generated through a torque assist throttle input coupled to a motor controller. A battery temperature assist system diverts heated cooling fluid from the engine cooling system to heat the battery through its own heat exchanger. The controller is coupled to a processing device such as a smart phone that executes apps configured to provide parametric data to the controller and to receive parametric data from the controller through a user interface.
