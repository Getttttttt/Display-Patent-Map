abstract
    A portable food warmer and cooker includes a housing having a base, a plurality of insulated sidewalls, and a latching lid. A food tray is removably securable within the interior volume of the housing. A heating coil is disposed within the interior volume of the housing such that it surrounds the food tray. The heating coil includes an inlet connector and an outlet connector, each of which extend exteriorly through one of the sidewalls of the housing. A pair of heater hoses connect the heating coil inlet and outlet to corresponding inlet and outlet connectors of a coolant system of a motor. The liquid coolant flows through the heater hoses and the heating coil, which transfers heat to the interior volume of the food tray. The device reaches high temperatures such that it can be utilized to cook raw foods utilizing the motor coolant liquid as a heat source.
