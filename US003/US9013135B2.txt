abstract
    A power converting apparatus for electric motor vehicle propulsion is provided that is suitable for a use in which power regeneration from an inverter unit to a power storing unit or power supply from the power storing unit to the inverter unit is frequently used. The apparatus includes a converter unit that receives input of a power supply voltage from the outside, converts the power supply voltage into a direct current of a predetermined value, and outputs the direct current, the inverter unit that is connected to an output side of the converter unit and drives an electric motor, and the power storing unit that is connected to the output side of the converter unit. A converter control unit included in the converter unit generates a current command for the converter unit and controls charging and discharge currents to and from the power storing unit based on this current command.
