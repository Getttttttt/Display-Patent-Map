abstract
    A control apparatus for a motor-assisted bicycle detects a pedaling torque applied to a crankshaft with a pedaling force sensor, controls a motor unit of the motor-assisted bicycle in a regenerative control process to charge a battery if the torque value of the detected pedaling torque is equal to or smaller than a predetermined level, and controls the motor unit in an assistive control process if the torque value is greater than the predetermined level. The control apparatus includes a storage unit for storing an assisted state and a regenerated state in a single event of use of the motor-assisted bicycle by a user, and a control quantity corrector for correcting a control quantity of the assistive control process and a control quantity of the regenerative control process based on the assisted state and the regenerated state which are stored in the storage unit.
