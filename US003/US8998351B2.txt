abstract
    A brake control device for a vehicle includes: a hydraulic brake device including a master cylinder, a wheel cylinder, a differential pressure control valve, and a pump; and a differential pressure control unit that operates the pump and transmits a differential pressure instructing output to the differential pressure control valve to perform a differential pressure control such that a differential pressure is generated; wherein the differential pressure control unit includes a correcting unit, wherein the correcting unit calculates a differential pressure instructing correction amount, based on an increased amount of the differential pressure which is generated by the differential pressure control valve when the increased amount of the differential pressure during the differential pressure control and then corrects the differential pressure instructing output based on the differential pressure instructing correction amount such that the differential pressure instructing output becomes larger than the increased amount of the differential pressure.
