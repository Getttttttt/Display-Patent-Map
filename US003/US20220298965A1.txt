abstract
    The present disclosure relates to systems and methods wherein a dilute hydrocarbon stream can be oxidized to impart added energy to a power production system. The oxidation can be carried out without substantial combustion of the hydrocarbons. In this manner, dilute hydrocarbon streams that would otherwise be required to undergo costly separation processes can be efficiently utilized for improving the power production system and method. Such systems and methods particularly can utilize dilute hydrocarbon stream including a significant amount of carbon dioxide, such as may be produced in hydrocarbon recovery process, such as enhanced oil recovery or conventional hydrocarbon recovery processes.
