abstract
    Contemplated devices and methods reduce heat loss and energy demand in a ring furnace by heating an additional oxygen containing stream in a supplemental oxygen conduit that is thermally coupled to a flue duct of a cooling zone. The so heated additional oxygen containing stream is then fed to the firing and/or pre-heat zones to increases combustion of volatiles and to reduce fuel demand by recycling waste heat to the firing and/or pre-heat zones.
