abstract
    A hydraulic control method of a regenerative braking system for vehicles in which a point of time when regenerative braking torque starts to be reduced is predicted and hydraulic control is performed in advance prior to this point of time so as to improve braking performance. A hydraulic braking control unit predicts the point of time when regenerative braking torque starts to be reduced based on vehicle velocity and starts hydraulic control in advance prior to this point of time, thereby improving responsiveness of hydraulic braking force compared to the regenerative braking torque to satisfy braking force required by a driver, and minimizing a deceleration change at the end of regenerative braking to improve braking performance.
