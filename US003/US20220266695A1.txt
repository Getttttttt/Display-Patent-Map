abstract
    A system includes one or more sensors that generate sensor measurements representing a first parameter of one or more components of a power circuit. The system includes a control unit that obtains a reference rate of change value of the first parameter based at least in part on the sensor measurements over time. The control unit compares rates of change of monitored values of the sensor measurements over time to the reference rate of change value over time, and determines a deviation condition in response to the rate of change of a first monitored value of the sensor measurements differing from the reference rate of change value by more than a determined tolerance margin value. The control unit generates a control signal responsive to detecting the deviation condition to change an operating condition of at least one of the components of the power circuit.
