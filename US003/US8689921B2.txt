abstract
    A control apparatus for a motor-assisted bicycle detects a pedaling torque applied to a crankshaft with a pedaling force sensor, controls a motor unit of the motor-assisted bicycle in a regenerative control process to charge a battery if the torque value of the detected pedaling torque is equal to or smaller than a predetermined level, and controls the motor unit in an assistive control process if the torque value is greater than the predetermined level. The control apparatus switches between the assistive control process and the regenerative control process depending on the torque value which is detected, increases the predetermined level if the state of charge of the battery becomes lower than a first level, and restores the predetermined level if the state of charge of the battery becomes higher than a second level which is greater than the first level.
