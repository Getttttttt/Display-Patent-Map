abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a method for cooling an endurance braking arrangement of an electric vehicle, the vehicle comprising an electrical power storage device and the endurance braking arrangement, the vehicle comprising a cabin and a fifth wheel for connection of a trailer to the vehicle, the cabin and the fifth wheel being located at an initial distance from each other; wherein the vehicle comprises a cooling system configured to receive cooling air from a position between the cabin and the fifth wheel for cooling the endurance braking arrangement of the vehicle wherein the method comprises arranging the cabin and the fifth wheel such that an increased distance between the cabin and the fifth wheel is obtained as compared to the initial distance for increasing air flow to the cooling system.
