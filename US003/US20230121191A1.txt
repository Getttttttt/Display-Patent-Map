abstract
    The vehicle control method can include: determining a vehicle state based on a set of vehicle state inputs; determining a command based on the vehicle state; and controlling the vehicle according to the command. The method can optionally include updating a vehicle model based on a control outcome. However, the method S100 can additionally or alternatively include any other suitable elements. The method can function to determine longitudinal vehicle control based on a set of vehicle state inputs (e.g., a limited set of inputs—such as without direct knowledge of a throttle input, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, the vehicle control method can function to infer driving intent based on vehicle state measurements and/or translate inferred driving intent into low-latency vehicle control. Additionally or alternatively, the system can function to autonomously augment longitudinal propulsion, autonomously augment vehicle braking, and/or facilitate autonomous (longitudinal) vehicle control.
