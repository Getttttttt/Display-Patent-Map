abstract
    Industrial truck with an electric travel drive and controls that can switch the electric travel drive to regenerative operation to brake the industrial truck, wherein an eddy current brake is provided that can be controlled or regulated by the controls during regenerative operation to brake the industrial truck, wherein the controls control or regulate the eddy current brake depending on the rpm of the electric travel drive, and wherein the controls control or regulate the eddy current brake in a manner such that the braking torque of the travel drive is supplemented at high rpms by the braking torque generated by the eddy current brake.
