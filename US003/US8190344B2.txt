abstract
    A method of optimizing steering and stability performance of a vehicle includes measuring a set of inertial data during a regenerative braking event (RBE), calculating a set of vehicle performance data using the inertial data, and comparing the performance data to calibrated threshold data to determine a maximum regenerative braking torque (RBT). The maximum RBT is automatically applied during the active RBE. The vehicle includes a chassis, an electric motor/generator for applying an RBT, a frictional braking system, chassis inertial sensors for measuring a set of chassis inertial data, and a controller having an algorithm for calculating a set of vehicle performance data using the chassis inertial data. The controller determines the maximum RBT by comparing the vehicle performance data to corresponding threshold data. The chassis inertial sensors can include accelerometers, a yaw rate sensor, a steering rate sensor, speed sensors, and/or a braking input sensor.
