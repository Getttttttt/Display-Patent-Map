abstract
    A dehumidification system includes a compressor, a primary evaporator, a primary condenser, a secondary evaporator, a secondary condenser, a modulating valve, and a liquid-cooled alternate condenser. The secondary evaporator receives an inlet airflow and outputs a first airflow to the primary evaporator. The primary evaporator receives the first airflow and outputs a second airflow to the secondary condenser. The secondary condenser receives the second airflow and outputs a third airflow to the primary condenser. The primary condenser receives the third airflow and outputs a dehumidified airflow. The compressor receives a flow of refrigerant from the primary evaporator and provides the flow of refrigerant to the modulating valve. The modulating valve directs the flow of refrigerant to the primary condenser and to the alternate condenser. The alternate condenser receives a portion of the flow of refrigerant and transfers heat from the refrigerant to a flow of fluid.
