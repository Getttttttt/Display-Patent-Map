abstract
    A heat exchanging system suitable for use in an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) circuit comprises a split EGR heat exchanger arrangement. Exhaust gas is used to warm engine oil via a first heat exchanger during initial stages of an engine operating cycle. In the later stages of the operating cycle, recirculated exhaust gases are diverted to flow through the second heat exchanger where they are cooled by the engine coolant.
