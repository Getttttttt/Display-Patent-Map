abstract
    Systems and methods for providing opportunistic vehicle air brake system pressurization are disclosed. Vehicle air tanks used within an air brake system are pressurized during a time a battery charging status is satisfied. For example, such air tanks may be pressurized via an air compressor at a time during which the vehicle is electrically connected to a power source other than a battery of the vehicle. An example of such a power source may include an electrical charger, such as an electric vehicle charging station, or an electric generator during a regenerative braking event. The air tanks may also be pressurized by using a battery to energize the air compressor, based on the battery being charged above a predetermined threshold.
