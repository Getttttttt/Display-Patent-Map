abstract
    A hybrid electric vehicle includes a wet clutch device that establishes and interrupts a connection between an engine and an electric motor, and a transmission switchable between a driving range in which driving force can be transmitted to driving wheels and a non-driving range in which transmission of the driving force is interrupted. When a battery temperature is greater than a warm-up determination value while the vehicle is at a standstill with the transmission switched to the non-driving range, the wet clutch device is kept disengaged. When the battery temperature is less than the warm-up determination value, a battery warm-up control unit switches the wet clutch device into engaged state to connect the engine and the electric motor together and vary driving force of the electric motor alternately to a positive side and a negative side so as to repeatedly charge and discharge the battery.
