abstract
    A method for assisting a vehicle to tilt includes: receiving a first torque instruction output by a throttle assembly, and generating a second torque instruction, in which the first torque instruction is determined based on a manipulation degree applied to the throttle assembly, and the second torque instruction is determined based on attitude information of the vehicle; performing a weighted summation on the first torque instruction and the second torque instruction based on a first proportional coefficient of the first torque instruction and a second proportional coefficient of the second torque instruction to obtain a third torque instruction; and outputting the third torque instruction to a motor controller, and controlling a tilt angle of the vehicle by the motor controller based on the third torque instruction, in which the tilt angle of the vehicle is less than or equal to a target angle threshold.
