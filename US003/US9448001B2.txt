abstract
    A cooling system includes a first indirect heat exchanger configured to receive return air from an interior space and output conditioned air back into the interior space. The cooling system further includes a second indirect heat exchanger configured to receive outside air. A fluid conduit directs a flow of cooling fluid from the first indirect heat exchanger, through the second indirect heat exchanger, and back to the first indirect heat exchanger. A pump circulates the cooling fluid between the first and second indirect heat exchangers at a fluid velocity that is relatively slow. Additionally, return air and outside air flows through corresponding indirect heat exchangers at air velocities that are also relatively slow. The relatively slow fluid velocity and air velocities enhance an efficiency of heat transfer between the cooling fluid and the return air and between the cooling fluid and outside air.
