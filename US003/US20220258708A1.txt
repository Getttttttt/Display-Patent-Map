abstract
    A method for a utility vehicle, in particular a towing vehicle or a vehicle combination with a utility vehicle, includes the following steps carried out with a control unit of the utility vehicle. A status message is received from an electric drive of the utility vehicle or a trailer vehicle towed by the utility vehicle, which indicates that a braking torque can be provided via the electric drive. An offer message, which indicates an offered braking torque, is then generated depending on the status message. Furthermore, the offer message is sent out to or for at least one further control unit of the utility vehicle. The disclosure includes a braking control unit and a braking system for carrying out the method and a utility vehicle or a vehicle combination with the braking control unit or the braking system. The disclosure includes a computer program product for carrying out the method.
