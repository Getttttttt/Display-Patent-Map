abstract
    The present invention relates to a drivetrain of a motor vehicle, having an internal combustion engine, having an electric machine, having a transmission unit, in particular a manual transmission, and having a clutch unit. The clutch unit comprises a first clutch actuable by a driver of the motor vehicle and a second clutch automatically actuable by a control unit. The electric machine can be coupled in terms of drive to the transmission unit by means of the first clutch and the internal combustion engine can be coupled in terms of drive to the electric machine by means of the second clutch.
