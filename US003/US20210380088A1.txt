abstract
    An apparatus for braking a vehicle includes wheel brakes configured to generate a braking force on each of wheels, a first actuator for supplying a braking force to the wheel brakes by using a first motor and a first master cylinder, a second actuator for supplying a braking force to the wheel brakes by using a second motor and a second master cylinder, a first electronic control unit (ECU) for controlling the first actuator and determining normal or faulty operation of the first and second actuators, and a second electronic control unit (ECU) for controlling the second actuator and determining the normal or faulty operation of the first and second actuators. When the first ECU and the second ECU are determined to be normal, the first ECU controls to brake some of the wheel brakes, and the second ECU controls to brake a remainder of the wheel brakes.
