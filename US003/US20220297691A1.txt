abstract
    A method detects unintended acceleration of a motor vehicle during a closed-loop speed control mode by determining external forces on the vehicle via a controller, and then calculating a desired acceleration using a measured vehicle speed and the external forces. The method includes determining an actual acceleration of the vehicle, including filtering a speed signal as a first actual acceleration value and/or measuring a second actual acceleration value using an inertial measurement unit (IMU). During the speed control mode, the method includes calculating an acceleration delta value as a difference between the desired acceleration and the actual acceleration, and then using the acceleration delta value to detect the unintended acceleration during the speed control mode. A powertrain system for the motor vehicle, e.g., an electric vehicle, includes the controller and one or more torque generating devices coupled to road wheels of the vehicle.
