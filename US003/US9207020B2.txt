abstract
    A double flow-circuit heat exchange device for periodic positive and reverse directional pumping having at least two bi-directional fluid pumps. The bi-directional fluid pumps produce positive pressure or negative pressure at fluid ports on two sides of the bi-directional heat exchange device to periodically pump the fluid in positive and reverse flowing directions. During operation of the periodically positive and reverse pumping, the directional flow of the fluid in first and second flow fluid circuits are maintained in different flowing directions.
