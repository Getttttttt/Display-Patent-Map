abstract
    If the temperature (Tig) of a switching element (25) in a source power supply circuit (24) of an electric motor (2) increases to be equal to or greater than a first predetermined value (α) while an electric vehicle (1) is in a stall state, a torque command for the electric motor (2) is reduced while a braking force command for a brake unit (10) is increased, and if the temperature (Tig) of the switching element (25) subsequently decreases to be equal to or less than a second predetermined value (β(<α)), the braking force command for the brake unit (10) is decreased while the torque command for the electric motor (2) is increased. The increment rate of the torque command for the electric motor (2) is varied in accordance with the degree of road gradient.
