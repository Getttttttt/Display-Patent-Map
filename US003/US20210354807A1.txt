abstract
    A ground power system for supplying electrical power to an aircraft and method of using the same is disclosed in which an electric motor is connected to an aircraft wheel to drive the aircraft wheel, an autonomous vehicle battery carrier is releasably connected to the aircraft through an articulating robotic arm to power the electric motor and to move the aircraft on the ground to support aircraft taxiing and preparation for takeoff using the battery power from the autonomous vehicle, and a command system releases the autonomous vehicle battery carrier as roll begins but before the aircraft rotates.
