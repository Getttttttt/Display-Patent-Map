abstract
    Methods, systems, and devices provided in accordance with various embodiments are generally related to the field of thermal management systems for buildings (or volumes in general), such as cold storage, food processing, or other buildings that have areas that are kept below freezing. Embodiments generally pertain to the management of temperature and humidity within these spaces. Some embodiments include system for the management of moisture and temperature inside cold spaces. Some embodiments include a heat and mass transfer exchanger, such as a direct constant gas liquid heat and mass transfer exchanger. Examples of such heat and mass transfer exchangers generally include wet scrubbers. Embodiments also generally include a series of ducts, pipes, heat exchangers, dampers, and/or valves that may allow the system to provide useful temperature and relative humidity levels to one or more spaces or volumes.
