abstract
    A control device for a vehicle is provided, which includes a power source that generates torque for driving or braking the vehicle, an accelerator pedal sensor that detects an operating amount of an accelerator pedal, and a control unit that controls the power source. The control unit sets a target acceleration based on the accelerator pedal operating amount detected by the accelerator pedal sensor. The control unit sets a target jerk based on the target acceleration, and when the target acceleration decreases toward 0 from a value above 0, sets the target jerk so that an absolute value of the target jerk becomes smaller as the target acceleration approaches 0. The control unit sets torque to be outputted or regenerated by the power source, based on the target acceleration and the target jerk.
