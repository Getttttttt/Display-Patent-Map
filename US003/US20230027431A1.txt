abstract
    An electric vehicle control device, an electric vehicle control method, and an electric vehicle control system according to one embodiment of the present invention are configured to: obtain, based on operation information on release of an accelerator pedal of a vehicle and turn information on a turn of the vehicle, change rate information on a temporal change amount of a regenerative braking force with respect to an operation amount of the accelerator pedal; and output a regenerative braking control command for applying the regenerative braking force to a wheel based on the change rate information.
