abstract
    Disclosed is an electrohydraulic brake system for use in vehicles which can be braked by means of generator operation of an electric drive motor. The brake system comprises, inter alia, a brake booster and an electronic control unit which is provided for distributing the braking effect between a generative component or recuperation braking component and a friction braking component. In order to optimize the take-up of pressure medium, in particular during recuperation braking, the brake booster (6, 11, 15) is configured to be electrically actuated by the electronic control unit (10). The boosting force generated by the brake booster (6, 11, 15) is exerted as a function of variables relevant to the brake system.
