abstract
    The invention concerns a process for operating a fired furnace which is heated using a fuel gas stream and forming a combustion product stream, wherein heat of at least part of the combustion product stream is used in forming a steam stream. It is provided that at least a part of the steam stream is subjected to a high-temperature electrolysis to form a hydrogen-containing and an oxygen-containing material stream, and that at least a part of the hydrogen-containing material stream is used as the fuel gas stream. A corresponding arrangement is also the subject of the invention.
