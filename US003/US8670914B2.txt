abstract
    A vehicle brake control system has a braking detector and a braking controller. The braking detector determines whether a braking operation in a vehicle is within an initial braking stage based on a control condition of a frictional braking system. The braking controller performs initial braking stage control during the initial braking stage by controlling a regenerative braking system to provide a limited braking torque and the frictional braking system to provide a supplemental braking torque, the combination of which provides a target braking torque. The braking controller performs subsequent braking control when the initial braking stage ends to provide an increased regenerative braking torque and a lower supplemental braking torque as the target braking torque.
