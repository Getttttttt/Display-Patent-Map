abstract
    A brake interface circuit for use with a hybrid drive system includes a brake interface circuit for selectively enabling and disabling the operation of a brake that is actuated by an actuator. The brake interface circuit includes a brake cylinder and an actuator control valve that is adapted to selectively enable and disable the operation of the brake by the actuator. First and second control valves are connected between the brake cylinder and the actuator control valve. The brake interface circuit is operable in a first operating mode to cause the actuator control valve to enable the operation of the brake by the actuator, a second operating mode to cause the actuator control valve to disable operation of the brake by the actuator, and a third operating mode to cause the actuator control valve to enable the operation of the brake by the actuator even though a portion of the brake interface circuit is operated in the second operating mode.
