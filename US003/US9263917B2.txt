abstract
    A non-contact power receiving apparatus includes a power reception unit for receiving electric power in a non-contact manner from a power transmitting apparatus external to a vehicle, and a control device for controlling the transmitted power from the power transmitting apparatus. The control device controls the transmitted power based on a monitoring result obtained by monitoring the surroundings of the vehicle, and an occupant detection result obtained by detecting whether or not an occupant enters the vehicle. When the monitoring result indicates the approach of a moving object to the vehicle, the control device causes the power transmitting apparatus to reduce the transmitted power. The power transmitting apparatus and the power reception unit transmit and receive electric power in a non-contact manner by electromagnetic field resonance.
