abstract
    In a vehicle that generates creep torque using an electric motor, a controlling means that causes, on the basis of the results of the detecting by the vehicle speed detecting means and the braking operation detecting means, the electric motor to generate the creep torque, wherein if the brake is operated when the creep torque is generated, the controlling means decreases the creep torque by a first level, if the brake is not operated when the creep torque is generated, the controlling means increases or decrease the creep torque in a level range on the basis of the speed of the vehicle detected by the vehicle speed detecting means, and the first level is a decreasing level larger than a possible maximum decreasing level in the level range.
