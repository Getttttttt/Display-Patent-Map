abstract
    A driving force control device for a hybrid vehicle includes: a travel load calculation unit adapted to divide a predicted route from a current position to a predetermined distance ahead into a plurality of intervals, and to estimate a travel load in each interval; a recommended discharge amount calculation unit adapted to search for a regeneration possible interval, in which a travel condition required by a driver can be maintained even when an output of an internal combustion engine is stopped and regeneration is performed by a motor/generator, from an estimation result, and to estimate a charge amount expected value in the regeneration possible interval, and distributes the charge amount expected value preferentially to an adjacent interval to the regeneration possible interval as a recommended discharge amount in order to stop the output of the internal combustion engine; and an energy management unit that controls an operation of the motor/generator in the current position on the basis of a travel condition, a state of charge, and the recommended discharge amount in the current position.
