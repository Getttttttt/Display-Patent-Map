abstract
    Methods and systems are provided for controlling engine oil dilution in automotive vehicles. The method comprises heating coolant by operating an exhaust gas heat recovery device and circulating the heated coolant via a first coolant loop between the exhaust gas heat recovery device and a heat exchanger; and heating coolant by operating an exhaust gas recirculation cooler and circulating the heated coolant via a second coolant loop between the exhaust gas recirculation cooler and the heat exchanger, wherein the heated coolant from both the exhaust gas heat recovery device and the exhaust gas recirculation cooler mix at the heat exchanger and allows heating of an engine oil via the heat exchanger. In one example, the method prevents excessive accumulation of water and/or fuel in the engine oil.
