abstract
    A vehicle control device configured to control a driving motor coupled to a wheel of a vehicle includes a motor controller and a driving mode determiner. The motor controller is configured to control the driving motor so that the driving motor enters a regenerative state while the vehicle is coasting and stops accelerating. The driving mode determiner is configured to determine whether the vehicle is in a first or second driving mode. In the first driving mode, a driving operation strength is low and the vehicle behavior is slow and gentle. In the second driving mode, the driving operation strength is high and the vehicle behavior is quick and active. When the vehicle stops accelerating in the second driving mode, the motor controller is configured to make a regenerative torque of the driving motor smaller than when the vehicle stops accelerating in the first driving mode.
