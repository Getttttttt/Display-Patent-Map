abstract
    A ventilation apparatus including a housing having an inlet flow path to discharge outdoor air, to an indoor space through a first outlet, and an outlet flow path to discharge indoor air, to an outdoor space through a second outlet, a total enthalpy heat exchanger in which air flowing along the inlet flow path and air flowing along the outlet flow path exchange heat, and a heat exchanger to remove moisture in the air flowing along the inlet flow path. The housing including a connection flow path connecting the inlet flow path to the outlet flow path, and a connection path opening and closing unit configured to selectively open and close the connection flow path. The connection flow path to allow indoor air, to pass through the heat exchanger and flow to the first outlet while preventing the indoor air from flowing to the total enthalpy heat exchanger.
