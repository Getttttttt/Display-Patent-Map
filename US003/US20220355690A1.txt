abstract
    A fire fighting vehicle includes an energy storage system coupled to the chassis and a charging assembly configured to interface with a charging plug. The energy storage system includes battery cells. The charging assembly includes a housing, a charging port disposed within the housing and electrically coupled to the battery cells, a retainer positioned proximate the charging port, a first actuator, and a second actuator. The charging port is configured to engage with a charging interface of the charging plug. The retainer is configured to engage with a retaining interface of the charging plug to secure the charging interface within the charging port. The first actuator is positioned to release the retaining interface from engagement with the retainer by repositioning the retaining interface into a release position. The second actuator is positioned to eject the charging plug from the charging assembly when the retaining interface is in the release position.
