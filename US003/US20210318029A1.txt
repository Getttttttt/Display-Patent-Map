abstract
    Aspects of the invention are directed to condensate traps having a back portion and a front portion. The back portion includes a first passage enclosed between the first wall, a second wall, and a back wall. A first opening in the back portion connects the first wall and the second wall with a first float placed over the first opening and does not travel below the first opening and is prevented from leaving the first passage by a first constriction. The front portion of the condensate trap includes a second passage enclosed between the third wall and the fourth wall. A second opening connects the third wall and the fourth wall in the front portion and a second float is placed below the second opening such that it does not travel through the second opening and is prevented from falling below a predetermined level by a second constriction.
