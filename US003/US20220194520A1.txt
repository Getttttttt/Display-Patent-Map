abstract
    The present invention discloses a chainless electrical bicycle, which is designed to eliminate any type of mechanical means to transfer torque and power from pedals to a traction wheel. The present invention employs a generator to transfer a pedal torque and power with the help of power electronics, control electronics, a battery and control methods to a motor that is used for traction, which is attached to the traction wheel. The generator power is supplemented with the battery power, wherein the battery is rechargeable. The main purpose of the present invention is to emulate a mechanical chain bicycle operation, eliminate shortcomings of a mechanical chain bicycle, and introduce convenience features, such as, but not limited to, continuously variable electronic gear, a gravity compensation, a static and dynamic torque assistance, a ride charge feature, and an electric brake system.
