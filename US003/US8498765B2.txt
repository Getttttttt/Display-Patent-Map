abstract
    A control device configured with a first control portion controls an engagement pressure of a first engagement device to make a rotational speed of the input member equal to a predetermined rotational speed during the specific electric power generation control. A second control portion controls an engagement pressure of the second engagement device in such a manner as to make a transfer torque capacity of the second engagement device equal to a predetermined transfer torque capacity during the specific electric power generation control. Another control portion determines a target rotational speed in such a manner as to maintain a state in which an electric power generation amount achieved by the rotating electrical machine coincides with a predetermined target electric power generation amount, in accordance with a magnitude of a differential torque as a difference between a torque transmitted via the first engagement device.
