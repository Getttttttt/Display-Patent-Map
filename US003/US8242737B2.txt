abstract
    In a motor-driven vehicle using power stored in a secondary battery as a source of motive power in which part of vehicle braking is achieved by regenerative braking by generating electrical energy absorbed by charging the secondary battery, the state of charge of the secondary battery is adjusted during charging so that, when charging is completed, the state of charge of the battery will be such that it is still capable of receiving energy generated during regenerative braking. During charging, after the battery has been charged to a target charge level, and battery temperature has subsequently changed, a state where the battery is still capable of receiving energy generated during regenerative braking can be achieved by slightly discharging the battery depending on the temperature of the battery. Such slight discharge of the battery can be obtained by powering an electric heater (22) in an engine cooling water circuit or operating a generator (7) as a motor for motoring the vehicle engine (8).
