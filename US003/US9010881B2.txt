abstract
    An electronic control unit inputs from temperature sensors a temperature of the heating side of a thermoelectric conversion section assembled to each of brake units provided for left and right rear wheels. When the temperature of the heating side is equal to or lower than a predetermined temperature, the electronic control unit drives and controls a brake hydraulic pressure control section so as to operate the brake units preferentially over brake units provided for left and right front wheels. With this operation, each of the brake units generates friction heat, and heats the heating side of the corresponding thermoelectric conversion section, whereby the thermoelectric conversion section efficiently collects thermal energy and generates electrical power. Meanwhile, when the heating side temperature is higher than the predetermined temperature, the electronic control unit drives and controls the brake hydraulic pressure control section so as to decrease the proportion of the braking forces applied by the brake units and increase the proportion of the braking forces applied by the brake units.
