abstract
    Disclosed is a method of controlling regenerative braking of a hybrid vehicle, and a device thereof. The method includes: controlling, by a controller, a hybrid vehicle to start a braking operation in response to a brake pedal operation signal; and after the braking operation of the hybrid vehicle is started, controlling, by the controller, a second motor that is connected to an input shaft of a transmission of the hybrid vehicle to perform regenerative braking.
