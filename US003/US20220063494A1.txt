abstract
    This invention concerns a sound and performance emulator (1) for an electric propulsion vehicle (100) with a first sensor (2) to emit a clutch signal (2 a) relative to the position of a clutch (101) of the electric propulsion vehicle (100); a second sensor (3) to emit a gear signal (3 a) relative to the position of a gear-switch (102) of the electric propulsion vehicle (100); a control unit (4) which receives an acceleration signal (5) relating to an accelerator position (103) of the electric propulsion vehicle (100); a vehicle speed signal (6) and/or an engine revolutions signal (7) relating to the engine revolutions (RpmExt) of the electric motor (104); the clutch signal (2 a); and the gear signal (3 a). The control unit (4) calculates a simulated engine revolutions value (RpmFinal) and a simulated gear inserted value (GearInserted) of a simulated endothermic combustion vehicle. The control unit (4) provides a requested simulated torque value and/or an output throttle signal (OutputThrottle) to be sent to the electric propulsion vehicle (100) to control it.
