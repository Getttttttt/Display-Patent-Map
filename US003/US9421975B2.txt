abstract
    A vehicle control apparatus includes a battery, a boost converter connected to the battery for boosting battery voltage, an inverter connected to the boost converter for performing DC to AC conversion, and a motor-generator connected to the inverter for outputting drive power. Then, if an inter-vehicle distance is less than or equal to a predetermined distance or a relative speed in approaching direction is greater than or equal to a predetermined speed, the output voltage of the boost converter is lowered. This suppresses the output of the motor-generator and controls the inter-vehicle distance.
