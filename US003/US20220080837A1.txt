abstract
    A vehicle includes driven wheels, an actuator operably coupled to the driven wheels by a drivetrain, and a braking system having friction brakes associated with the driven wheels. A controller is programmed to, in response to the vehicle being in a drift mode, decouple the driven wheels from the actuator, engage the friction brakes to lockup the driven wheels, and place the actuator in speed control and command a torque to the actuator based on a difference between a measured speed of the actuator and a target speed of the actuator.
