abstract
    Provided is a drive control device for a standby four-wheel drive vehicle having primary drive wheels coupled to a drive source including a motor generator that generates a regenerative braking torque and a clutch device disposed between the drive source and secondary drive wheels to switch a two-wheel drive state using the primary drive wheels and a four-wheel drive state using the primary drive wheels and the secondary drive wheels, including: a transmission torque control portion that causes the clutch device to set a transmission torque between the drive source and the secondary drive wheels to zero so as to allow only the primary drive wheels to perform regenerative braking if a request braking torque of the vehicle is equal to or lower than a predetermined primary-drive-wheel regeneration limit torque during the regenerative braking by the motor generator, the transmission torque control portion causing the clutch device to generate the transmission torque between the drive source and the secondary drive wheels so as to allow the primary drive wheels and the secondary drive wheels to perform the regenerative braking if the request braking torque exceeds the primary-drive-wheel regeneration limit torque.
