abstract
    A method for controlling a vehicle includes monitoring the vehicle speed for a first threshold in conjunction with a driver request for negative torque, after which the method comprises increasing a friction braking ratio. The method further comprises monitoring the speed of the vehicle for a second threshold, wherein the second threshold is lower than the first, after which the method comprises solely using the friction braking for braking holding torque.
