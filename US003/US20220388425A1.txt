abstract
    Power management system for battery-operated vehicle including electric motor, and kinetic energy devices for capturing kinetic friction energy produced by moving parts in the vehicle. A central direct current (DC) supercharge component (CDCSC) converts kinetic friction energy into an electric current. The CDCSC connects to a current toggle that directs electric current to battery packs i.e., a first battery pack and second battery pack for powering the electric motor. The current toggle directs electric current to battery packs to recharge/store power. The power management system governs power output from the battery packs, manages depletion/efficiency of the battery packs. The power management system includes a parallel port that directs outgoing power feeds from the battery packs to the electric motor. The electric motor connects to a drive shaft of the vehicle. The power management system includes an additional battery pack that stores excess kinetic friction energy captured for external transfer.
