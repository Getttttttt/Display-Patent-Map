abstract
    If the accelerator is on upon restarting a driving force source in travel mode by the time when the vehicle comes to a standstill after the driving force source is manually operated to stop while the vehicle is traveling, a control device for the vehicle implements first control in which the driving force output to the drive wheels is gradually increased. If the accelerator is on upon switching to the travel mode following restarting of the driving force source in the neutral mode and by the time the vehicle comes to a standstill after the driving force source is manually operated to stop while the vehicle is traveling, the control device implements second control in which the driving force output to the drive wheels is increased. The first control increases the driving force not as much as the second control increases the driving force.
