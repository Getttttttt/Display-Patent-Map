abstract
    A system for operating an electric or hybrid-electric vehicle includes a computer programmed to identify a location of a vehicle, access a map and identify a plurality of links therein, pre-screen the plurality of links to identify if any of the plurality of links is within a given bounds of the current location, and if one or more possible links are identified, then match the current location of the vehicle to one of the identified links, and upload power data for the vehicle corresponding to the matched location into a database.
