abstract
    A regenerative braking apparatus has an inverter. The inverter uses the rotational energy of the wheels to let the motor generator generate electric power for the purpose of providing regenerative braking. The regenerative braking apparatus also includes a refrigeration cycle unit and a heating cycle unit. The refrigeration cycle unit compresses a refrigerant with the electric power of the battery in order to heat a heat exchanger. The heating cycle unit is a unit in which a medium heated by the heat exchanger flows to heat the battery. When the battery is in a fully charged state where the battery cannot be charged with regenerative electric power of the motor generator, the regenerative braking apparatus exercises electric power consumption control to force the refrigeration cycle unit and the heating cycle unit to consume the electric power of the battery.
