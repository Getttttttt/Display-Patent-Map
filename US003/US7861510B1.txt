abstract
    A high temperature heat exchanger for use with a small gas turbine engine to produce a combined cycle power plant, where the heat exchanger includes ceramic heat exchange tubes of SiC that are tightly fitted to the heat exchanger so that no welds or brazing is used and prevent any thermal stresses between the tubes and the heat exchanger end plates or baffle plates. The heat exchanger includes an inner casing and an outer casing with the heat exchange tubes extending through the heat exchanger between the two casings, and the gas turbine engine operating in the space within the inner casing. The tubes are tightly fitted in holes within the end plates and baffle plates, and a molybdenum disulfide coating is used to form a seal.
