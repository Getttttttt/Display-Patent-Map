abstract
    A braking system is configured to perform one or more of cooperative braking or a combination of regenerative braking and hydraulic braking. The system includes a master cylinder, a reaction disc made of an elastic material and configured to compress the master cylinder, a rod assembly including an operating rod, an elastomer fixing unit, and an elastomer whose one end abuts a part of the operating rod and the other end abuts the elastomer fixing unit, an electric booster including a motor piston configured to compress a part of the reaction disc, for compressing the master cylinder by adjusting a displacement of the motor piston, and an electric controller configured to control the electric booster and perform control to brake the vehicle by using one or more of the regenerative braking and the hydraulic braking.
