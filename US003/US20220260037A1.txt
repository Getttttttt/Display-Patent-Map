abstract
    Methods and apparatus for power generation and/or thermal management on a high speed flight vehicle include circulating a power generation loop working fluid through a power generation loop, which absorbs heat associated with the flight vehicle. A generator operably coupled to the power generation loop generates electrical power. Additionally, a heat transport loop working fluid may circulate through a heat transport loop to provide thermal management through heat transfer.
