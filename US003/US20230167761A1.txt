abstract
    An injection structure using integrated exhaust heat recovery system (EHRS) condensate, the structure including an integrated heat exchange part connected to an engine of a vehicle and branched from an exhaust outlet of an exhaust manifold to integrate exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and EHRS, a condensate circuit part extended from a rear end of the integrated heat exchange part to the engine of the vehicle and configured to move exhaust gas condensate, a three-phase valve configured to open and close so that a low-temperature coolant is selectively introduced into the integrated heat exchange part according to operating conditions, an EGR valve configured to open and close so that EGR gas with filtered condensate flows into the engine of the vehicle, a bypass valve fluidly connected to an exhaust muffler, and a controller configured to control opening and closing of the three-phase valve, the EGR valve, and the bypass valve according to the operating conditions.
