abstract
    A control device for a vehicle includes: a plurality of controllers, each of which executes a plurality of energy saving control modes for restricting reduction of driving energy of the vehicle; a selector for displaying the plurality of energy saving control modes at the same time and for prompting an user of the vehicle to select execution or rejection of one of the plurality of energy saving control modes; and a central control device for controlling one of the plurality of controllers to execute a corresponding energy saving control mode, of which the execution is selected by the user, so that a maximum cruising range of the vehicle is expanded without providing a feeling of discomfort.
