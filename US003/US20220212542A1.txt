abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric machine and a controller. The controller is programmed to, in response to releasing an accelerator pedal during a first driving scenario that is based on a first set of navigation data, increase regenerative braking torque of the electric machine to a first value. The controller is further programmed to, in response to releasing the accelerator pedal during a second driving scenario that is based on a second set of navigation data, increase the regenerative braking torque of the electric machine to a second value that is less than the first value.
