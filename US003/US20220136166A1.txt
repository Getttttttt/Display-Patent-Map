abstract
    A heat exchange exhaust system for a clothes dryer, comprising an inner exhaust air conduit, an outer air supply conduit concentric with and external to the inner exhaust air conduit; a plurality of radial fins for maintaining a volume between the inner exhaust conduit and the external supply conduit; sealing means for sealing the back perimeter of the clothes dryer to an adjacent wall; and an air supply plenum within the adjacent wall from which the inner exhaust air conduit and outer air supply conduit connect to an external building wall. All incoming supply air may be drawn from the exterior and all exhaust air may be exhausted to the exterior. The supply air and exhaust air are physically separated. Heat energy in the exhaust air is transferred from the outgoing exhaust air to the incoming air supply to preheat the incoming air supply and cool the exhaust air.
