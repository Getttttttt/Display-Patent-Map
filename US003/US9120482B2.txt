abstract
    A control device for a vehicle drive configured with a power transfer path that includes a first engagement device, a rotary electric machine, and a second engagement device. These elements being arranged in this order from an input member coupled to an engine to an output member that is coupled to the wheels of the vehicle. The control device is configured with an control section that controls output torque of the rotary electric machine such that a rotational speed becomes closer to a target rotational speed with both the first and second engagement devices brought into a slip engagement state and with the rotary electric machine generating electric power. The control section maintains control in which at least one of a temperature of the rotary electric machine and a temperature of an inverter is monitored as a monitoring target temperature.
