abstract
    A combined power generation system is provided. The combined power generation system includes a gas turbine configured to combust fuel to generate a rotational force, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) configured to heat feedwater using combustion gas discharged from the gas turbine and include a high-pressure section, a medium-pressure section, and a low-pressure section with different pressure levels, a fuel preheater configured to heat the fuel supplied to the gas turbine and include a primary heating part and a secondary heating part, and a high-pressure feedwater supply pipe connected to the high-pressure section to supply high-pressure feedwater to the secondary heating part.
