abstract
    A method for controlling regenerative braking of an automobile micro-hybrid system is disclosed. The system includes at least a rotary electrical machine and an electrochemical battery. The method includes a step, when the electrochemical battery has a first predetermined energy state, which corresponds to an initial optimum charging state, of commanding a reduction of the first energy state, to a second energy state corresponding to an intermediate charging state, so as to make a charging capacity available in the electrochemical battery during a subsequent opportunity for recovery of electrical energy during, for example, a braking phase of the vehicle.
