abstract
    The present invention relates to a braking system for a vehicle at least partially propelled by an electric traction motor, the braking system comprising an electric machine electrically connected to an electric source; an air flow producing unit mechanically connected to, and operated by, the electric machine; and an electrical brake resistor arrangement positioned in fluid communication between the air flow producing unit and an ambient environment, the electrical brake resistor arrangement being electrically connected to the electric source and arranged to heat air supplied from the air flow producing unit by electrical power received from the electric source, and to supply heated air to the ambient environment.
