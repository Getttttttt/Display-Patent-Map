abstract
    A ventilation system including a ventilator and a processor. The ventilator includes a housing, first intake, second intake, first outlet, second outlet, dampers, first air blower, second air blower, total heat exchanger, and heat exchanger. The processor is configured to change the air flow path of air flowing through the housing from an intake flow path and discharge flow path while in a ventilation mode to a heat exchanger cleaning mode or a total heat exchanger drying mode, in which air in the room flows into the housing through the first outlet, passes through the heat exchanger and then the total heat exchanger, and is discharged to the space outside the room through the second outlet.
