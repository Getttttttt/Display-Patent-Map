abstract
    A system includes a source of regenerative power that generates power during a regenerative event, an electrical energy storage system connected with the source of regenerative power to receive and store regenerative power during the regenerative event, an accessory load that reduces an amount of energy stored in the energy storage system when being powered, a source of information, and an accessory load controller. The accessory load controller is responsive to the source of information to estimate when a next occurrence of a regeneration event will occur, predict whether the energy storage device will be in a state of charge condition to receive regenerative power at the time of the predicted regeneration event, and control an application of electrical power to the accessory load based on the prediction in order to reduce the amount of energy stored in the energy storage device and minimize any loss of regenerative power during a next regenerative event.
