abstract
    An electric vehicle is provided that can include a first generator configured to generate electric power when the electric vehicle is moving at or above a first speed and a second generator configured to generate electric power when the electric vehicle is moving below the first speed or standing at a stop. The electric vehicle can include a main electric motor that is configured to receive electric power from the first generator when the electric vehicle is moving at or above the first speed and from the second generator when the electric vehicle is moving below the first speed. The electric vehicle can also comprise an auxiliary electric motor in communication with the second generator, wherein, activation of the auxiliary electric motor causes the second generator to generate electric power. The electric vehicle can further comprise one or more batteries configured to supply electric power to the auxiliary electric motor.
