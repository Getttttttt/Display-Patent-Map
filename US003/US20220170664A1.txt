abstract
    The present application provides a heat exchange device. The heat exchange device includes: a case, an interior of which is formed into an air-supply inflow space, an exhaust inflow space, an air-supply outflow space and an exhaust outflow space separated from each other, wherein a first extension wall is provided between the air-supply inflow space and the exhaust outflow space; and a heat exchange unit disposed in the case, and the air-supply inflow space and the air-supply outflow space communicate with each other by the heat exchange unit to form an air-supply air path, and the exhaust inflow space and the exhaust outflow space communicate with each other by the heat exchange unit to form an exhaust air path, wherein the air-supply air path and the exhaust air path exchange heat when passing through the heat exchange unit; the first extension wall is provided with a circulation air port communicating the air-supply inflow space and the exhaust outflow space, wherein the circulation air port may be selectively opened and closed. The heat exchange device may not only provide indoor air circulation but also ensure heat exchange efficiency.
