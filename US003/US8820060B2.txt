abstract
    According to the present disclosure, a train comprising one or more locomotives coupled to one or more tenders, which contain at least one of an exhaust after-treatment or a waste heat recovery system and optionally one or more other locomotive subsystems, such as dynamic braking, energy storage, driven wheels, and fuel storage, is provided. Accordingly, the present disclosure may have one or more of the following advantages: a tender to house an exhaust after-treatment system thereby easing space constraints on the locomotive power traction car. Additionally, said tender may include a large fuel tank, waste heat recovery system, and energy storage, thereby providing the means to substantially decrease fuel consumption or increase power, both with the option of switching to a different fuel source.
