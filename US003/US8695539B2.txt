abstract
    A water heater includes combustion means (burner) that combusts fuel and generates exhaust; heat exchange means (primary heat exchanger and secondary heat exchanger) that exchanges heat of the exhaust for supplied water; bypassing means (bypass pipe) that makes the supplied water flow to an outlet of the heat exchange means; exchanged heat temperature detection means (exchanged heat temperature sensor) that detects temperature of the supplied water after heat exchange; flow rate adjustment means (bypass valve) that adjusts a volume of the supplied water flowing into the bypassing means and the heat exchange means; and a control unit that controls the flow rate adjustment means so as to make a predetermined volume of the supplied water or over flow to the heat exchange means.
