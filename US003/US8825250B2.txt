abstract
    Systems and methods are provided for detecting that an electric motor drive vehicle (e.g., an electric scooter or motorbike) is idling based on one or more of sensed parameters indicative of the idling state. These sensed parameters may include one or more of, alone or in any combination, a sensed throttle position, at least one sensed electrical characteristic of a traction electric motor, a power converter, or an electrical storage device of the vehicle, and a sensed rate of rotation of a drive shaft of the traction electric motor or of a wheel drivably coupled to the traction electric motor. Upon detecting that the vehicle is in an idling state, a controller of the vehicle enters into a standby mode. In the standby mode, a relatively small amount of electrical power is supplied to the traction electric motor to cause a vibration of the motor to alert a driver that the vehicle is ON in the standby mode and is ready to be driven. Additionally, an audible and/or visual indication may be issued in the standby mode to further alert the driver that the vehicle is ON and ready to be driven.
