abstract
    A fast HRSG starting method and apparatus for combined cycles requiring frequent cycling, baseload and backup power; preventing grid failure from variables of wind and solar power. A once-through HRSG, eliminating all except two hot thick wall components: the high pressure superheater and reheater headers. The method fills the high pressure superheater with boilerwater; whereby steam is generated in starting as thick header's and tube's ramp-up together at saturation temperatures as the gas turbine attains synchronous speed No-Load; reducing conventional thermal stress failures loss of availability and costly repairs. At gas turbine full power dry steam is generated by the high pressure superheater at low allowable temperature start and load the steam turbine and protect the reheater. The dryout zone in the high pressure superheater is controlled loading the steam turbine faster than conventional without problematic attemperators, thereby decreasing: thermal stresses, fuel, emissions and possible ingestion of spray-water.
