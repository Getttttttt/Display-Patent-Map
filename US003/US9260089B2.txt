abstract
    The invention relates to a method for controlling a deceleration arrangement (10) of a motor vehicle with at least one regenerative braking device (12) which is designed to decelerate the motor vehicle by means of a variable braking torque and to generate electrical energy corresponding to the braking torque. A return speed of an operating element for driving the motor vehicle, in particular an accelerator pedal (22), is detected (S2). A predefined braking torque is exerted (S5) by the regenerative braking device (12) if the return speed and/or a variable correlating thereto exceed(s) or fall(s) below a predefined threshold value.
