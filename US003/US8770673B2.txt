abstract
    In a brake device for a motor vehicle having a first and a second hydraulic brake circuit, the second brake circuit is decoupled from the main brake cylinder in partial braking operations, and is operated with the aid of a pressure accumulator controlled by a control device, which takes an additional deceleration effect due to an active power component, e.g., a generator, into account.
