abstract
    A hybrid electric automotive powertrain includes an electric machine operable in propulsive and regenerative modes. The machine has positive and negative torque limits for the propulsive and regenerative modes, respectively, to reduce potential thermal damage to the machine due to overheating. The negative and positive torque limits are reduced independently as a temperature of the machine increases. The negative torque limit may be reduced at a greater rate than the positive torque limit.
