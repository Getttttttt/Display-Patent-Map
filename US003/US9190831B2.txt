abstract
    A power supply system has a power storage device and an ECU, and supplies driving electric power to a load device. The power storage device includes an interrupting device configured to interrupt a conduction path of the power storage device. The load device includes a voltage sensor for detecting a voltage applied to the load device, and supply of electric power from the load device to the power storage device is stopped in response to a failure of the voltage sensor. Where the voltage sensor has failed, the ECU determines presence or absence of activation of the interrupting device, based on a variation length of an actual current that is input to or output from the power storage device and a variation length of a command current set in accordance with requested electric power requested based on a user's operation.
