abstract
    A desiccant air conditioner has a high energy efficiency due to the absence of excessive heat loss due to ventilation. In order to meet this requirement, the desiccant air conditioner is equipped with a honeycomb rotor wash-coated with agents having capabilities of absorptions of humidity, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and this honeycomb rotor is divided into at least an absorption zone and a desorption zone. The air in a room is, after being passed through the absorption zone, fed back to the room, and the air which is passed through the desorption zone is exhausted into outside of the room. In this way, carbon dioxide and nitrogen in a room, the latter quantity being corresponded to that of the consumed oxygen in the room, are exhausted into outside of the room, allowing to exhaust carbon dioxide and at the same time to keep the oxygen density to within an allowed limit without the need of excessive ventilation.
