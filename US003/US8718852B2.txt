abstract
    A self-learning regenerative braking control module is adapted for use with a vehicle, and includes a driving mode determining unit, an analyzing unit, and a regenerative braking determining unit. The driving mode determining unit determines a driving mode according to an accelerator signal, a brake signal, and a speed signal from the vehicle and outputs a coasting duration and coasting information associated with the driving mode to the analyzing unit for obtaining acceleration information. The regenerative braking determining unit obtains target regenerative braking data containing target vehicle speeds that vary with time based upon the acceleration information and regenerative braking reference data stored therein.
