abstract
    A multi-mode hybrid transmission for transmitting power from a prime mover and a stored source of energy to a final drive shaft. The transmission may include an input shaft to receive torque from the prime mover, a countershaft operatively coupled to the final drive shaft, a plurality of gear pairs each defining a torque path from the input shaft to the countershaft, a synchromesh clutch assembly to selectively couple the input shaft with a desired gear pair, and first and second electric machines rotatably carried by the input shaft. The first electric machine can provide a motive force to the final drive shaft and the second electric machine can covert rotary speed of the input shaft into electrical energy. Additionally, the first and second electric machines can provide supplemental torque to the output shaft during periods of reduced torque from the prime mover associated with a change in torque path.
