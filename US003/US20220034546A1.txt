abstract
    An air mixing system for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system includes a conduit configured to receive a first airflow and a second airflow and to discharge the first airflow and the second airflow as a mixed airflow via an outlet of the conduit. The air mixing system also includes a thermal wheel disposed within the conduit. The thermal wheel is configured to direct the first airflow and the second airflow thereacross, rotate within the conduit, and transfer heat between the first airflow and the second airflow.
