abstract
    Braking of a vehicle and a trailer can be balanced when regenerative braking of the vehicle is activated. The activation of regenerative braking of the vehicle can be detected. Responsive to detecting that regenerative braking of the vehicle is activated, one or more brakes of the trailer can be caused to be activated. Thus, the braking effectiveness of the vehicle and the braking effectiveness of the trailer can be substantially balanced. As a result, a possible push force from a trailer to the vehicle towing the trailer can be reduced, which, in turn, can help to avoid unwanted movements of the trailer (e.g., swaying or jackknifing).
