abstract
    A system in an electric vehicle converts the mechanical energy resulting from movement of the vehicle chassis to electric energy. The system has one or more energy conversion units including an alternator with a rotatable shaft and a weighted fly wheel fixed to the shaft. A female receptor on an end of the alternator shaft is disposed in spaced, axial alignment with a male driver on the end of a spiral ratcheting shaft that is operatively engaged with a pivoting lever and the chassis of the vehicle, whereupon upward and downward motion of the chassis frame causes the male driver to move between engagement and disengagement with the female receptor. A ratchet mechanism drives rotation of the spiral ratcheting shaft upon engagement of the male driver with the female receptor, thereby rotating the female receptor, flywheel and alternator shaft. The male driver disengages from the female receptor, allowing the fly wheel and alternator shaft to freely rotate in order to generate electric energy which is used to continuously charge a bank of batteries for powering the electric vehicle.
