abstract
    An electrical component control system is provided for controlling a plurality of electrical components that can be installed on an electric bicycle in which human-powered driving is assisted by a motor. The bicycle electrical component control system basically includes a control part that sets a current operation mode from at least three operation modes based on an operating state of each of the electrical bicycle components. The control part controls the electrical bicycle components in accordance with the current operation mode that was selected.
