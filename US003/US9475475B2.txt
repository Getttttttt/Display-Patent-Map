abstract
    A hydraulic brake system includes: a plurality of hydraulic brakes; and a first hydraulic pressure generator including a first hydraulic pressure source and a first hydraulic pressure controlling portion that is configured to control an output hydraulic pressure of the first hydraulic pressure source to a target hydraulic pressure. The plurality of hydraulic brakes includes (a) at least one disk brake and (b) at least one drum brake. The first hydraulic pressure generator is in communication with a first brake cylinder that is the brake cylinder of each of the at least one disk brake, and is isolated from a second brake cylinder that is the brake cylinder of each of the at least one drum brake, in a case when a regenerative cooperative control is executed.
