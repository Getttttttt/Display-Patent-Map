abstract
    The present invention provides a complex power generation facility including a first transfer unit that transfers liquefied natural gas; a first heat exchange apparatus that causes the liquefied natural gas supplied from the first transfer unit to exchange heat with seawater, vaporizes the liquefied natural gas into natural gas, heats the seawater into hot water, and discharges the hot water; a second heat exchange apparatus that selectively receives the hot water discharged from the first heat exchange apparatus and caused the natural gas passing through the first heat exchange apparatus to exchange heat with seawater and hot water; and a power generation unit that generates power as the natural gas supplied from the second heat exchange apparatus passes therethrough.
