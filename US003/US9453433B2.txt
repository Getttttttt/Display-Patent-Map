abstract
    Embodiments of a system that configured as a closed loop system, with a pump, an evaporator, a power generator, and a condenser, the combination of which circulate a working fluid to generate electrical power. The embodiments can harvest residual energy in the working fluid to improve efficiency and to reduce power loss that can derive from the pump as well as other auxiliary loads (e.g., fans). In one embodiment, the system incorporates members that operate in response to the working fluid, often in the higher pressure vapor form that occurs after evaporation and/or power generation stages. These members can include mechanical elements, for example, that have motive action (e.g., reciprocate, rotate, etc.) that is useful to satisfy operating and power requirements of auxiliary loads. For the pressurization stage, these mechanical elements may embody a piston-and-cylinder arrangement (or other rotary or linear positive displacement arrangement) that generates motion that can drive the pump.
