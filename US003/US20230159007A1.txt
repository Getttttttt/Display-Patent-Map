abstract
    Provided is a high-pressure thermal fluid brake and engine energy recovery system, comprising a plurality of energy collection systems (1) and energy storage systems (2) which are connected to one another, and a control unit (19) connected to the energy collection systems (1) and the energy storage systems (2); the control unit (19) is connected to a vehicle controller, and at east reads and acquires the accelerator pedal position information, brake pedal position information, vehicle travel parameters, and cooling system parameters of a vehicle; the energy collection systems (1) recover vehicle's kinetic energy, engine's mechanical energy and engine's thermal energy, and stores the recovered energy into the energy storage systems (2), and the control unit (19) controls, according to the vehicle information read and acquired, the energy recovery and release of the energy collection systems (1) and the energy storage systems (2). The present invention can effectively recover and reuse vehicle's braking energy, engine's idle energy and engine's thermal energy, reduce the energy waste of a motor vehicle system, and achieve the purposes of energy saving, oil sav ing and emission reduction.
