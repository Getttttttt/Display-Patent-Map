abstract
    An electronic bicycle includes a torque control system that controls what torque is applied to wheels of the electronic bicycle by electronic hub motors. The torque control system may determine a torque to apply to the wheels based on user input signals. The torque control system also may detect when the wheels of the electronic bicycle are slipping, and adjust the torque to minimize the time that the wheel is slipping. Additionally, the torque control system may determine a coefficient of friction between the wheels and the ground and determine a maximum torque to apply to the wheels based on the coefficient of friction. Furthermore, when braking, the torque control system may determine whether torque is applied to the wheels by passive braking or by active braking.
