abstract
    A device and method determines available regenerative braking energy in a route for a target vehicle. The device is in communication with a navigation unit and is configured to split the at least one route between a source and a destination into multiple segments followed by determining vehicular data of the target vehicle. The device determines available/recoverable regenerative braking energy in the at least one route for the target vehicle based on selective vehicular data of other vehicles similar to the target vehicle, which have travelled through the at least one route. The device is configured to dynamically predict the available regenerative braking energy originating from random longitudinal deceleration maneuvers for the chosen route from source location to the chosen destination location for any hybrid or electric vehicle. The device improves fuel efficiency and reduces emissions.
