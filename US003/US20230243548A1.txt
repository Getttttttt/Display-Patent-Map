abstract
    A ventilator comprising a housing, a first flowpath extending from a first inlet to a first outlet and a second flowpath extending from a second inlet to a second outlet, wherein the housing comprises a partition defining a first chamber and a second chamber therein, and wherein the first flowpath extends through both the first and second chamber and the second flowpath extends through at least one of the first chamber or second chamber; a first movable damper disposed in the first flowpath and configured to apportion an amount of a first fluid flowing therein between the first chamber and the second chamber; and a first recovery core comprising a plurality of first passageways and a plurality of second passageways disposed in the first chamber such that the plurality of first passageways fluidly communication with the first flowpath and the plurality of second passageways fluidly communication with the second flowpath.
