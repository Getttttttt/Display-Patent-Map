abstract
    A method of operating a gas turbine power plant with a first gas turbine group, including a first turbine assembly, and a second gas turbine group, including a compressor assembly and a second turbine assembly which are mechanically coupled to one another, and useful work is extracted by a device being included in the plant, where a flue gas stream is produced by a combustion device, which is placed in a gas flow stream upstream of the second turbine assembly, where the second turbine assembly and compressor assembly are balanced to each other such that work produced by the second turbine assembly is consumed by the compressor assembly, and where the first turbine assembly is balanced to the device for the extraction of useful work such that work produced by the first turbine assembly is consumed by the device for the extraction of useful work.
