abstract
    An air conditioner unit includes a housing defining an outdoor portion and an indoor portion. A makeup air intake duct and a makeup air exhaust duct are disposed above the housing. The air conditioner unit also includes an air to air heat exchanger. The air to air heat exchanger includes a first inlet side attached to the makeup air intake duct, a second inlet side, a first outlet side, and a second outlet side attached to the makeup air exhaust duct. The air to air heat exchanger also includes one or more alternating top layers and bottom layers. The one or more top layers are in fluid communication with the first inlet side and the first outlet side, and the one or more bottom layers are in fluid communication with the second inlet side and the second outlet side.
