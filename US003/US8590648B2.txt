abstract
    A hybrid drive train for a vehicle has an internal combustion engine, first and second electric machines and a transmission that are mechanically connected to one another to drive at least one axle of the vehicle. The internal combustion engine (1) and the first electric machine (2) are provided on an input shaft of the transmission (3), and the second electric machine (4) is provided on an output shaft (6) of the transmission or on an axle of the vehicle. The maximum power and/or the maximum torque of the internal combustion engine are/is substantially larger than the power or torque that can be transmitted by the transmission.
