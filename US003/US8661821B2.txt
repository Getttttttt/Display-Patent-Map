abstract
    The present invention relates to a process for reducing coal consumption in coal fired plant with fluidized-bed drying, namely a fluidized-bed drying system is provided between a coal powder bunker as well as a weighing belt and a coal grinding mill of the prior coal fired boiler generating set, and superheated steam which has done partial work is extracted from an steam turbine and used as a drying medium, moisture contained in the coal powder is evaporated with sensible heat and latent heat of the superheated steam, water resulted from the condensation of the superheated steam is fed into a deaerator of the steam turbine via a condensate pump for recirculation. The present invention has advantages of reducing coal consumption and saving coal, recovering residual heat, reducing emission of carbon dioxide and adopting to the national industrial policy on energy saving and emission reduction.
