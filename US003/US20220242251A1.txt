abstract
    A vehicle control apparatus controls a traveling motor coupled to wheels. The vehicle control apparatus includes a torque setting unit and a motor control unit. The torque setting unit sets a first target torque and a second target torque as target torques of the traveling motor. The first target torque changes based on an accelerator operation performed by a vehicle' s driver. The second target torque changes more gradually than the first target torque. The motor control unit controls the traveling motor based on the first target torque or the second target torque. When the vehicle is moved forward without the accelerator operation, the torque setting unit sets the first target torque and the second target torque to a regenerative side. When the vehicle having been stopped is moved forward without the accelerator operation, the motor control unit controls the traveling motor based on the first target torque.
