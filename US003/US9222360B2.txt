abstract
    A combined heat and power plant has at least one primary heat source thermally connected to a heat distribution network for heat energy via one or more primary heat exchangers. At least one secondary heat source is thermally connected to one or more energy converters arranged to, when an amount of heat energy is supplied from the at least one secondary heat source, generate an amount of electrical energy for an internal electricity distribution network in the combined heat and power plant. A method is for operating a combined heat and power plant.
