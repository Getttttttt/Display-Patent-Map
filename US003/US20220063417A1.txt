abstract
    A braking control method of an electrified vehicle provided with an electric motor as a driving source may include the steps of starting regenerative braking when a required braking amount is obtained; determining a minimum transition time which is a minimum time required for braking transition from the regenerative braking to hydraulic braking according to a maximum response slope of a hydraulic braking device of the vehicle; determining braking deceleration according to the required braking amount and a road surface condition; determining a start vehicle speed of the braking transition according to the minimum transition time, the braking deceleration, and an end vehicle speed of the braking transition; and starting the braking transition upon determining that the start vehicle speed of the braking transition is reached during the regenerative braking.
