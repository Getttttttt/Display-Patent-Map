abstract
    An electric vehicle may include a battery, a drive axle, a drive wheel coupled to the drive axle, and a combined motor and brake unit. The combined motor and brake unit may be electrically coupled to the battery and mechanically coupled to the drive axle. The combined motor and brake unit may include a housing, an electric motor inside the housing and electrically coupled to the battery, a transmission inside the housing, a motor output shaft, a braking mechanism, and a motor input shaft. The transmission may transmit rotation of the electric motor to the drive axle and the drive wheel. The motor output shaft may couple the electric motor to the transmission. The braking mechanism may be coupled to the housing. The motor input shaft may couple the electric motor to the braking mechanism and input, to the electric motor, a braking force applied by the braking mechanism.
