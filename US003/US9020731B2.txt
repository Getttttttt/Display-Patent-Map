abstract
    A PI calculation unit of a rectangular-wave voltage control unit calculates a control deviation by performing a PI calculation on a torque deviation relative to a torque command value, and outputs a voltage phase of a rectangular-wave voltage in accordance with the control deviation. A rate-of-change limiter imposes a restriction on the rate of change of the voltage phase. Here, the rate-of-change limiter lessens the restriction on the rate of change of the voltage phase, when the rate of change of the rotational speed of an electric motor is larger than a predetermined value representing an abrupt change of the rotational speed of the electric motor.
