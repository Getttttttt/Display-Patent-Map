abstract
    An embodiment method of controlling traveling of an electrified vehicle equipped with an electric motor as a power source includes determining whether it is possible to enter a variable control function. The variable control function includes a function of variably controlling a coasting torque level using a regenerative braking force. In response to a determination that it is not possible to enter the variable control function, a cause of an inability to enter the variable control function is determined and control is performed in a manner that corresponds to a determination that it is possible to enter the variable control function or the determination of the cause of the inability to enter the variable control function in response to the determination that it is not possible to enter the variable control function.
