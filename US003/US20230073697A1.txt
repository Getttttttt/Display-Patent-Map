abstract
    A one-way clutch regenerative braking system includes a sleeve which is arranged on an outer circumference of a hub and moved in an axial direction, a clutch gear which is arranged on a side of the hub and meshed with the sleeve, and a one-way clutch which is arranged on an inner circumference of the hub and rotated in a first direction, wherein, when the sleeve and the clutch gear are meshed with each other, the clutch gear is rotated in a second direction which is opposite to a rotational direction of the one-way clutch.
