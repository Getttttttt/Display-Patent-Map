abstract
    The present invention provides an integrated system of moisture removal, air purification, and air ventilation of the process air while some of the energy and resources required for operation of the system are self-sustained, or in some aspects the present system is self-regenerated such as heating and cooling of air and water exchanged among various elements/modules/members within the system or between the system and the surroundings, such that it becomes an all-time and all-round air dehumidifier, purifier and ventilator. Related method for removing air moisture from the surroundings using the present system is also provided.
