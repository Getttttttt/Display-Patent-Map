abstract
    The present disclosure provides a graded oxygen regulating, explosion preventing and recycling system and method for liquid nitrogen wash tail gas, and relates to the technical field of environmental protection and energy utilization. The system provided by the present disclosure includes a multi section catalytic combustor, the multi-section catalytic combustor being divided into a first-section catalytic combustion region, a second-section catalytic combustion region, and a third-section catalytic combustion region, the first-section catalytic combustion region and the second-section catalytic combustion region being internally filled with multiple layers of catalysts that are disposed at intervals, and an air flow guide pipe being arranged above each layer of catalyst; a first-section heat exchanger communicating with the first-section catalytic combustion region; a second-section heat exchanger communicating with the second-section catalytic combustion region; a pulverized coal drying section communicating with the second-section heat exchanger; and a boiler section communicating with the third-section catalytic combustion region.
