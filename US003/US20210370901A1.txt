abstract
    A brake apparatus using an electric booster may include: an electric booster connected to a master cylinder and configured to pressure a push rod by pressurizing a reaction disk using an electromotive force of a motor with a pedal stepping force of a driver who steps on a brake pedal, and pressurize a piston of the master cylinder through the push rod; and a control unit configured to compare required brake pressure by the pedal stepping force of the driver and current brake pressure by the motor control to set pressure, and perform cooperation control through an ESC (Electronic Stability Control) and cooperation control through the electric booster.
