abstract
    A self-excited eddy current liquid-cooled retarder is disclosed. The retarder pertains to an auxiliary braking device retarding a vehicle, and comprises a retarder rotor, a retarder stator, a control module and a generator unit. The retarder rotor comprises a retarder coil, an electromagnet core and a core cage. The retarder coil is wound on a coil frame. The electromagnet core is inserted into the coil frame. The electromagnet core, the retarder coil and the coil frame are evenly distributed on the circumference of the core cage. The retarder rotor is connected to a transmission shaft of an automobile. The inner circle of the retarder stator and the outer circle of the electromagnet core of the retarder rotor are coaxial. The generator unit comprises a generator exciting winding, a generator exciting magnetic pole, a generator armature winding and a generator armature core and is received in the retarder rotor.
