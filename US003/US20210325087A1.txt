abstract
    The disclosed technology includes a system and method of preventing short cycling in a water heater. The system can include a burner, a temperature sensor, and a controller. The controller can be configured to perform several steps to determine whether to turn on a burner and whether to increment a temperature offset value based on the amount of time that has elapsed since the last time the burner was on.
