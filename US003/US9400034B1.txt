abstract
    A product may include a differential unit that may be engaged with first and second axle shafts that may be driven from a common gear. An electrical machine may be positioned on a first side of the differential unit. A first shaft may extend from the electrical machine and into the differential unit. A power transfer unit may be positioned on a second side of the differential unit opposite the first side. A second shaft may extend into each of the differential unit and the power transfer unit. The first and second shafts may be rotationally engageable through the power transfer unit.
