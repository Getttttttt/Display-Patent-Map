abstract
    Method of fabricating structures, such as parts for use in nuclear power generation systems, are described herein. A representative method of fabricating a part for a nuclear reactor system includes additively manufacturing the part as a monolithic structure from a wire formed of an oxide dispersion strengthen (ODS) material, which includes an oxide material dispersed within a metal material. Specifically, the method can include directing a beam of thermal energy toward the wire to melt the wire, and permitting the melted wire to cool and solidify to form the part such that the oxide material remains substantially dispersed within the metal material. By maintaining the dispersion of the oxide material within the metal material, the ODS material can retain a good creep resistance, wear-resistance, corrosion resistance, and/or other ODS material property at elevated temperaturesâ€”even after fabrication.
