abstract
    A waste heat recovery system for use with an engine. The waste heat recovery system receives heat input from both an exhaust gas recovery system and exhaust gas streams. The system includes a first loop and a second loop. The first loop is configured to receive heat from both the exhaust gas recovery system and the exhaust system as necessary. The second loop receives heat from the first loop and the exhaust gas recovery system. The second loop converts the heat energy into electrical energy through the use of a turbine.
