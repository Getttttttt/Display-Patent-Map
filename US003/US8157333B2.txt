abstract
    A braking device includes: an input member configured to interlock with a displacement of a brake pedal; an output member which is movable relatively to and independently of the input member and is configured to generate a fluid pressure in a master cylinder; a braking mechanism configured to exert a braking force on a wheel by the fluid pressure generated in the master cylinder; drive means configured to drive the output member independently of the input member; and a clutch mechanism which is provided between the input member and the output member and configured to engage the input member with the output member so as to allow the input and output members to uniformly move when the output member is not driven by the drive means, and to cancel the engagement between the input member and the output member when the output member is driven by the drive means.
