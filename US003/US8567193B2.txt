abstract
    The present invention provides a waste heat recovering device capable of recovering waste heat with good efficiency from various heat sources in an internal combustion engine. The waste heat recovering device for driving an expander 14 by evaporating a working fluid by waste heat of an internal combustion engine 11 includes: a working fluid circulation flow path 15 in which the working fluid of the expander 14 is caused to circulate; a high-temperature heat exchanger 12 for heating the working fluid flowing in the working fluid circulation flow path 15 by a high-temperature fluid such as exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine 11; a low-temperature heat exchanger group 16 having, for each of low-temperature fluids such as cooling water and oil of the internal combustion engine 11, a low-temperature heat exchanger 13 a,  13 b for heating the working fluid flowing in the working fluid circulation flow path 15 by any one of the low-temperature fluids, the low-temperature heat exchangers 13 a,  13 b being disposed in parallel with each other; a flow rate control valve 17 that controls a flow rate of the working fluid flowing into each low-temperature heat exchanger 13 a,  13 b of the low-temperature heat exchanger group 16; and control means 18 for controlling the flow rate control valve 17.
