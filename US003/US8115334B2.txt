abstract
    A system and method for operating power take-off (PTO) systems aboard hybrid and electric systems and vehicles is disclosed. The PTO system includes an energy storage device configured to supply electrical power and at least one electrical drive system electrically connected to the energy storage device to receive the electrical power, with each of the at least one electrical drive systems configured to convert the electrical power to a desired mechanical power. The PTO system also includes at least one PTO shaft mechanically connected to each of the at least one electrical drive systems that is driven by the mechanical power to generate a mechanical output, with the mechanical output of each of the at least one PTO shafts being independently controllable from the mechanical output of other PTO shafts.
