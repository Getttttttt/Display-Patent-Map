abstract
    A charging connector includes a lock button for locking the charging connector in a charging inlet, and a limit switch for electrically connecting a control pilot line and a ground line to each other in response to an operation of the lock button. The vehicle inlet includes a switch circuit for selectively connecting the control pilot line and the ground line with a resistance circuit, depending on whether a charging lid is open or closed. A CPU is configured to be able to supply a voltage to the control pilot line, and based on a potential of a control signal in accordance with presence/absence of voltage supply to the control pilot line, it detects the state of connection of a charging cable and the state of control pilot line.
