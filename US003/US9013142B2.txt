abstract
    A vehicle and a power source are connected to each other at the time of charging by a charging cable including a signal line for transmitting a pilot signal for communication of information and a power line for transmitting electric power. The pilot signal has voltage changeable between a high level and a low level having a lower potential than the high level. The charging connector is provided with a power terminal to be supplied with the electric power from the power line, a signal terminal receiving the pilot signal transmitted from the signal line, and a light emitting diode having one end coupled to a signal of the signal line and the other end coupled to a node of a higher potential than the low level, with the forward direction thereof from the other end to the one end.
