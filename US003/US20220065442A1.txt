abstract
    A process for producing steam for use in a hydrocarbon recovery process includes introducing feed water into a steam generator to produce the steam and a blowdown stream, contacting the blowdown stream from the steam generator with a flue gas including carbon dioxide from the steam generator to absorb at least a portion of the carbon dioxide from the flue gas, and directing the blowdown stream including the portion of the carbon dioxide absorbed from the flue gas, into a disposal well.
