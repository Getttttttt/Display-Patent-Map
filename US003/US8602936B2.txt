abstract
    An automobile driving system includes an engine and a transmission. The transmission includes a variable gear ratio mechanism and a gear ratio of the transmission can be set to infinity. A one-way clutch is provided at an output portion of the transmission. At a time of a engine stopping controller controlling to stop the engine, a transmission-and-control device uses inertia from the engine up to an input member of the one-way clutch as assisting force for driving operations of the variable gear ratio mechanism to change the gear ratio at the transmission to infinity or close to infinity, before the engine actually stops.
