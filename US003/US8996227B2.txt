abstract
    A power control system for controlling a power network of a hybrid electrical vehicle, is provided. The power control system includes a power generating unit, one or more energy storage units coupled to a power converting unit, an electrical load. The power control system further includes a control logic module for controlling the power generating unit and the power converting unit. The control logic module is configured to identify a power demand from the electrical load and to select the power generating unit or one of the one or more energy storage units to control a voltage level of the power network based on the identified power demand, based on electrical characteristics of the power generating unit, of the power converting unit, and of the electrical load, and based on a current mode of operation of the vehicle.
