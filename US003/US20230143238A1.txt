abstract
    The present invention provides a vehicle control device capable of improving fuel consumption while reducing deterioration of emission by appropriately controlling a powertrain system of a vehicle. A vehicle control device includes: a prediction unit configured to predict speeds or accelerations of a vehicle based on a plurality of prediction models; a fuel consumption information calculation unit configured to calculate fuel consumption for each of a plurality of prediction results obtained by the prediction unit; a selection unit configured to select any one of the plurality of prediction results; and a powertrain control unit configured to control at least one of an engine, a generator, an inverter, a drive motor, and a transmission of the vehicle based on the prediction result selected by the selection unit.
