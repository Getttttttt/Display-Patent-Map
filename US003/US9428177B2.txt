abstract
    A vehicle includes an electric storage apparatus that outputs an electric power to be converted into a kinetic energy for use in running of the vehicle, an engine that generates a kinetic energy for use in running of the vehicle, a generator that receives an output from the engine to generate an electric power, and a controller that controls charge and discharge of the electric storage apparatus. In performing charge of the electric storage apparatus using an electric power from an external power source and in performing charge of the electric storage apparatus using the electric power output from the generator in response to a signal produced through operation by a user, the controller calculate a full charge capacity of the electric storage apparatus based on an SOC of the electric storage apparatus at each of start and end of the charge and a current sum amount during the charge.
