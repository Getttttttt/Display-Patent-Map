abstract
    An electrified vehicle includes a motor connected to wheels and configured to perform regenerative braking at the wheels, a battery configured to store regenerative electric power output by the motor through the regenerative braking, and a controller configured to control the regenerative braking such that a braking torque applied to the wheels is less than or equal to a maximum braking torque and the regenerative electric power output by the motor is lower than or equal to a maximum regenerative electric power. The controller is configured to be able to change the maximum regenerative electric power and, when the controller has changed the maximum regenerative electric power, change the maximum braking torque.
