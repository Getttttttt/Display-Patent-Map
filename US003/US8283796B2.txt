abstract
    A hybrid engine installation (200) includes drive element (204) suitable for driving a mechanical element (BTP, BTA) in rotation. In addition, the hybrid engine installation is remarkable in that it includes at least one gas turbine (253, 254) and at least one electric motor (201) mechanically linked to the drive element (204) to drive it in rotation.
