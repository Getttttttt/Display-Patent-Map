abstract
    An electric vehicle includes: an electric motor; a wheel that is driven by the electric motor; a power transmission mechanism that defines at least a part of a power transmission path between the electric motor and the wheel and that transmits rotational power of the electric motor to the wheel; a wheel brake that is provided on the wheel; an electromagnetic brake that stops rotation of the electric motor; and a controller that maintains a control value of a rotation speed of the electric motor at 0 and activates the electromagnetic brake when a vehicle speed becomes lower than or equal to a predetermined value close to 0.
