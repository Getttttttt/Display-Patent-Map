abstract
    Vehicle brake system comprises a hydraulic brake device, a regenerative brake device to drive wheels driven by a generator-motor and a brake control device for cooperatively controlling the hydraulic brake force and the regenerative brake force in response to an operation amount of a brake operation member. This vehicle brake system further includes a differential amount calculating portion calculating a differential amount by subtracting a regeneration execution brake force obtained by execution of the generator-motor from a regeneration request brake force, a regenerative range judging portion for judging whether the regeneration request brake force is within a range of a re-generable brake force which is executable by the generator-motor and a hydraulic pressure restricting portion for restricting increase of the hydraulic brake force when the differential amount is a positive value and the regeneration request brake force is within the range of the re-generable brake force.
