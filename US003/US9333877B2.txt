abstract
    A method of controlling a creep torque of a vehicle includes: determining whether the vehicle is in a creep driving state based on an accelerator pedal position value; determining whether a vehicle speed is greater than a set vehicle speed; determining at a first time whether a deceleration condition is satisfied when the vehicle speed is greater than the set vehicle speed; when the deceleration condition is satisfied at the first time, storing a first time at which the deceleration condition is satisfied and determining whether a deceleration release condition is satisfied; when it is determined that the deceleration release condition is satisfied, determining at a second time whether the deceleration condition is satisfied; and when it is determined that the deceleration condition is satisfied at the second time, storing the second time at which the deceleration condition is satisfied.
