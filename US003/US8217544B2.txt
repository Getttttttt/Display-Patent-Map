abstract
    A motor-generator has a stator including an annular stator core and stator windings wound on the stator core, an annular inner rotor located radially inward of the stator core, and an annular outer rotor located radially outward of the stator core. Each of the inner and outer rotors is made of a soft magnetic material or magnetic steel. The stator core consists of a plurality of stator core segments each being in the form of a tooth. The stator windings are wound on the stator core in a continuous distributed winding manner at a predetermined winding pitch. The outer rotor consists of a plurality of outer rotor segments each of which is magnetically polarized to have opposite polarities on opposite circumferential ends thereof. Each of the outer rotor segments is offset from the inner rotor by a predetermined electrical angle that corresponds to the winding pitch of the stator windings.
