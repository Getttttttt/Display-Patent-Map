abstract
    A piston and a reciprocating expansion engine with a piston having a piston head, a piston neck, and a piston shaft are described. The piston head has at least one groove which runs in a circumferential direction suitable for receiving a piston ring, and the piston shaft has a pin boss and, at its outer circumference, a guide surface which is suitable for guiding the piston along a cylinder inner wall. An outer diameter of the piston neck is smaller than an outer diameter of the piston head and/or of the piston shaft, and the length of the piston neck approximately corresponds to the travel of the piston in the installed state.
