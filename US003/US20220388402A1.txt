abstract
    An automobile brake control method, a device, and an automobile. The method includes performing a real time monitoring for failure on an automobile brake system in real time; obtaining automobile working condition information when the automobile brake system is in a failure state; generating a failure determination result according to the automobile working condition information in the failure state; generating a reverse-dragging brake instruction corresponding to reverse-dragging brake condition and sending it to a motor controller, enabling the motor controller to perform the reverse-dragging brake according to the reverse-dragging brake instruction when determining the automobile working condition information after the failure of the brake system satisfies the reverse-dragging brake condition corresponding to the failure determination result. The method can control the motor to perform reverse-dragging brake when the brake system fails or the performance is reduced to a certain extent, so as to effectively improve the safety of the automobile.
