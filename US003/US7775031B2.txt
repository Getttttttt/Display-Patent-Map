abstract
    A recuperator for use in transferring heat from gas turbine exhaust gases to compressed air inlet gases before combustion. The recuperator utilizes a plurality (e.g., thousands) of microtubes or microchannels to form a heat exchanger having high effectiveness and low pressure drop while maintaining a low weight. Accordingly, the recuperator presented herein may be incorporated into light aircraft and helicopters without significantly compromising the performance thereof.
