abstract
    Offgas containing carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide that is produced in the reduction of ores and other metal oxides in a reactor is treated to reduce its carbon dioxide content and is then contacted with metal oxide to reduce the oxidation state of the metal and oxidize carbon monoxide therein to carbon dioxide, following which the reduced metal is oxidized with steam to produce hydrogen that can be fed to the reactor.
