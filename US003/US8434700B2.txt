abstract
    Methods and systems for a feed injector are provided. The feed injector system includes a plurality of annular channels that are substantially concentric about a longitudinal axis. The plurality of annular channels direct a flow of fluid substantially axially therethrough from a respective source to a reaction zone. The feed injector system also includes a swirl member extending into the fluid flow path defined in at least one of the plurality of annular channels wherein the swirl member is configured to impart a circumferential flow direction to fluid flowing through the at least one annular channel.
