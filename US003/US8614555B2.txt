abstract
    An actuator control system includes a controller and a buck-boost circuit. The controller is configured to direct power from a power source to an actuator. The actuator is coupled to a control device to apply a force related to operation of a vehicle. The buck-boost circuit is configured to direct excess power generated by the actuator to an energy storage device when an actuator power level satisfies an anticipated power level.
