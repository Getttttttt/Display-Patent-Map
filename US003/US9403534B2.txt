abstract
    In a method for operating a hybrid drive device of a motor vehicle, which has at least two different drive assemblies, especially an electric machine and an internal combustion engine, that are able to be connected to at least two drive trains of the motor vehicle, during the reconnecting of one of the drive assemblies, particularly from a first to a second of the drive trains, or from the second to the first drive train, and/or during a synchronization, a replacement torque substantially corresponding to the torque produced by the one drive assembly is able to be provided by an additional one of the drive assemblies by the at least partial closing of a clutch.
