abstract
    A method is provided for controlling regenerative braking for a vehicle having a propulsion system, a motor, a transmission, and a clutch selectively coupling the motor to the transmission. The method includes estimating a future time at which the clutch disengages from the transmission. A rotational speed at which the clutch disengages from the transmission is calculated based on an idle speed of the propulsion system. A difference between a speed of the motor and the clutch disengage speed is monitored. A ramp down of regenerative torque on the motor is initiated when the difference is below a predetermined value and before the future clutch disengage time elapses.
