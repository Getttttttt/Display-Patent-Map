abstract
    A humidity control device includes a condenser and a water absorber-drainer. The condenser has a first region and a second region. The first region is a region having hydrophilicity and where moisture is condensed. The condensed moisture is moved by gravity to the water absorber-drainer via the second region. The water absorber-drainer includes a temperature control member and has a water absorption surface and a water drainage surface. When a temperature of the water absorber-drainer is in a first temperature region, the water absorber-drainer absorbs through the water absorption surface the moisture moved from the condenser. When the temperature of the water absorber-drainer is controlled to be in a second temperature region by an operation of the temperature control member, the water absorber-drainer drains the absorbed moisture through the water drainage surface.
