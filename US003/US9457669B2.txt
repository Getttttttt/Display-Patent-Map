abstract
    A brake control device mounted to a vehicle that comprises a pair of driving wheels and a pair of non-driving wheels controls an upstream brake pressure generated by a master cylinder and downstream brake pressures generated by brake actuators so that, during regenerative braking, the downstream brake pressures to brake devices corresponding to the driving wheels are reduced to be lower than the upstream brake pressure, and the downstream brake pressures to brake devices corresponding to the non-driving wheels are increased to be higher than the upstream brake pressure.
