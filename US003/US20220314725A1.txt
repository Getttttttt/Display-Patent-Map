abstract
    A control device controls a vehicle including a seat suspension which is provided between a chassis and a seat of the vehicle and restricts vibration and of which each of a spring constant and a damping coefficient is changeable and controllable. The control device detects, as vehicle information, a vehicle speed, an acceleration, a state of acceleration operation by a driver, a state of deceleration operation by the driver, and a state of steering by the driver. The control device determines, based on the vehicle information, whether the driver has driving preference of emphasizing the steering stability performance of the vehicle or driving preference of emphasizing the ride comfort performance of the vehicle, and, according to the determined driving preference, changes an acceleration of the seat by controlling the seat suspension.
