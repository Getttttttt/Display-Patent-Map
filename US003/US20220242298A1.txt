abstract
    A liftgate assembly, such as a for a delivery vehicle, includes a liftgate that is movable by hydraulic power between a raised position and a lowered position. The hydraulic power unit includes an energy-recovery mechanism that stores energy while the liftgate is being lowered under load. Energy stored by the energy-recovery mechanism, such as in an accumulator, may be used to raise the liftgate. The hydraulic power unit includes a pump that pumps hydraulic fluid for providing hydraulic pressure. The liftgate assembly thereby uses energy more efficiently, enabling repurposing part of the energy from lowering the liftgate (and any cargo thereupon) in raising the liftgate.
