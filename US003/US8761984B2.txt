abstract
    A kinetic energy recovery system (“KERS system”) and motorcycle equipped with the same is disclosed. The KERS system may be mechanical, hydraulic, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, motorcycle includes a rear wheel, an electric motor, a motor shaft, and a front wheel equipped with a wheel hub that includes a sprag clutch. The motor shaft can be fitted with a motor drive sprocket that drives a jackshaft chain that in turn drives a jackshaft input sprocket that is fitted to the jackshaft. Jackshaft input sprocket may be installed in conjunction with a sprag clutch that allows the rear wheel to free wheel during coasting while the front wheel KERS system is engaged. The motor harvests kinetic energy from the front wheel without simultaneously powering the rear wheel while the use of a geared dead zone allows the front and rear wheels to not lock together to improve safety.
