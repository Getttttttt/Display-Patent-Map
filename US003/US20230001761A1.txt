abstract
    an apparatus for controlling energy of a fuel cell vehicle, which may expand a usable range of an energy consuming device, may increase efficiency of heating and cooling, and may simplify a layout of the device. The apparatus includes a stack cooling line having a first coolant heated by a fuel cell stack and cooled by a first heat exchanger; a resistor cooling line having a second coolant heated by a braking resistor and cooled by a second heat exchanger; and a third heat exchanger configured to exchange heat between the first coolant of the stack cooling line and the second coolant of the resistor cooling line.
