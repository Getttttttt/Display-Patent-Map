abstract
    Method and systems for one-pedal driving (OPD) control for a vehicle. The methods and systems determine that regenerative braking is to be applied based on accelerator pedal stroke data, predict an upcoming deceleration event based on sensor data from a sensor system of the vehicle, thereby providing deceleration prediction data, adjust a default braking profile based on the deceleration prediction data, generate a regenerative braking command based on the accelerator pedal stroke data and the adjusted braking profile, and output the regenerative braking command to a motor/generator of the vehicle.
