abstract
    A kiln system is provided, including a drying section, a preheating section, a firing section, a soaking section, a cooling section, and a decarburization section arranged between the drying section and the preheating section. The decarburization section includes an ignition zone, a hot air combustion/pyrolysis zone, and a waste heat recovery pipeline. A heat source is introduced into the ignition zone so that the temperature of the ceramsite of the raw materials with heating values in the zone is 400° C. to 900° C. The hot air combustion/pyrolysis zone is configured for combusting or pyrolyzing carbon-containing materials and organic components in the raw materials with heating values in the ceramsite. The waste heat recovery pipeline is configured for discharging decarburization exhaust gas and recovering heat released after the raw materials with heating values in the ceramsite are combusted or pyrolyzed in the decarburization exhaust gas.
