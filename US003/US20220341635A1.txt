abstract
    A transducing method comprising: using a working medium of a heat pump (I) to absorb heat from and condense an output pressure working medium gas of a pneumatic motor (J) into a pressure working medium liquid, which is delivered as an input pressure working medium of the pneumatic motor (J); compressing, by the heat pump (I), the working medium after heat absorption to raise the temperature thereof so as to deliver the heat to the input pressure working medium, to enable the same to be heated and vaporized into a pressure working medium gas for actuating the pneumatic motor (J) and then being outputted by the pneumatic motor (J) as the output pressure working medium gas; and delivering the working medium of the heat pump (1) of which the temperature is decreased after the heat thereof has been delivered, to reabsorb heat from the output pressure working medium gas.
