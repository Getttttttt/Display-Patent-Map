abstract
    A vehicular energy management system (EMS) determines a net total power from a traction drive load, an auxiliary device load, and a regenerative power. If the net total power is a net supply power, the EMS causes regenerative power to be provided to a power source and energy source in a controlled manner to initially charge the power source to a desired state-of-charge (SOC) and then subsequently charge the energy source. If the net total power comprises a net power load, the EMS causes power to be drawn from the power source and the energy source, with a split of the power being drawn from the power source and the energy source being based on a magnitude of the net power load. The EMS adjusts/maintains the SOC set-point of the power source and the DC link voltage based on vehicle speed and relative altitude of travel of the vehicle.
