abstract
    According to one embodiment, a carbon-dioxide-recovery-type thermal power generation system includes an absorption column allows carbon dioxide contained in exhaust gas from a boiler to be absorbed in an absorption liquid, a regeneration column that discharges a carbon dioxide gas from the absorption liquid supplied from the absorption column, a reboiler that heats the absorption liquid discharged from the regeneration column and supplies steam generated, to the regeneration column, a condenser that generates condensate by cooling the steam exhausted from a turbine, a heater that heats the condensate, a water supply pump that supplies the condensate to the boiler, a line through the steam extracted from the turbine is supplied to the reboiler and the heater, and a steam flow rate adjusting unit. The steam flow rate adjusting unit maintains an amount of steam, which is extracted from the turbine through the line, to be constant.
