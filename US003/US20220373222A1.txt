abstract
    The present disclosure provides several embodiments of an adaptive, modular, energy recovery economizer section for a commercial air handling unit (AHU). The economizer section comprises an energy recovery device, a plurality of dampers, and a plurality of partition walls that allow the AHU to operate in a plurality of modes. Incorporation of the economizer section within the AHU avoids the need to split AHU into a stacked or side-by-side configuration. The economizer section may be integrated within OEM AHUs or retrofitted within existing AHUs. Retrofitting the economizer section within an existing AHU reduces the footprint of the retrofit. Moreover, when the economizer section is incorporated within an OEM AHU, the footprint and interior volume of the AHU are reduced relative to conventional OEM AHUs that comprise one or more energy recovery devices. Consequently, the economizer section improves material, fabrication, and transportation efficiencies without compromising performance of the AHU.
