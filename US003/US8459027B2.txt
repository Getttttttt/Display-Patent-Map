abstract
    Combustion engine comprising interconnected combustion cylinders (1, 2, 3, 4), comprising at least two sets of each two opposed working combustion cylinders (1, 2, 3, 4), said two cylinders of each set being interconnected by a common piston rod (5, 6), said two piston rods (5, 6) being connected by one balance arm (7), and the exploitable energy is taken from the kinetic energy of said balance arm (7).
