abstract
    A plate-shaped portion of each of separators has a cross-sectional shape bent in a concavo-convex shape in a vertical direction. The plate-shaped portion of each of the separators has a flat cross-sectional shape. The plurality of separators are arranged parallel to one another to alternately line up. One surface of each of the battery cells abuts on the plate-shaped portion of the separator, and the other surface abuts on the plate-shaped portion of the separator. Thus, a spacing between the battery cells, which are adjacent to each other with the separator sandwiched therebetween, becomes equal to the thickness of the plate-shaped portion, and a spacing between the battery cells, which are adjacent to each other with the separator sandwiched therebetween, becomes equal to the thickness of the plate-shaped portion.
