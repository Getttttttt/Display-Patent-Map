abstract
    Disclosed is a regenerative braking system capable of minimizing uncomfortable feeling during the braking operation while improving responsiveness and control performance by performing the braking operation using an electric motor. An electro-mechanical braking system is used when braking a rear wheel or front and rear wheels, so variable frictional braking is achieved, thereby maximizing the recovery rate of the regenerative energy.
