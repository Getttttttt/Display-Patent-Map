abstract
    Methods, systems, devices and apparatuses for a vehicle control system. The vehicle control system includes a memory. The memory is configured to store multiple charging events that activate multiple charging plans. The vehicle control system includes a navigation unit that is configured to obtain a current location of the vehicle. The vehicle control system includes an electronic control unit. The electronic control unit is configured to determine that the vehicle is within a threshold distance of the first charging event. The electronic control unit is configured to control an operation of the vehicle to prepare the vehicle to charge or discharge the battery based on a first charging plan when the vehicle is within the threshold distance of a first charging event.
