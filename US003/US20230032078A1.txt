abstract
    An on-board charging system for an electric vehicle comprising a generator (Dynamo) 1, coupled to the wheel of the electric vehicle. The generator produces a charging voltage which is connected to a 12 V battery, via voltage regular, the 12 V battery, and is connected to the input of a Power Boaster, which boasts the voltage from 12 V at the input to 48 V at the output. A Dual battery isolator is connected between the secondary Lithium battery and the Main lithium battery, that supply power to the a gear drive of the electric vehicle. When there is a drop in the voltage of the main lithium battery, during operation, the intelligent dual battery isolator triggers a release of the stored voltage from the secondary lithium battery pack to instantaneously charge up the main lithium battery, supplying power to the electric vehicle drive.
