abstract
    An expansion system utilizes external combustion of its residual warm exhaust air, in order to heat incoming compressed air. The heat of this external combustion is communicated to the incoming compressed air through a heat exchanger. The expansion system may be incorporated into an energy storage device also featuring a compressed air storage unit supplied by a compressor. Where the stored supply of compressed air is depleted, the energy storage device may continue to supply electricity on demand through operation as a heat engine, with the compressor being driven directly (e.g. on a same rotating shaft) or indirectly (via generated electrical power) by the expansion system. Multiple expanders of the same or different types (e.g. rotating, reciprocating), may be utilized in parallel and/or in series (e.g. multiple stages) depending upon the particular application. Multi-stage embodiments featuring internal combustion in low pressure stages, may be particularly suited for placement in vehicles.
