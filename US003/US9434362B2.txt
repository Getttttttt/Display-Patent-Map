abstract
    A braking system for an electric vehicle has a first wheel having a first friction brake and an electric motor and a second having a second friction brake. A first user-actuated brake lever is coupled to the first friction brake. The first brake lever has a first sensor indicating actuation of the first brake lever. A second user-actuated brake lever is coupled to the second friction brake. The second brake lever has a second sensor indicating actuation of the second brake lever. An electronic control unit electronically coupled to the first and second sensors and the electric motor commands the electric motor to operate as a generator when at least one of the brake levers is actuated.
