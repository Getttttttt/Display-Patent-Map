abstract
    A power transmission reception system for pairing a charge-requesting vehicle with a discharge-requesting vehicle for power transmission reception therebetween includes an extraction device and a transmitter. From each vehicle, a center acquire information about a present location, a traveling direction, and a destination point, and records the acquired information in a database while classifying the vehicle as the charge-requesting vehicle or the discharge-requesting vehicle. The extraction device extracts the charge-requesting vehicle and the discharge-requesting vehicle that are to simultaneously travel in a same area as paired vehicles in accordance with the information in the database. The transmitter generates information about a power transmission reception area and a partner vehicle in the power transmission reception, and transmits the generated information to the paired vehicles.
