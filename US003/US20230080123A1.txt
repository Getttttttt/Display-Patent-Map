abstract
    A power control system includes a battery system and a DC-DC converter with first, second, third, and fourth power switches. A second terminal of the first power switch is connected to a first terminal of the second power switch. A second terminal of the third power switch is connected to a first terminal of the fourth power switch. A first inductor includes a first terminal connected to the second terminal of the first power switch and the first terminal of the second power switch and a second terminal connected to the second terminal of the third power switch and the first terminal of the fourth power switch. A first bypass switch is connected in parallel to the first power switch. A second bypass switch is connected in parallel to the third power switch.
