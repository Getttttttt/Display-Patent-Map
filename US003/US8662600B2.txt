abstract
    A lawnmower vehicle which is a working vehicle with an electromagnetic brake includes left and right electromagnetic brakes, a brake relay which is a common brake releasing unit, and an ECU. The ECU compares electricity supply states of the left and right electromagnetic brakes, and controls the brake relay to disconnect an electrical connection between a battery and the left and right electromagnetic brakes, and to brake left and right wheels when a difference in the electricity supply states compared by a comparator exceeds an allowable upper limit.
