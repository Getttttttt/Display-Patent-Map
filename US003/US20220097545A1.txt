abstract
    An electric generator motor system for powering a vehicle and generating power includes a plurality of batteries and an electric converter in operational communication with the plurality of batteries. An electric drive motor is in operational communication with the electric converter. The electric drive motor propels a vehicle. A compressor is in operational communication with the electric converter. A plurality of air tanks is in operational communication with the compressor. An air motor is in operational communication with the plurality of air tanks. An alternator is in operational communication with the air motor and is in operational communication with the plurality of batteries to charge each battery.
