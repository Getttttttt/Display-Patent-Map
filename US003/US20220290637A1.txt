abstract
    A thermochemical recuperation (TCR) system that may use a water-alcohol mixture as an engine liquid coolant; that may include a TCR reformer configured to output a TCR product at pressure no less than twenty bars; a pressure regulator; and an TCR product accumulator configured to separate an outputting of the TCR product by the TCR reformer from a provision of the TCR product to the pressure regulator; wherein the pressure regulator is configured to provide the TCR product to a direct injector of an engine, thereby enabling the direct injector to inject the TCR product at a high pressure level—for example at a pressure level that exceeds twenty bars.
