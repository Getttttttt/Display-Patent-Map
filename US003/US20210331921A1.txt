abstract
    A system and method for recovering sulfur in a copper smelting process, in which fine dust is removed from high-concentration SO2 flue gas from a matte smelting furnace, the flue gas is introduced into a fluidized bed carbothermic reduction tower and reduced by a carbon-based reducing agent to obtain reducing gas, which is introduced into a high temperature separator. The separated reducing gas contains unsaturated powder coke, and the reducing gas is condensed to obtain sulfur. The saturated powder coke entrained enters a desorption tower to desorb SO2 gas, and the desorbed powder coke enters a fluidized bed sulfur reduction tower. Part of the SO2 gas discharged from the desorption tower is discharged to the fluidized bed carbothermic reduction tower to produce sulfur, and the other part is introduced into a desulfurization tower.
