abstract
    A furnace having a first drain trap, a first drain outlet associated with the first drain trap, and a second drain outlet associated with the first drain trap, wherein the first drain outlet and the second drain outlet are located relative to the first drain trap so that gravity driven drainage of a liquid from the first drain trap is selectable between the first drain outlet and the second drain outlet in response to a rotation of the furnace.
