abstract
    A drive device for a hybrid vehicle is provided with an engine and a motor generator. A one-way clutch is provided between the engine and the motor generator. Power is transmitted from the engine to the motor generator, while power from the motor generator to the engine is blocked. As a result, the electric motor can be operated without operating the engine. Furthermore, a torque converter is connected to the motor generator, and the engine is connected to the torque converter via a starting clutch. As a result, if a one-way clutch is provided, the motor generator can serve as a starter motor.
