abstract
    In an internal combustion engine having a system for utilizing the waste heat from the internal combustion engine via the Clausius-Rankine cycle, a system includes a circuit having lines with a working medium, a working medium pump, a vaporizer-exhaust gas heat exchanger, and a vaporizer-EGR heat exchanger, an expander, and a condenser for liquefying the vaporous working medium. The line for the working medium is run from the condenser to the vaporizer-EGR heat exchanger so that the working medium, after flowing through the condenser, first flows through the vaporizer-EGR heat exchanger, and the line for the working medium is run from the vaporizer-EGR heat exchanger to the vaporizer-exhaust gas heat exchanger so that the working medium, after flowing through the vaporizer-EGR heat exchanger, first flows through the vaporizer-exhaust gas heat exchanger.
