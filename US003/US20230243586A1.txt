abstract
    The present application discloses a pellet flue gas circulation and waste heat utilization process and a system thereof, which relates to the technical field of flue gas treatment. The system includes a grate, a rotary kiln, an annular cooler, and ducts connecting each part. On the basis of not changing the existing process a flue gas circulation unit and intelligent control equipment are arranged additionally in the present application. The process is simple, and not only can ensure the parameter stability of the production system such as temperature, gas flow or gas pressure, but also can make full use of the low and medium temperature flue gas components and the waste heat, so as to achieve net zero waste gas discharging, energy saving and emission reduction.
