abstract
    A power supply system includes a main power storage device and a plurality of sub power storage devices. A converter is connected to a selected one of the sub power storage devices to perform voltage conversion bidirectionally between the selected sub power storage device and an electric power feeding line. A control device executes charging control for controlling input of electric power from a load device to the main power storage device and selected sub power storage device, and switching control for switching electrical connection between the plurality of sub power storage devices and electric power feeding line, according to a braking request of the electric powered vehicle. The control device prohibits or limits, until completion of one of the charging control and switching control, the other control.
