abstract
    A braking system that uses a combination of a friction brake force and a traction motor brake force to slow or stop the rotation of the wheel. A friction brake may provide the friction brake force. A traction motor may provide the traction motor brake force. The braking system may include sensors that provide data for determining a wheel lock threshold for each wheel. The friction brake force and the traction motor brake force may be adjusted for each wheel to provide an applied brake force to the wheel that is less than or equal to the wheel lock threshold.
