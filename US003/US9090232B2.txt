abstract
    An ECU calculates the thermal margins of the in-wheel motors, on the basis of the thermal capacities of the in-wheel motors, the allowable limit temperatures, and the motor temperatures. Next, the ECU distributes the total requested torque between the requested torques for each wheel using the percentages of the thermal margins. The ECU controls the operation of an inverter such that the in-wheel motors generate the requested torques for the wheels. Thus, the four in-wheel motors generate uniform amounts of heat.
