abstract
    The present disclosure is directed to a system and method of providing energy to a dwelling. An engine is housed within an inner tank, which is in turn housed within an outer tank. The engine provides electricity which is used for a dwelling. Exhaust fumes from the engine are piped through a series of heat-exchanging tubes within the outer tank to heat potable water within the outer tank. Water enters the potable tank at a bottom of the tank, and warms as it rises through the outer tank toward an outlet near a top of the outer tank. Hot, potable water is provided from the top of the outer tank to the dwelling. Condensate from the exhaust is captured and used as potable water. Heat, vibration, and acoustic energy from the engine is captured by the fluid in the inner tank and transferred to the outer tank.
