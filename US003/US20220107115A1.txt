abstract
    A furnace with a condensing heat exchanger and a pH sensor, and a method of monitoring the furnace are provided. The furnace may include a condensate collector box and/or a condensate trap. At least one of the condensate collector box and/or the condensate trap may include pH sensor (e.g., disposed within the respective component). The pH sensor is configured to measure a pH level of the condensate from the condensing heat exchanger. The furnace may include a control board configured to receive the pH level from the pH sensor. The control board may be configured to trigger a notification and/or change the operation of the furnace (e.g., to dilute the condensate) based on the received pH level. The notification may include at least one of: an illumination of an indicator disposed on the furnace, and a transmission of a signal to a communicating device such as a thermostat.
