abstract
    A volatiles consuming eductor system for coated scrap metal furnaces with separate delacquering and melt chambers. Motive gas is forced through an inlet into a mixing chamber in a direction opposite a suction port, creating a Venturi that draws gases from the delaquering chamber through the mixing chamber. The motive gas and the drawn gases mix and are forced through a discharge port, ignited, and injected into the melt chamber to help heat the melt chamber. A computer monitors process conditions and controls a regulator that adjusts the motive gas flow in response to those conditions.
