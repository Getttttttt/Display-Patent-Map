abstract
    An hydraulic transmission device (10,110) comprising an hydraulic motor (16, 18), an hydraulic pump (20), a fluid accumulator (22). The device has an accumulator-driven mode, an energy-recovery mode, a pump-driven mode. In the pump-driven mode, the pump supplies the motor with fluid drawn from an unpressurized reservoir; and in the energy-recovery mode, the motor is supplied by the pump drawing fluid from said reservoir. An assembly (1) comprising a device (10,110) as defined above, a shaft (11, 13), and a mass (12, 14) mounted eccentrically on the shaft.
