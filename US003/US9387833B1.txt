abstract
    Systems and methods are provided involving a rotatable power transfer device configured with a first brake system and a second brake system. During a first of the methods, rotation of the power transfer device is braked using the first brake system. The first brake system may be actuatable by a first user interface; e.g., a brake pedal. The second brake system may be actuatable by a second user interface; e.g., a brake pedal.
