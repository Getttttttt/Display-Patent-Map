abstract
    The present disclosure provides a climate control system including a first heat exchanger having a plurality of first channels to allow flow of water therethrough, a burner to heat the water in the first channels of the first heat exchanger, and an inducer disposed proximal to the burner to direct combustion air towards the burner for combustion, and vent products of combustion. The system further includes a hydronic coil-to-air heat exchanger in fluid communication with the first heat exchanger, to receive the heated water from the first heat exchanger. The hydronic coil-to-air heat exchanger includes a plurality of second channels to allow flow of heated water therethrough. The system also includes a blower to blow air across the plurality of second channels of the hydronic coil-to-air heat exchanger, whereby the air is heated by the heated water.
