abstract
    Heat flow from a steam seal header could be used in a stage, such as a low pressure stage, of a steam turbine. However, the dump steam temperature from the steam seal header can be too high requiring removal of excess heat, typically through attemperation, before the dump steam is provided to the low pressure stage. Attemperation poses reliability and life issues and lowers efficiency. To address such short comings, one or more heat pumps are used to transfer heat from the dump steam to the fluid entering a boiler. This allows the dump steam temperature to be within acceptable limits, and at the same time, increase the temperature of the fluid so that the steam cycle performance is enhanced. Preferably, solid-state heat pumps are used as they are reliable, silent and can be precisely controlled.
