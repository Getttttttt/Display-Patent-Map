abstract
    Boiler equipment includes: a combustion device including a combustion chamber to combust fuel supplied to the combustion device; a combustion furnace including a combustion chamber formed inside thereof; and a heat exchanger transferring thermal energy obtained by combustion of the fuel in the combustion device to water. The combustion device is directly connected to a wall part of the combustion furnace such that the combustion chamber of the combustion device faces the combustion chamber of the combustion furnace. The fuel is efficiently combusted in the combustion chambers of the combustion device and the combustion furnace, which are integrated with each other. Thus, almost no ash is generated.
