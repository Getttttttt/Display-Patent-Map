abstract
    A kitchen air-conditioning system comprises a air-conditioning assembly (1) and a range hood assembly (2); the air-conditioning assembly (1) comprising a compressor (11), a first heat exchanger (12) and a second heat exchanger (13) which are connected with each other through a plurality of refrigerating medium pipes (14); and the air-conditioning assembly (1) has a fresh air inlet (16) and a fresh air outlet (17), the fresh air coming from the fresh air inlet (16) is divided into two paths; the fresh air entering the first heat exchanger (12) flows into the kitchen through the fresh air outlet (17), and the fresh air entering the air intake area (21) cools the third heat exchanger (3) in the range hood assembly (2) and is then exhausted to the outside through the range hood, which is helpful to reduce the intake-air temperature of the second heat exchanger (13), thereby improving the energy efficiency of the air conditioner.
