abstract
    Exemplary embodiments of a bicycle are provided comprising a bicycle frame having a front wheel support section, a rear wheel support section and a center section. The bicycle includes a rear wheel rotatably coupled to the rear wheel support section. The bicycle further includes a front wheel having a hub rotatably coupled to the front wheel support section, the hub being configured and integrated with an energy coil system that stores energy during a forward revolving movement of the front wheel, and when the energy is fully stored, the energy coil system is locked until selectively released.
