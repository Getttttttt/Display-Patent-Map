abstract
    A control apparatus of an electric vehicle, which is operable to be driven by supplying electric power from a battery to an electric motor to drive the electric motor and operable to perform regeneration charge, includes: a request torque calculating unit calculating a request torque of the electric motor; a motor control unit controlling the electric motor based on the request torque; and a torque suppression unit performing a feed forward control for setting the request torque based on a rotational angular speed of the electric motor so that an integrated value of a torque and a rotational angular speed of the electric motor at time when the electric motor is driven or the regeneration charge is performed is identical to an integrated value of the torque and the rotational angular speed stored at a point of time when the battery voltage or the battery current reaches the limit level.
