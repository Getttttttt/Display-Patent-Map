abstract
    The present application relates to an electric off-road vehicle charging control method, a computer device and a storage medium. The method includes: acquiring first power-condition data and second power-condition data; the first power-condition data is a cumulative number of times a feedback ratio of a vehicle-mounted energy storage system is greater than a feedback ratio threshold; the second power-condition data is a cumulative number of times the feedback ratio is less than the feedback ratio threshold; comparing a target difference with a second preset threshold, and determining a charging mode according to the comparison result; the charging mode includes a normal charging mode and a reserving margin capacity charging mode; and controlling, if the charging mode is the reserving margin capacity charging mode, the vehicle-mounted energy storage system to stop charging in a case where the state-of-charge of the vehicle-mounted energy storage system reaches a full charge control state-of-charge.
