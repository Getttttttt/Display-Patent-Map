abstract
    In one embodiment of the present invention, a system for providing a renewable source of material resources is provided comprising: a first source of renewable energy; first stream of materials from a first materials source; an electrolyzer coupled to the first source of renewable energy and the first stream of materials, wherein the electrolyzer is configured to produce a first material resource by electrolysis; a processor for further processing or use or the material resource to produce a second material resource, wherein the processor comprises a solar collector and where the solar collector is configured to provide heat to the first materials resource for disassociation; and a material resource storage coupled to the electrolyzer for receiving the material resource from the electrolyzer or providing the material resource to the processor for further processing or use.
