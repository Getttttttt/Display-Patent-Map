abstract
    A regenerative braking control system for a vehicle can include one or more user interface elements located in a cabin of the vehicle. The one or more user interface elements can correspond to a plurality of regenerative braking settings. Each of the plurality of regenerative braking settings can correspond to a different amount of regenerative braking torque to apply to one or more wheels of the vehicle. The regenerative braking control system can include a processor operatively connected to the user interface elements. The processor can be configured to detect a condition. The condition can one or more driving environment conditions. Responsive to detecting the condition, the processor can be configured to cause the amount of regenerative braking torque for one or more of the plurality of regenerative braking settings to be adjusted based on the condition.
