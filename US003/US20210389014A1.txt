abstract
    A system for use with a conditioned space. The system includes an energy transfer device and at least one element. The energy transfer device transfers heat from a hotter air flow and a cooler air flow. The energy transfer device prevents the hotter air flow from mixing with the cooler air flow. A supply one of the hotter and cooler air flows enters into the conditioned space and a return one of the hotter and cooler air flows exits from the conditioned space. The element(s) heat or cool the supply air flow before the supply air flow reaches the conditioned space.
