abstract
    A heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system includes an air handling unit configured to condition an outdoor air flow to generate a ventilation air flow. The HVAC system includes a terminal unit fluidly coupled to the air handling unit. The terminal unit includes a plenum configured to receive the ventilation air flow and a blower configured to draw a return air flow from a space serviced by the HVAC system across a heat exchanger of the terminal unit and into the plenum to condition the return air flow. The blower is configured to mix the ventilation air flow and the return air flow to generate a supply air flow. A displacement ventilation (DV) diffuser is configured to receive the supply air flow. The DV diffuser is configured to direct the supply air flow through a filter of the DV diffuser and into the space.
