abstract
    A drive control device for an electric vehicle that is driven by a motor-generator, includes: a detection unit that detects a fact that an accelerator pedal depression amount and a brake pedal depression amount of the electric vehicle are both zero; and a control unit that sets a regenerative braking torque command value for the motor-generator to zero, while the detection unit is detecting the fact.
