abstract
    An energy collection system for capturing wind energy being exhausted from an air exhaust system. The energy collection system has a frame and a wind turbine. The wind turbine has a blade configured to rotate about a shaft. Air leaving the air exhaust system in a vertical direction causes the blade to rotate which is then converted by the wind turbine into electricity.
