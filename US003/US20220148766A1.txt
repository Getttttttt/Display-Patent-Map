abstract
    A resistor includes an elongated cylindrical body having nodes and elongated members. The elongated members interconnect the nodes to form openings between the nodes and the elongated members for the flow therethrough of a cooling fluid. The body is configured to receive electric current from a powered system and to conduct and provide electric resistance to the electric current to dissipate at least part of the electric current as heat from the body. The body may be coupled with at least one other resistor of the powered system in one or more of a parallel or series arrangement in an electric circuit.
