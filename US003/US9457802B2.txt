abstract
    A vehicle executing a turn will most likely be slowed down before the turn and when a driver activates a turn signal to indicate the turn, a vehicle internal controller uses this information to engage regenerative braking for energy recapture while slowing down the vehicle for the pending turn. Since the turn signal is usually activated very early in the turn event, and turns are an ongoing, frequent part of driving, a greater overall vehicle efficiency can be realized without special effort from the driver. Implementation is relatively simple for the manufacturer and adds no cost since the controllers and sensors are already installed on nearly all roadworthy vehicles. Fuel mileage and vehicle driving ranges are improved on a large scale and brake system wear is reduced.
