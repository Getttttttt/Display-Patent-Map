abstract
    In one embodiment, a waste heat recovery system includes multiple organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems arranged in a cascade configuration. Each ORC system includes a heat exchanger that transfers heat to the working fluid to vaporize the working fluid. Each ORC system also includes an integrated power module that expands the working fluid to generate electricity.
