abstract
    One object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing inorganic spheroidized particles which can significantly reduce the amount of warming gas generated and suppress the generation of soot during combustion. The present invention provides an apparatus (10) for producing inorganic spheroidized particles, including a burner (11) for producing inorganic spheroidized particles, a vertical spheroidizing furnace (15), an ammonia supply source (12), an oxygen supply source (13), an ammonia supply line (L1) located between the ammonia supply source (12) and the burner (11) for producing inorganic spheroidized particles, and an oxygen supply line (L2) located between the oxygen supply source (13) and the burner (11) for producing inorganic spheroidized particles.
