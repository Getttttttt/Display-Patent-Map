abstract
    A method of cooling a liner in a plasma chamber. A recycle gas is contacted with or passed through the liner to cool the liner and pre-heat the recycle gas. The pre-heated gas is then recycled through the plasma chamber to become part of the plasma forming process. The method further comprises the liner is graphite, the recycle gas passes through at least one cooling channel present in the liner, at least one of the cooling channels are covered with at least one removable liner/channel cover, carbon deposits are formed from the presence of hydrocarbons in the recycle gas, at least one channel is formed in a spiral cooling channel pattern, at least one channel is formed in a substantially straight cooling channel pattern, and a plenum to aid in the production of an even distribution of cooling gas in the channels.
