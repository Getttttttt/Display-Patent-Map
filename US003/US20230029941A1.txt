abstract
    A system and method of transferring heat from the ground is described. At least one heat pipe is provided that has a hollow interior, a heat output end, and a heat input end. The heat output end is positioned higher that the heat input end. The hollow interior contains a working fluid that transfers heat from the input end to the output end. The working fluid is a liquid at a first temperature and a gas at a second temperature where the second temperature is greater than the first temperature. The working fluid becomes a gas as it is heated at the heat input end and returns to a liquid at the heat output end of the pipe when the heat is transferred out of the heat pipe. The heat transferred from the heat output end of the heat pipe is captured for future use.
