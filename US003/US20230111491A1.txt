abstract
    A system for treating tin smelting intermediate materials and method for treating the materials is disclosed. The system includes a fuming furnace, an electric settling furnace, a lean slag water quenching pool, a matte ladle, a pulverized coal injection system, a flue gas treatment system and a secondary air supply system; the fuming furnace is connected with the electric settling furnace, the pulverized coal injection system, the flue gas treatment system and the secondary air supply system respectively; the electric settling furnace is also connected with the slag-lean water quenching pool and the matte ladle respectively. The system and method disclosed by the disclosure can efficiently classify, separate and recover tin from other materials, solve the problems of difficult sales and transportation of complex tin-containing smelting intermediate materials and economic loss of discounted sales, and transform hazardous wastes into value-added valuable materials for comprehensive recovery.
