abstract
    Methods and systems for modulating regenerative braking in a vehicle having a regenerative braking system and an energy storage system are provided. A value is obtained for a variable pertaining to a condition that affects energy absorption of the energy storage system. A regenerative braking torque capacity for the regenerative braking system is determined using the value. Regenerative braking is controlled via the regenerative braking system based at least in part on the regenerative braking torque capacity.
