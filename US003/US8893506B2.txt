abstract
    Disclosed is a method for operating an IGCC power plant, wherein the coal gas from a gasifier, comprising CO and hydrogen, is supplied to at least one shift stage, wherein this is converted primarily into CO2 and hydrogen and the coal gas is subjected to at least one gas cleaning step. The coal gas is conducted over a membrane, which at least partially selectively separates the hydrogen from the coal gas. In order to achieve driving potential in the membrane, a flushing gas is used on the permeate side. The hydrogen depleted retentate is fed to a CO2 conditioning process, while the separated hydrogen is fed together with the flushing gas to a gas turbine as fuel gas. The flushing gas used for the membrane is a component of the waste gas produced in the gas turbine after the waste gas has left the waste heat recovery boiler, which is connected downstream of the gas turbine. In the power plant, the gas turbine also functions as a means for providing the flushing gas. The power plant comprises a line from the waste heat recovery boiler connected downstream of the gas turbine to the permeate side of the membrane.
