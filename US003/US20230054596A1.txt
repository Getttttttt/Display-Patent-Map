abstract
    A spool valve for controlling the flow of a fluid into a reciprocating piston cylinder. A spool is slideably inserted into an outer casing, the spool valve having a first and a second non-waisted end portions and having a waisted middle portion. The casing has an intake port and output port for fluids entering and exiting the casing. A first non-waisted end portion covers the intake port during a first valve-closed event as the spool slides in one direction within the casing. The waisted middle portion is sufficiently wide to uncover both the intake port and the output port during a valve-open event as the spool slides in one direction within the casing. A second non-waisted end portion covers the output port during a second valve-closed event as the spool slides in the same one direction within the casing.
