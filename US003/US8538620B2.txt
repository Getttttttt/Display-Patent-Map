abstract
    A vehicle speed VSP enters a creep-cutoff-prohibiting speed region lower than V1 with a forward creep torque being outputted (t1), and then this state continues for a time duration set corresponding to a timer value NTM1 (t2). At this time, a creep cutoff is prohibited by setting a creep-cutoff-prohibition flag NFLAG at “1”. A braking force becomes larger than or equal to a creep-cutoff-permitting braking-force value to satisfy a creep-cutoff permitting condition related to the braking force (t3) while a creep-cutoff permitting condition related to the vehicle speed has been satisfied because of almost zero of the vehicle speed VSP. In response thereto, the creep-cutoff permitting flag FLAG is set at 1 at t4. However, the creep toque continues to be outputted also after t4 without the creep cutoff, so that a torque reduction accompanied with strangeness feeling can be prevented.
