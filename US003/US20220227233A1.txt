abstract
    Look-ahead deceleration assistance control includes: accelerator-off guidance control that is control to, when a target location related to deceleration of an electrically-powered vehicle is set, notify a driver of information prompting the driver to release an accelerator pedal; and regeneration increasing control that is control to, when the target location related to deceleration of the electrically-powered vehicle is set, increase a braking force generated by a motor generator as compared to when the target location is not set. The strong regeneration control is control to, when the strong regeneration mode is set by a switch operating unit, increase the braking force in a state where the accelerator pedal is released as compared to the normal mode. The control apparatus is configured to, when the strong regeneration mode is set by the switch operating unit, execute the strong regeneration control and not execute the look-ahead deceleration assistance control.
