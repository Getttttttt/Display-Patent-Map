abstract
    A furnace system includes a furnace facility disposed on a conveyer device and having a pre-heating zone, a high temperature heating zone, and two cooling zones, and the conveyer device moves the work piece from the pre-heating zone through the high temperature heating zone and the cooling zones, two heating members disposed in the heating zones for pre-heating and heating the work piece, two piping members coupled between the cooling zones and the heating zones for recycling the waste heat gas, and two blowing devices draw the waste gas from the cooling zones to the heating zones for recycling and economizing the heat energy and for preventing the steel materials from being distorted or twisted.
