abstract
    A method and a device are for prediction and adaptation of movement trajectories of a vehicle for assisting the driver and/or for preventing or reducing the severity of a collision. Situatively required movement trajectories for assisting the driver or collision avoidance are determined using an environment sensor system. Physically possible movement trajectories are determined from characteristic properties of the driving dynamics of the vehicle and from the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road up to a maximum coefficient of friction. An intersection between the above two sets of trajectories is determined, and only trajectories that are included in this intersection are taken into account for the prediction and adaptation of movement trajectories for the driving assistance or collision avoidance function.
