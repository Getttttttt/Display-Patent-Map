abstract
    A full-heat ventilation fan (1) having a double-layer air duct, comprising: a fresh air duct that communicates with an outdoor air inlet (121) and an indoor air outlet (124), and comprises a first downstream section; an air return duct that communicates with an indoor air inlet (123) and an outdoor air outlet (122), and comprises a first upstream section; and a full-heat exchange core (15), which comprises a fresh air channel and an air return channel that can carry out heat exchange, the fresh air channel being disposed within the fresh air duct or forming a part of the fresh air duct, the air return channel being disposed within the air return duct or forming a part of the air return duct, and part of the first downstream section and part of the first upstream section being upper and lower layers within the vertical plane, so as to form a double-layer air duct. The full-heat ventilation fan not only helps to reduce wind resistance and improve efficiency, but also achieves low noise operation.
