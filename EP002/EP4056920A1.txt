abstract
    A combined system for heating (1) a main water circuit (30) comprising a condensing boiler (20) and a heat pump (11, 12, 13, 14, 16). The boiler (20) has a combustion fumes outlet (23), the heat pump (11, 12, 13, 14, 16) comprises a refrigerant circuit (11) in which a refrigerant fluid flows and a first heat exchanger (12) crossed by the circuit (11) in which the refrigerant fluid receives heat passing from a liquid state to a gaseous state. The combined heating system (1) comprises a duct (40) extending between the fumes outlet (23) of the boiler (20) and said first heat exchanger (12) so as to carry the fumes coming from the fumes outlet (23) at the first heat exchanger (12).
