abstract
    A rooftop air conditioning unit (100) includes a cabinet (114), an energy recovery wheel (122) rotatably mounted within the cabinet, and a controller. The energy recovery wheel can transfer heat between an outdoor air stream and a return air stream when rotated into an operational position and will not transfer heat when rotated into a bypass position. The controller can select the operational position of the energy recovery wheel and an operational mode of the energy recovery wheel.
