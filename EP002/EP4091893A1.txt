abstract
    An ACE heavy truck fuel saving system provided by the present disclosure is based on a double-motor mixed hybrid powertrain system architecture, especially an electrical power split device. Under the condition that no new hardware device is added, the transmission path, direction and amplitude of hundred-kilowatt-level mechanical or electric power flow among all vehicle-mounted power subsystems are dynamically regulated and controlled through software definition or remote iteration updating, new functions of vehicle longitudinal driving control and electromechanical energy management are flexibly established or the existing functions are timely improved, the SAE LI-level automatic driving function is achieved, therefore, the power performance, fuel consumption, pollutant emission and active safety of the complete vehicle can be optimized at the same time, and the actual energy-saving and emission-reducing effect of ACE heavy truck operation is basically decoupled from the performance of a vehicle engine and the driving level of a driver. A cloud-end and vehicle-end collaborative fuel saving data set is combined with a machine learning fuel saving algorithm, so that the fuel saving system has the capabilities of automatic learning and autonomous evolution in the life cycle of the vehicle, and energy saving and emission reduction of the vehicle can be continuously optimized.
