abstract
    A condensing boiler comprising: a casing; a burner housed in the casing and configured to produce heating gas; a heat exchanger housed in the casing, the heat exchanger being supplied with the heating gas from the burner and configured to heat a working fluid; and a drain circuit configured to drain the condensate generated by the condensation of the heating gas in the heat exchanger; the drain circuit comprising a siphon housed in the casing and an external drain duct; in which the casing comprises a bottom wall provided with a drain hole where the condensate passes from the siphon to the external drain duct; wherein the external duct is coupled to the bottom wall of the casing independently from the siphon in such a way that even without the siphon the external drain duct remains coupled to the casing.
