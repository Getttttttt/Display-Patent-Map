abstract
    The invention refers to an HVAC system for a building (10) comprising a heat pump system, a ventilation system with a ventilation unit (28) and an air duct (30), a utilization-side unit (20) with a utilization-side heat exchanger (22) connected to the heat pump system, an air outlet (32) connected to the air duct (30) and an outlet valve (34) for adjusting the amount of air (18) flowing through the air outlet (32) into the indoor space (10a,10b), a sensor (44,46) for detecting a parameter of the indoor space (10a,10b), and a control unit (26) for controlling the outlet valve (34) based on the parameter detected by the sensor (44,46).
