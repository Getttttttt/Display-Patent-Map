abstract
    The disclosed vehicle braking device controls a hydraulic brake system (2) and a regeneration brake system (3) mounted on a vehicle (1) in accordance with an acceleration value and a brake value, and includes a first divider (11), a second divider (12), and a controller (13). The first divider (11) divides a driver demand torque set according to the accelerator value into a target coast torque and a remaining torque. The second divider (12) divides a sum of a deceleration torque set according to the brake value and the target coast torque divided by the first divider (11) into a hydraulic-brake demand torque and a regeneration-brake demand torque. The controller (13) controls the hydraulic brake system (2), using the hydraulic-brake demand torque, and controls the regeneration brake system (3), using a total regeneration brake torque calculated from the remaining torque and the regeneration-brake demand torque. This configuration can improve the feeling of operating the brake, resolving the feeling of the shortage of deceleration.
