abstract
    The invention relates to an airflow inverter device for the mounting and installation of heat recuperators (1) arranged in facing connection positions with respect to common downward ducts (2) and (3) for air extraction and impulsion. The device is characterised in that it comprises a prismatic body (6), which has ducts (7) longitudinally defined therein which cross one another without communication between the same, the ends of said ducts (7) flowing into mouths (8) and (9) which are in transversely inverted positions at the ends of the aforementioned prismatic body (1).
