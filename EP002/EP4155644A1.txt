abstract
    A fluid container that can prevent a container from being in contact with a heat source fluid and stably hold the heat source fluid, even if corrosive, in the container to perform heat recovery and the like. A first fluid and a second fluid are both allowed to flow into and out of a container body 10. The second fluid is supplied into the container body by a second fluid supply unit 30 to form a layer of the second fluid flowing down along an inner surface of the container body 10, causing the second fluid to be interposed between the first fluid and the inner surface of the container body. This eliminates deterioration of the container body due to corrosion of the container body by the fact that the first fluid has contact with the inner surface of the container body, as well as scale precipitation from the first fluid.
