abstract
    Multi-fuel boiler (100) comprising:- a burner (102) configured to receive and mix a fuel and an oxidizer;- a heat exchanger (103) placed near the burner (102) and configured to connect to a plumbing (104), the heat exchanger (103) being configured to receive a fluid to be heated and to send a heated fluid from/to said plumbing (104);- an electrolysis device (105) connected to the burner (102) and configured to generate gaseous hydrogen and feed the generated gaseous hydrogen as fuel for the burner (102).
