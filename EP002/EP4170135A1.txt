abstract
    Power and cooling systems (100; 400) including a drive system (106; 406; 500), a power generation unit (102; 402; 514), and a cooled fluid generation unit (104; 404; 518). A primary working fluid that is expanded within a turbine (114; 412; 504) of the drive system (106; 406; 500) and compressed within compressors (116, 118; 506, 508, 510) in a closed-loop cycle. The power generation unit (102; 402; 514) includes a generator (132; 414) and a heat source configured to heat the primary working fluid prior to injection into the turbine (114; 412; 504). T cooled fluid generation unit (104; 404; 518) includes an ejector (140; 420) downstream of the compressors (116, 118; 506, 508, 510) and a separator (142) arranged downstream of the ejector (140; 420) and configured to separate liquid and gaseous portions of the primary working fluid. The gaseous portion is directed to the compressors (116, 118; 506, 508, 510) and the liquid portion is directed to an evaporator heat exchanger (144; 428) to generate cooled fluid.
