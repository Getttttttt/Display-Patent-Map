abstract
    A system and method for operating a transport refrigeration system (200) including: a trailer system (100) including a vehicle (102) connected to a transport container (106); an electric generation device (340) operably connected to a wheel axle (365) of the trailer system (100), the electric generation device (340) configured to rotate at an operating frequency, and to generate electrical power from the rotational energy of the wheel axle (365) for charging an energy storage device (334) when the electric generation device (340) is activated; an energy management system (330) for providing power to the transportation refrigeration unit (22) of the trailer system (100), the energy management system (330) including an energy controller (336) in communication with at least one of the electric generation device (340) and the energy storage device (334), wherein the energy controller (336) is configured to modify the operation of the electric generation device (340) when the operating frequency of the electric generation device (340) is equal to or less than an energy controller (336) operating limit.
