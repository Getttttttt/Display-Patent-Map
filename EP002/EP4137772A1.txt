abstract
    An energy recovery system (1) for a grate cooler (5) is presented, being comprised by an organic cycle waste heat recovery subsystem (2), adapted to collect Excess-Air (α) from a grate cooler, and to generate energy from the heat contained in said Excess-Air; an Excess-Air recirculation subsystem (4), configured to introduce Excess-Air (θ) into the grate cooler (5); and a control subsystem, configured to control the temperature inside the grate cooler (5) by acting on the energy to be supplied to the Excess-Air recirculation subsystem (4), as a function of at least the energy generated by the organic cycle waste heat recovery subsystem (2). Additionally, the system may further comprise an Excess-Air temperature adjustment subsystem (3) adapted to collect Excess-Air (β) at the outlet of the organic cycle waste heat recovery subsystem (2), and configured to supply Excess-Air (θ) to the inlet of the Excess-Air recirculation subsystem (4).
