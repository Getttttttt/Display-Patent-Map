abstract
    There are included a transmission mechanism interposed in a power transfer path between a drive source and wheels; an oil pressure control device that can supply lubricating oil to the transmission mechanism; and a control part that can output an electrical instruction to the oil pressure control device to increase a flow rate of lubricating oil supplied to the transmission mechanism. When the control part outputs an electrical instruction to the oil pressure control device to increase a flow rate of lubricating oil supplied to the transmission mechanism, and determines that the flow rate of lubricating oil supplied to the transmission mechanism from the oil pressure control device does not increase as indicated by the electrical instruction (time t1), the control part considers that the oil pressure control device is in an abnormal state, and can impose a limitation that an absolute value of torque of the transmission mechanism transferred between the wheels and the drive source be reduced (time t1-t5).
