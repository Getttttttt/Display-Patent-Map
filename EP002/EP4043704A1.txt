abstract
    The invention relates to a cooling device (1) for a vehicle, the cooling device (1) comprising at least one thermoacoustic converter (8) configured to convert waste heat (10) from at least one first component (2) of the vehicle into at least one acoustic waves (9) and to provide the acoustic waves (9). The cooling device (1) further comprises at least one thermoacoustic heat pump (11) configured to receive the acoustic waves (9) and to use the received acoustic waves (9) to cool at least one cooling fluid (12) for cooling at least one second component (6) of the vehicle.
