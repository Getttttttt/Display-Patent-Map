abstract
    An hydraulic distributor comprises at least one main spool configured to define a delivery branch, and a discharge branch, a feed branch and a pressure compensator configured such that a local pressure acts on a first side thereof and a maximum Load Sensing pressure acts on a second side characterising either the working pressure of the hydraulic section, in the case in which there is only one hydraulic section, or, in the case in which there is a plurality of hydraulic sections, each one defining a respective characteristic pressure, of the maximum pressure among the characteristic pressures of the hydraulic sections. The pressure compensator is arranged such as to respectively intercept said delivery branch and said discharge branch.
