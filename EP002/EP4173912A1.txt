abstract
    The disclosure relates to a method for determining a starting condition for cleaning a brake disk. A first step (S1) of this method determines that an amount of rust on the brake disk exceeds a predefined threshold. Additionally, an energy quantity being necessary for removing the amount of rust from the brake disk is determined (S2). In a further step (S3), a distribution of brake energy over a current drive is estimated by using at least one parameter describing historic driving behavior and at least one parameter characterizing the current drive cycle. Subsequently, a starting speed and a starting brake force request is derived (S4). Additionally, a method for cleaning a brake disk is presented which comprises the determination of a starting condition for cleaning the brake disk by the method mentioned before. Moreover, a data processing device comprising means for carrying out said methods is explained.
