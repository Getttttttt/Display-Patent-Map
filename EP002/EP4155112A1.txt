abstract
    A method and an apparatus for obtaining a coasting torque, a storage medium, and a computer program , this method includes: obtaining operating parameters of an electric vehicle when a fuel cell system of the electric vehicle is out of operation and the electric vehicle enters a coasting state; determining a theoretical recovery torque and a correction torque of the electric vehicle according to the operating parameters, where the correction torque includes an additional torque of the fuel cell system; and correcting the theoretical recovery torque according to the correction torque to obtain the coasting torque of the electric vehicle. The coasting torque is used for energy recovery of the electric vehicle during a coasting process.
