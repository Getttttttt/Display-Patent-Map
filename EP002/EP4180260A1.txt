abstract
    A control device (80) is installable in a mobile body including a motor (31) and a battery (33) and a regenerative drive of the motor and an actuation of a braking device (41, 42, 43, 44) allow a braking force to be applied to the mobile body. The control device includes: an abnormality detector (61) detecting an abnormality in the braking device; and a motor controller (60) controlling the motor. When a regenerative torque generated by the regenerative drive of the motor when the braking device is normal is defined as a normal regenerative torque, the motor controller causes, in response to the abnormality detector detecting the abnormality in the braking device, the motor to be regeneratively driven irrespective of a charged state of the battery until the elapse of a predetermined grace time from a point of time when the abnormality is detected so that an emergency regenerative torque larger than the normal regenerative torque is generated.
