abstract
    A control method for an electric vehicle using a motor as a traveling drive source to decelerate by a regenerative braking force of the motor, including: obtaining an accelerator operation amount; estimating a disturbance torque acting on a vehicle body of the electric vehicle; obtaining an angular velocity of a rotating body that correlates to a rotation speed of a drive shaft which drives the electric vehicle; calculating a first torque command value based on the accelerator operation amount; setting the first torque command value to a torque command value; controlling a torque generated in the motor based on the torque command value; setting a target stop position at the time of stopping the electric vehicle; calculating a target angular velocity of the rotating body according to a distance from the electric vehicle to the target stop position; calculating a second torque command value for stopping the electric vehicle at the target stop position based on a difference between the target angular velocity and the obtained angular velocity; and converging the torque command value to the disturbance torque by setting the second torque command value to the torque command value and adjusting the braking and driving forces of the motor according to a distance to the target stop position, when the accelerator operation amount decreases or becomes zero and the electric vehicle is about to stop.
