abstract
    The present subject matter relates to a method, a controller, and a computer program product for controlling an on-board energy storage system of a dual-mode rail vehicle. The dual-mode rail vehicle may comprise a high-voltage system, to draw energy from a high-voltage AC line supply, and an on-board energy storage such as a traction battery. The method may comprise the steps of determining a present value of recoverable energy, receiving a present value of energy stored in an on-board energy storage, adding both values to determine a total energy value, comparing the total energy value with a target energy value, determining a required line current depending on the difference between the target energy value and the total energy value, transmitting a minimum value from the determined required line current and a predetermined maximum line current as line current reference value to a high-voltage system controller, and controlling a line current of the rail vehicle according to the line current reference value.
