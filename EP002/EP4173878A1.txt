abstract
    Systems and methods for operating an electric motor of a two-wheeled vehicle. One method includes detecting a position of a drive torque control included in the vehicle, detecting a position of a regenerative brake control included in the vehicle, mapping the detected position of the drive torque control to a requested driving torque, mapping the position of the regenerative brake control to a requested braking torque, determining, with an electronic control unit, a torque command based on the requested driving torque and the requested torque, and transmitting the torque command to an electric motor included in the vehicle.
