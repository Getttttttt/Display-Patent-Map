abstract
    This gas turbine plant is provided with a gas turbine; a waste heat recovery boiler which generates steam by exchanging heat between exhaust gas from the gas turbine and water, an absorption tower which recovers carbon dioxide contained in the exhaust gas; an EGR line which bleeds a portion of the exhaust gas and guides the same to the intake side of the gas turbine; an exhaust gas heater which uses steam extracted from the waste heat recovery boiler as a heat medium to heat the exhaust gas that has passed through the absorption tower, by exchanging heat between the heat medium and the exhaust gas; and an EGR heater which is provided on the EGR line, and which heats the exhaust gas passing through the EGR line by exchanging heat between the exhaust gas passing through the EGR line and the heat medium discharged from the exhaust gas heater.
