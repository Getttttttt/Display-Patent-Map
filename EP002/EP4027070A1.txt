abstract
    A total heat recovery defrosting control method and control system (10), and an air conditioning apparatus. The method comprises the following steps: operating in a heating mode or a hot water mode; determining whether the current operating status satisfies a defrosting operating condition; if the current operating status satisfies the defrosting operating condition, comparing a heating demand with a hot water demand; if the heating demand is higher than the hot water demand, executing a hot-water defrosting mode; and if the hot water demand is higher than the heating demand, executing a heating defrosting mode. The control system (10) is provided with a defrosting determination module (101), a comparison module (102), and an execution module (103). By means of comparing the heat demand of a total heat recovery set on the heating and water heating of an air conditioner, a heat exchanger demanding less heat is selected to perform defrosting, thus avoiding a great amount of heat being lost by the heat exchanger in an operating mode, reducing the influence thereof on the usage experience of a user, and ensuring a heating demand or hot water demand of the user.
