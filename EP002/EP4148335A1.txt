abstract
    A heat recovery ventilation unit (10) comprising- a polygonal heat exchanger (20) and a housing (30) comprising insulation material, wherein the polygonal heat exchanger (20) and the housing (30) define- a first inlet (42) and a first outlet (44) defining a first airstream pathway (40) from the first inlet (42) to the first outlet (44) through the polygonal heat exchanger (20);- a second inlet (52) and a second outlet (54) defining a second airstream pathway (50) from the second inlet (52) to the second outlet (54) through the polygonal heat exchanger (20);- the housing (30) further comprises- a bypass channel (32) arranged to bypass the polygonal heat exchanger (20) along the first airstream pathway (40), thereby defining a bypass airstream pathway (34),- an airstream swap unit (60) downstream to the polygonal heat exchanger (20) and the bypass airstream pathway (32), the airstream swap unit (60) being configurable betweena heat recovery position (62), where the bypass airstream pathway (34) is blocked, anda bypass position (64), where the first airstream pathway (50) is blocked.
