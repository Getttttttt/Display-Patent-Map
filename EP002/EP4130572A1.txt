abstract
    A heat exchange bank (4',4",4â€´), suitable for carrying out a heat exchange between a first and a second fluid at different temperatures, comprising an exchange apparatus (6) provided with a tube bundle (8), internally traversed by said first fluid; containment means (10) of said second fluid, suitable for accommodating said exchange apparatus (6) so that at least a portion of said tube bundle (8) is lapped externally by said second fluid. The exchange apparatus (6) comprises support means (9) that are structurally distinct from said containment means (10) and to which an upper end (12) of said tube bundle (8) is operatively connected; the support means (9) comprise at least a chain (60) comprising a plurality of links (61) concatenated in series with each other, said chain (60) extending parallel to the tubes of said tube bundle (8) and being provided with an anti-rotation device (62), configured so as to prevent or at least limit a rotation of the chain (60) and the tube bundle (8) about an axis of rotation parallel to said tubes.
