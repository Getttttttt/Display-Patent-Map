abstract
    The gas turbine engine (1) comprises a compressor (2), a combustion system (3) and a turbine (4). The combustion system (3) comprises a heat exchanger (6) for heating compressed air from the compressor (2) to a predefined temperature, a burner (7) for mixing the compressed air from the heat exchanger (6) with a fuel generating a fuel-air mixture, and a combustion chamber (9) where the fuel-air mixture is combusted by autoignition. The fuel is preferably hydrogen or a mixture with at least 70% hydrogen content by volume.
