abstract
    The present invention is a vehicle driving system including a rotating electric machine, a battery, a steering apparatus, a steering angle sensor, a brake actuator that applies a friction braking force, a friction braking force sensor, and a controller that sets deceleration torque based on a steering speed detected by the steering angle sensor and controls the rotating electric machine such that the deceleration torque is applied to a front wheel of the vehicle, thereby executing vehicle attitude control, characterized in that when the friction braking force is applied to each of wheels by the brake actuator during execution of the vehicle attitude control, if the friction braking force detected by the friction braking force sensor is large, the controller corrects the deceleration torque to a larger value than when the friction braking force is small.
