abstract
    This application provides a heat exchange module and a cabinet. The heat exchange module is used in the cabinet. The cabinet further includes a cabinet body. The cabinet body has a first space and a second space. A temperature of the first space is higher than a temperature of the second space. The heat exchange module has a first air circulation system and a second air circulation system, and heat exchange may be performed between the first air circulation system and the second air circulation system. Both an air intake vent and an air exhaust vent of the first air circulation system are configured to be connected to the first space. An air exhaust vent of the second air circulation system is connected to an external space, and an air intake vent of the second air circulation system can be configured to be selectively connected to the external space and/or the second space. The air intake vent of the second air circulation system may be selected to obtain air from the external space and/or the second space according to heat dissipation requirements of the first space and the second space. Heat dissipation of the first space and/or the second space can be implemented by using one heat exchange module. Therefore, flexibility is high.
