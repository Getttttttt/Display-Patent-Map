abstract
    A heat exchanging element includes a first passage forming member (1) and a second passage forming member stacked alternately. The first passage forming member (1) and the second passage forming member each include: a rib portion (31) including a first wall portion constituting an end in a first direction of the first passage, a second wall portion constituting an end in the first direction of the second passage, and a third wall portion separating the first passage and the second passage adjacent to each other in a second direction from each other; a board (15) being in contact with an end (37) in a third direction of the rib portion (31), and separating a first connection passage communicating with the first passage and a second connection passage communicating with the second passage from each other; a first blocking portion (38) installed at the end (37) of the rib portion (31), to block between the first passage and the second connection passage; and a second blocking portion (39) installed at the end (37) of the rib portion (31), to block between the second passage and the first connection passage.
