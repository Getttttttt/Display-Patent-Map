abstract
    A method and apparatus for distributing the electric braking power of a hybrid electric tram, and a medium. The method comprises: during the braking of a traction motor, acquiring the braking voltage value and braking current value of a traction inverter system; obtaining the energy consumption power of an energy consumption system, the output power of a one-way power supply system, and the maximum charging power of an energy storage system; according to the energy consumption power, the output power, the maximum charging power, the number of traction inverters, and the braking voltage value, calculating the maximum current limiting value fed back to a bus by a single traction inverter; and dynamically controlling the on/off of a braking resistor system according to the braking current value and the maximum current limiting value. When the braking power exceeds the carrying capacity of the energy storage system, the excess power is consumed on the braking resistor system to ensure that there is no overcurrent on the energy storage system; when the braking power is within the carrying capacity of the energy storage system, all the braking power is fed back to the energy storage system, thereby implementing reasonable distribution of braking energy, and improving the utilization rate of braking energy.
