abstract
    A method of controlling a tone of an electric vehicle (EV) includes calculating order components from vibration signals of a rotating motor of the EV, extracting an Nth order component having a determination coefficient R2 which represents linearity with respect to an output torque of the motor and is greater than or equal to a predetermined value, converting an RPM of the motor into a frequency and calculating an order frequency, arranging the order components by applying a vibration level of the Nth order component to a level of the order frequency to be output and setting an EV mode tone, and in a deceleration of the EV, determining a deceleration condition and applying the vibration level of the Nth order component to level control of the order frequency.
