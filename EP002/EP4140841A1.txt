abstract
    A Level IV fuel-saving robot system for ACE HDTs of the present disclosure focuses on the minimization of actual fuel consumption (L/100 km) for long-haul freight at first based on an electrical power split device (ePSD) and a mixed hybrid powertrain architecture. A basic model Level I fuel-saving robot realizes a longitudinal L1 automatic driving function through a predictive adaptive cruise (PACC) technology within an Operational Design Domain (ODD) for highways and reduces the actual fuel consumption of an ACE HDT by more than 20% compared with modern diesel HDTs, and the energy-saving and emission-reducing effect of the basic model Level I fuel-saving robot is decoupled from both the technical level of a vehicle engine and the driving level of a driver; an advanced Level IV fuel-saving robot has a L4 automatic driving function within the ODD for highways, operates in a "shadow mode" or "detached mode", automatically generates a discrepancy report or detachment report, completes the "3R" batch validation for an L4 system on a billion mile scale quickly with high cost effectiveness on the premise of ensuring the traffic safety of existing road users and reduces the total validation expense by more than 65% compared with the modern HDT with internal combustion engine equipped with the L4 system, promoting the early commercialization of the Level IV fuel-saving robot.
