abstract
    A recovery steam generator (4) comprises:a flue-gases flowing chamber (11) extending along a longitudinal axis (A) and provided with an inlet (16) and an outlet (17);a steam circuit (14) supplied with water and extending at least partially within the flue-gases flowing chamber (11) so as to exploit the heat of the flue-gases to generate steam; the steam circuit (14) comprising:• a superheating section (20) comprising at least two superheating banks (22; 27) arranged in series with each other;• a plurality of connecting pipes (25, 29) configured to connect the at least two superheating banks (22; 27) in series with each other;• at least a plurality of first injection pipes (30; 31) configured to inject a first heat transfer fluid into each of the connecting pipes (25; 25, 29);• a control device (34) configured to regulate the flow rate of the first heat transfer fluid supplied via the first injection pipes (30; 31).
