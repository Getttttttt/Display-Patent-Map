abstract
    A system includes a power cycle and a cooling cycle. The power cycle includes a first compressor (12), a recuperative heat exchanger (14), a waste-heat heat exchanger (16), and a turbine (18). The turbine (18) includes a drive shaft coupled to the first compressor. The working fluid from the waste-heat heat exchanger (16) drives the turbine (18), the drive shaft, and the first compressor (12). The recuperative heat exchanger (14) cools the working fluid from the turbine (18), and at least one ram-air heat exchanger further cools the working fluid from the recuperative heat exchanger (14). The first compressor (12) is configured to pressurize the working fluid from the at least one ram-air heat exchanger. The cooling cycle includes a pump (32), an isenthalpic valve (36), an ambient air heat exchanger (38), and a second compressor (40). The cooling cycle cools the working fluid and ambient air and is connected to the power cycle in the at least one ram-air heat exchanger.
