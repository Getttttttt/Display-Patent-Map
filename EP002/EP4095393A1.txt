abstract
    A hydraulic distributor comprises at least one main spool configured to define a delivery segment, and a discharge segment, a supply segment and a pressure compensator configured in such a way that acting on one of a first side thereof is a local pressure and acting on a second side is a maximum Load Sensing pressure either characteristic of the working pressure of the hydraulic user, in the case single hydraulic user is present, or, in the case of a plurality of hydraulic users are present, each defining a respective characteristic pressure, characteristic of the maximum pressure among the characteristic pressures of the hydraulic users. The pressure compensator comprises at least three ways, of which a third way is configured in such a way as to connect the discharge segment with an energy recovery stretch connectable to an energy recovery device. The pressure compensator comprises a position sensor configured to detect the position of said pressure compensator and transmit it to a control unit operatively connected to the energy recovery device.
