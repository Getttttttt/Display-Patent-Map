abstract
    A gas turbine system (100) includes a gas turbine (12) and a water circuit (102). The water circuit (102) includes a supply line (104) fluidly coupling the low pressure economizer (40) to a low pressure water supply (118). A connection line (106) fluidly couples the low pressure evaporator (42) to the low pressure economizer (40). A bypass supply line (108) extends between the connection line (106) and a heat exchanger. A bypass return line (112) extends from the heat exchanger and includes a first return branch (114) and a second return branch (116). The first return branch (114) extends to the supply line (104). The second return branch (116) extends to the connection line (106). At least one first diverter valve (120) is disposed on the bypass return line (112). The at least one first diverter valve (120) is operable to direct the flow of water towards one or both of the supply line (104) and the connection line (106).
