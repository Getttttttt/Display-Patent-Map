abstract
    A field air-conditioner (1) is described, comprising:- an air-conditioner body (2) comprising an external casing (3);- an internal return duct (10) extended inside said casing (3) and having an inlet (11) for the return air (A1) and an outlet (12) for the return air (A1), said inlet (11) for the return air (A1) being adapted to be put in fluid communication with an environment (500) to be air-conditioned to allow said return air (A1), taken from the environment (500) to be air-conditioned, to enter the internal return duct (10), said outlet (12) for the return air (A1) being provided to discharge the return air (A1) in an environment (600) which is external with respect to the environment (500) to be air-conditioned;- an internal delivery duct (20), independent of the internal return duct (10), which extends inside said casing (3) and comprises an inlet (21) for the external air (A2) and a outlet (22) for the external air (A2), said inlet (21) for the external air (A2) being adapted to allow the external air (A2), taken from said external environment (600), to enter the internal delivery duct (20), said outlet (22) for the external air (A2) being adapted to be put in fluid communication with the environment to be air-conditioned (500) at the same time as the inlet (11) for the return air (A1), to introduce the external air (A2) into the environment to be air-conditioned (500);- a return fan (13) arranged in the internal return duct (10) to take the return air (A1) from the environment to be air-conditioned (500);- a delivery fan (23) arranged in the internal delivery duct (20) to introduce the external air (A2) into the environment to be air-conditioned (500);wherein said return fan (13) and said delivery fan (23) are controllable so as to be capable of regulating the flow of the return air (A1) through the internal return duct (10) and the flow of the external air (A2) through the internal delivery duct (20), respectively, to selectively establish a predetermined positive or negative pressure differential between said environment to be air-conditioned (500) and said external environment (600).
