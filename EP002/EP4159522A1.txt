abstract
    A method and an apparatus for torque control on a slippery road surface and a terminal device are provided. The method includes: presetting a torque-lower-limit-value, a first numerical value is a torque value recycled by the vehicle which is moving on the slippery road surface and performs an energy recovery normally during a coasting process, the second numerical value is a torque value that prevents a vehicle wheel from being locked on the slippery road surface, the second numerical value is greater than the first numerical value, and the torque-lower-limit-value is set to the first numerical value by default; setting, when an anti-lock braking system of the vehicle is activated, the torque-lower-limit-value as the second numerical value to reduce an absolute value of a reverse torque exerted on the vehicle wheel due to the energy recovery, and the vehicle wheel enters an anti-lock state; maintaining the anti-lock state of the vehicle wheel for a preset first time period; comparing the currently requested torque value with a preset third numerical value after the first time period is passed; and resetting the torque-lower-limit-value to the first numerical value to enable the vehicle wheel to exit the anti-lock state, if the currently requested torque value is greater than the third numerical value. By applying the method, it can be guaranteed that the vehicle moves on the slippery road surface smoothly, a driving experience is improved, and the safety of the vehicle is guaranteed accordingly.
