abstract
    Heat recovery boiler comprising:a flue-gases flowing chamber (11) extending along a longitudinal axis (A) and provided with an inlet (16) and an outlet (17);a steam circuit (14) fed with water and extended at least partially inside the flue-gases flowing chamber (11) in order to exploit the heat of the flue-gases to generate steam;an inlet diffuser (12) connected to the inlet (16) of the flue-gases flowing chamber (11) wherein flue-gases from a flue-gases source (9) flow in one advancing direction (D); at least one flow rectifier assembly (30; 31) arranged in the inlet diffuser (12) and configured to break the vortexes present in the flow through it; the flow rectifier assembly (30; 31) comprising a plurality of rectifier elements (35), each of which substantially extends from a first wall (22) of the inlet diffuser (12) to a second wall (22) opposite the first wall (22).
