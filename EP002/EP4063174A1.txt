abstract
    [Problem to be Solved]Provided is a control device for a vehicle that makes it possible to adjust deceleration while securing a regeneration amount.[Solution]In the case where an accelerator operation has been performed during execution of a fuel cut and regeneration (YES in step S2) and where the operation amount of the accelerator operation is smaller than a predetermined accelerator operation amount (NO in step S3), the ECM (50) maintains the fuel cut, and decreases the regeneration amount of the regeneration depending on increase in the operation amount of the accelerator operation (step S4). In the case where the operation amount of the accelerator operation has reached the predetermined accelerator operation amount (YES in step S3), the ECM (50) ends the fuel cut, and increases the regeneration amount (step S5). The predetermined accelerator operation amount is set to an operation amount when the regeneration amount decreases to zero.
