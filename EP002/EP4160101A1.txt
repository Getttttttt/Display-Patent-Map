abstract
    The present disclosure relates to a ventilation system for a room, the ventilation system comprising a first air passage (20) having a first air inlet (22) and a first air outlet (24); a first fan (26) configured to induce a first air flow from the first air inlet (22) through the first air passage (20) to the first air outlet (24), the first fan (26) having a first fan motor (28); and a controller (40) for controlling the ventilation system; wherein the controller (40) is configured to execute a safety operation i) when the first fan motor (28) is in an ON state and/or ii) when the controller (40) receives a signal indicating that a refrigerant leakage has been detected, wherein the controller (40) is configured to, in the safety operation, a) obtain, of the first fan motor (28), the electrical power and/or the electrical current and/or the electrical resistance during operation of the first fan motor (28) at a predetermined revolution speed or a predetermined DC voltage of the first fan motor (28); b) compare the obtained electrical power and/or the electrical current and/or the electrical resistance of the first fan motor (28) with a first threshold, wherein the first threshold is a predetermined threshold associated to a set minimum first air flow rate through the first air passage (20); c) initiate a measure when the obtained electrical power and/or the electrical current and/or the electrical resistance of the first fan motor (28) falls below the first threshold.
