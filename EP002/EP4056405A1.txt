abstract
    A vehicle control apparatus (50) has: a target value setting unit that sets a value of a target starting torque (Ttgt, Trq<sup>∗</sup>) for starting a vehicle (10), by gradually increasing the value of the target starting torque from 0 to a value of a prescribed torque; a control unit that performs switching control of an inverter (30) for controlling the torque generated by a rotary electric machine (20) to the value of the target starting torque; a state determination unit that determines whether a power storage device (31) is in a state in which charging is limited; and in response to determining that the power storage device is in the state in which the charging is limited, a regeneration limiting unit that, when the rotary electric machine is functioning as a generator, restricts a regeneration torque of the rotary electric machine to a greater degree when the charging of the power storage device is limited than when the charging is not limited. When it is determined that the power storage device is in the state in which the charging is limited, the target value setting unit reduces a rate at which the target starting torque increases from 0 to the prescribed torque, by comparison with the rate of increase to the prescribed torque when it is determined that the power storage device is in the state in which the charging is not limited.
