abstract
    The present invention relates to an air conditioning unit (1) for heating or cooling the air (A<sub>M</sub>) destined for an indoor environment (400). Said unit (1) comprises at least one refrigeration machine (5) that includes at least one refrigeration circuit (CF, CF<sub>1</sub>, CF<sub>2</sub>) configured to produce a refrigeration cycle with a respective operating fluid. This circuit comprises a first air-to-liquid/gas heat exchanger (11, 11-1, 11-2) configured to generate, in a first heat exchange section (110), a heat exchange between said operating fluid and the treated air (A<sub>M</sub>) destined for said indoor environment (400). The circuit further comprises a second air-to-liquid/gas heat exchanger (12, 12-1, 12-2) configured to generate, in a second heat exchange section (120), a heat exchange between said operating fluid and the air (A<sub>E</sub>) of the outdoor environment (500). According to the invention, the air conditioning unit comprises a third heat exchange section (130) comprising suction means for sucking return air (A<sub>R</sub>) coming from the indoor environment (400) into a chamber (30) partially delimited by a portion (12B, 12-1B, 12-2B) of the second heat exchanger (12, 12-1, 12-2) so that the return air (A<sub>R</sub>) sucked into this chamber (30) is ejected into said outdoor environment (500) through said second portion (12B, 12-1B, 12-2B) of said second heat exchanger (12, 12-1, 12-2).
