abstract
    In a first corrugated portion (11) of a first heat transfer plate (1), first front-side convex portions (14) that are convex toward one side in a first direction and first back-side convex portions (15) that are convex toward the opposite side in the first direction are alternately formed along a second direction. On a second corrugated portion (21) of a second heat transfer plate (2), second front-side convex portions (24) that are convex toward one side in the first direction and second back-side convex portions (25) that are convex toward the opposite side in the first direction are alternately formed along the second direction. At at least one end of both ends of each of the first front-side convex portions (14) in the second direction, there is provided a first front-side protruding portion (16) that protrudes toward another first front-side convex portions (14) adjacent in the second direction. The first front-side protruding portion (16) is contactable with the second heat transfer plate (2). At at least one end of both ends of each of the second front-side convex portions (24) in the second direction, there is provided a second front-side protruding portion (26) that protrudes toward another second front-side convex portions (24) adjacent in the second direction. The second front-side protruding portion (26) is contactable with the first heat transfer plate (1).
