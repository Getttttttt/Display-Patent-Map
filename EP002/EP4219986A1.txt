abstract
    3-way fluid valve (30), having a housing (31) providing a first connection port (32), a second connection port (33) and a third connection port (34), a valve plunger (35) 5 positioned within the housing (31), an actuator (36) for actuating the valve plunger (35) and for transferring the valve plunger (35) and thereby the 3-way fluid valve(30) between different states, wherein in a first state of the valve plunger (35) and 3-way fluid valve (30) a fluid flow through the first connection port (32) and throughthe second connection port (33) and through the third connection port (34) are all 10 blocked, wherein in a second state of the valve plunger (35) and 3-wayfluid valve (30) only a fluid flow through the first connection port (32) is blocked allowing a fluid flow from the second connection port (33) to the third connection port (34), wherein in a third state of the valve plunger (35) and 3-way fluid valve (30) only a fluid flow through third connection port (34) is blocked allowing a fluid flow from the first con-15 nection port (32) to the second connection port (33).
