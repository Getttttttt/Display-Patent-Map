abstract
    The present invention relates to a drying plant for desiccating paper material, preferably in the form of a tape, the said drying plant comprising:- At least one drying roll (112) fed with steam in such a way as to heat up and on which the paper material to be dried is arranged in use;- At least one hood (114) arranged in such a way as to wrap, at least partially, the said drying roll, the said hood being configured in such a way as to send onto the said drying roll a drying airflow which hits the said drying roll and being further configured to suck in the damp drying flow going up in use from the paper material under drying positioned on the said drying roll;- At least one first separating tank (101) configured to separate the steam from the condensate and placed into fluid communication with the said drying roll in such a way as to receive the fluid coming from the said drying roll and separate steam from condensate;- and wherein a heat exchanger (104) is comprised;- said heat exchanger being placed into fluid communication with said first separating tank through a first part of a conduit (103) which connects said first separating tank with said heat exchanger;- and wherein a pump (102) arranged along the said first part of conduit is comprised, the pump being therefore interposed between said heat exchanger and the first tank and with the said pump configured to push the condensate contained into said tank towards the heat exchanger;- Characterized by the fact of comprising a second tank (108), said second tank being a second separating tank configured to separate steam from condensate and placed into fluid communication with the said heat exchanger through a second part of a conduit (107), said second part of conduit being without pump, the said pump arranged in the first part being configured in such a way as to push the condensate coming from the first separating tank into the heat exchanger (104) and contextually push the consequent fluid obtained from said heat exchanger towards the second separating tank (108), the said second tank being connected to a third part of a conduit (109) configured to send the steam, separated from the condensate, in outlet from said second separating tank, said third part of conduit connecting to the said drying roll (112) in such a way that the drying roll can receive the obtained steam and coming from said second separating tank and wherein, further, the said second separating tank provides an outlet for discharging condensate.
