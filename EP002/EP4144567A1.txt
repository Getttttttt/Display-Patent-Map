abstract
    A rail-guided vehicle system (1) is a rail-guided vehicle system (1) connecting between floors having a difference in height and including a descending rail (T21) for a travel vehicle (6) to move downward. The descending rail (T21) of the rail-guided vehicle system (1) is arranged in a helical manner and has a rail (4) forming a first section (71) where energy is generated when a brake (53) included in the travel vehicle (6) works and a rail (4) forming a second section (72) where energy that has been generated when a travel vehicle traveled in the first section (71) is consumed.
