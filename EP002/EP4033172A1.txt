abstract
    A heat exchange cell (1) for a heating condensing boiler, comprising a heat exchanger (10) comprising at least one tubular pipe (11) adapted to be traveled by a fluid to be heated, helically wound about a helix axis (L-L) according to a plurality of helical coils (12, 13, 14), and defining a free central space adapted to form a combustion chamber (15), ending with a first end coil (13) and an opposite last end coil (14) evaluated along said helix axis (L-L); a container casing (40) containing said heat exchanger (10) mounted therein, comprising a side casing wall (41) arranged radially outside, and about said heat exchanger (10) forming a fume collection chamber (16) radially interposed between said exchanger (10) and said side casing wall (41) adapted to receive combustion fumes (17) generated in the combustion chamber (15) after said fumes (17) have transferred heat to said fluid to be heated in said at least one tubular pipe (11), said container casing (40) further defining a front casing end (45) comprising a casing opening (42) surrounded by an annular casing edge (43) having the center on said helix axis (L-L) wherein a first end coil (13) of said plurality (12, 13, 14) is facing said casing opening (42); an annular closing flange (50) arranged coaxially to said helix axis (L-L) defining a radially outer annular flange edge portion (53) and a radially inner annular flange edge portion (54) with respect to said helix axis (L-L), the radially outer annular flange edge portion (53) being continuously and sealingly coupled to said annular casing edge (43), and the radially inner annular flange edge portion (54) defining a central flange opening (55) for allowing access inside the combustion chamber (15), wherein said closing flange (50) is made of sheet metal and is entirely formed by molding in a single piece, and wherein said closing flange (50) comprises an annular contact portion (56) coaxial to said helix axis (L-L), said annular contact portion (56) being arranged in direct contact and sealingly with at least one corresponding annular portion (13') of the outer surface (13") of said first end coil (13); and wherein said closing flange (50) comprises an annular sealing portion (57) coaxial to said helix axis (L-L); a removable closing door (80) configured to removably close said central flange opening (55) when said closing door (80) is tightened to said closing flange (50) in a closed position, said closing door (80) defining an annular door edge portion (81) configured to be coupled to said annular sealing portion (57) of said flange; wherein said annular sealing portion (57) of said closing flange (50) is arranged not in contact with, and detached from the outer surface (13'') of said first end coil (13) and partially delimits said fume collection chamber (16); and wherein said annular sealing portion (57) of said closing flange (50) is at least partially arranged radially outside said annular contact portion (56), in a radial direction, orthogonal to the helix axis (L-L).
