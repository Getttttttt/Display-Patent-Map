abstract
    It is provided an electric vehicle (10) battery charging system (1), capable of being interconnected with external direct current power supply infrastructures (11), in which the infrastructure (11) is tram and/or trolleybus and comprises at least a first high potential power supply channel (11a) and a second low potential power channel (11b) so as to determine a power supply voltage, in which the system (1) comprises at least one recharging device (2) configured to be connected to an external electrical network, in such a way as to be able at least to withdraw electrical energy from the external electrical network, and to be connected to at least one first battery (EVB<sub>1</sub>) of an electric vehicle to deliver or receive electricity to or from the first respectively battery (EVB<sub>1</sub>), and in which the external electrical network is constituted by the infrastructure (11) and the recharging device (2) is configured to be operationally connected to the first channel (11a) and to said second channel (11b) so as to receive or transfer electricity from or to the infrastructure (11) with the power supply voltage and to modulate the power supply voltage in or out of the recharging device (2).
